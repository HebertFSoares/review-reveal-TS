        "content": "Iffy at times, but <em>'16 Blocks'</em> produces a fine enough thriller - one that I can say I enjoyed.\r\n\r\nBruce Willis and Mos Def double up well as Jack and Eddie. I particularly like Willis' look for the majority of the film, he genuinely looks how his character supposedly is - good acting, but also some nice make-up etc. \r\n\r\nMos Def is solid, I remember liking him when he appeared on <em>'Dexter'</em> - I rate him less here, just because of the annoying voice he has; which grates hard at times. Speaking of that Showtime television show, Angel Batista himself (David Zayas) also appears which is cool. David Morse, meanwhile, makes for an OK villain - the casting perhaps could've been greater for the antagonist, mind.\r\n\r\nNone of the plot is all that shocking or surprising, every crossroad that appears is pretty simple to predict where it's heading. Also, maybe I'm the only one who felt this, but there's one moment on a bus where it seems as if Jack is about to unleash some unbelievable secret plan but it just fizzles out into oddly nothing. Might be just me.\r\n\r\nAll in all though, I reckon you'll be able to find a satisfactory 105 minutes with this - I did, at least."

        "content": "16 Blocks is an incredibly atmospheric movie with some quite incredibly done street scenes. Its intensity draws you in and makes you quickly form strong opinions of each character. I initially considered Mos Def's character to be annoying, but after a number of watches I realised if he hadn't given his character so much character then he would have been inconsequential and that would have weakened the movie severely. I think Bruce Willis was very brave to take the part of Jack Mosley and commit to it in the way he did. He makes this film what it is."

        "content": "A small film that somehow restores your faith in life, in people, in, well,… everything\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2006 and written & directed by Brad Silberling, “10 Items or Less” is a drama about an aged has-been actor (Morgan Freeman) who researches for an indie gig after a four-year dry spell. He meets a spitfire checkout clerk named Scarlet (Paz Vega) at a supermarket in a Latino community of Los Angeles. Impressed by the young woman, he decides to help her while psyching-up for the role.          \r\n\r\nThe plot is obviously borrowed from 2003’s “Lost in Translation.” To key you off, the girl is named after Scarlett Johansson. But don’t let that keep you from seeing this minor gem because the characters are very different, plus other nuances. For instance, Morgan’s character (simply called “Him” in the cast list) reflects the “joy of living” (joie de vivre) as opposed to Bill Murray’s amusing curmudgeon in “Lost in Translation.” \r\n\r\nMoreover, “10 Items” is less melancholy; and the girl isn’t naïve and overly sweet like Charlotte (Johansson) in “Lost.” It’s a small film, with the end credits rolling a mere ten minutes after the hour mark, and so it lacks the depth of “Lost” and isn’t as moving (at least as far as pulling your romantic heartstrings), but it’s more heartwarming and overall inspiring.              \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 21 minutes and was shot in Brentwood, Los Angeles, and nearby Carson (to the south). \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

I like the fresh new story and the fact that all four of the youngsters remain, but the change from dark, snowy settings to plain, summer-like conditions means the film does lose some spark. There's also much less intrigue with the villains.\r\n\r\nGeorgie Henley (Lucy), William Moseley (Peter), Anna Popplewell (Susan) and Skandar Keynes (Edmund) are again enjoyable in their roles. Liam Neeson, just barely, reprises his role of Aslan - his inclusion does feel forced, as great a character as he is.\r\n\r\nAway from those four, you have a number of new faces. Ben Barnes (Caspian), Peter Dinklage (Trumpkin), Warwick Davis (Nikabrik) and Eddie Izzard (Reepicheep) are my standouts. Barnes is solid, I liked watching Caspian. Dinklage is great, while Davis and Izzard are welcomed newbies. Like the first film, the casting here is done astutely.\r\n\r\nThey definitely should've shortened this though, the ending does drag a fair bit. There's also a couple of different moments that feel like the end, yet evidently aren't - there's certainly more than a few pacing issues.\r\n\r\nWith all that said, I still had a more than decent time watching."

Unfortunately, what we end up with is a beautifully crafted, but overly melodramatic story of a couple who find their marriage is over. When they drive to Naples to sell a villa Sanders has inherited, they discover during their journey - and once they arrive, that they just don't know each other any more. Whatever they did have in common at the start of their eight year marriage has long since departed leaving them with only a shell of a relationship and a veneer of affection with both really yearning for freedom, not just from each other, but from their tried and tested existence. I found Bergman to be quite sterile, her performance aloof and distant - but not in a characterful way; more high-maintenance ice maiden-ish. Sanders is what he always is: he has panache and style but again, his heart just didn't seem to be in it - on any level. Some magnificent cinematography of the Neopolitan countryside, and some interesting scenes filmed in/around Pompeii give the film a little bit more, but ultimately I found it all just a little empty...."

As the crew, and their hot headed Navy Seal passengers, get down deeper, it would seem they are not alone down there.\r\n\r\nThe Abyss is a flawed movie when put under the microscope, even allowing for the reinserted (and much better) ending that James Cameron was forced to cut by idiot studio executives. Most glaringly obvious as a fault is that The Abyss, after holding us for 2 hours of engrossing cinema, can't quite seal the deal as a deep (hrr hrr hrr) message movie for the modern era. What isn't in doubt upon revisits to the piece is that it's at times spectacular, at others it's joyously ambitious, both things coming together in one big loud boom of being a blockbuster with brains. James Cameron can never be accused of not trying to entertain the masses, and here, with a bit more thought on a humanist level, then we would have been talking in the realms of masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe making of the film is itself worthy of a movie, a fraught and angry shoot with many problems, of which I wont bore you with as they can be found at the click of a mouse. But Cameron pushes hard because he wants to please and dazzle, and he does, every buck and sweat drop is up there on the screen to be witnessed. The lead actors put in great work, Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio give the film its centrifugal emotive heart as the warring Brigham's, while Cameron fave Michael Biehn does a fine line in Gung-Ho decompression nut case! The technical aspects do dazzle, the visual effects rightly won the Academy Award in that department, and both the cinematography (Mikael Salomon) and art design (Dilley/Kuljian) are worth the price of a rental alone.\r\n\r\nIt's true to say that The Abyss is a fusion of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind & The Day The Earth Stood Still, but really I don't personally see anything wrong with that! As a spectacle it rewards the patient in spades, as a deeply profound moving picture it falls just about short, but even then a less than 100% Cameron picture is still one hell of a ride to be on. 8.5/10"

        "content": "When you watch some of Nicolas Cage's more recent stuff you do wonder how on earth he ever became a star in the first place. Well, this is one of the films that reminds us why. He is a struggling screenwriter (\"Charlie\") charged with adapting a novel about orchids written by \"Susan Orlean\" (Meryl Streep). Mental block would be putting it mildly - he simply has no idea how to make it work for \"Valerie\" (easily one of the less abstruse roles played by Tilda Swinton). Moreover, he is constantly hassled by his twin brother \"Donald\" who is writing his own story - one that his sibling thinks is riddled with flaws and inconsistencies. The book he must adapt centres around the activities of \"Laroche\" (Chris Cooper) who had a habit of going with his Seminole pals to remove rare plants from a nature reserve. Illegal? Well not if you know your way around the Floridian penal code, and the ensuing court case is what entices \"New Yorker\" reporter \"Orlean\" to write his story. Initially sceptical of her rather uncouth subject matter - not helped by his missing front teeth, she discovers there is much more to the man and his provision of a green powder soon helps her to relax! What now ensues nicely marries the threads of the storylines as both Cage characters, an excellently enigmatic Cooper, and the unfulfilled Miss Streep find themselves gradually drawn together for an admittedly pretty far-fetched denouement (pronounce denooeymont). Cage plays the two characters with considerable skill; he juggles his characters' frustrations with his writing, his love life, his brother and his own reluctance to meet the author engagingly and at times he can make you squirm in your seat a bit. There is plenty of humour, and the all but two hours just flies by. If nothing else, it does make you appreciate just how difficult is is to turn a novel into a film - and might explain why so few people are actually any good at it!"

        "content": "This is one of those utterly satisfying film experiences that seem to exploit every possibility of the cinematic medium\r\n\r\nThe French New Wave drew much inspiration from American crime stories, and Jean-Luc Godard's 1965 film PIERROT LE FOU has a plot that is essentially simple: Ferdinand (Jean-Paul Belmondo), five years into a marriage that leaves him unsatisfied, meets his children's babysitter and discovers that she's an old flame of his, Marianne (Anna-Karina). They both want to run away, and as it turns out that Marianne already has some experience in the criminal underworld, the pair steal some cash and head towards the south of France. On their way to what they hope is a better life, they leave a trail of more crimes in their wake. However, tension builds between the two, as Pierre is mopey, obsessed with literature, and pessimistic, while Marianne is a capricious and spontaneous personality who doesn't want to think about the future. When they are confronted by some other gangsters in Nice, things come to a head.\r\n\r\nBut it is the extremely elaborate way in which this story is told that elevates this from a cheap thriller to a masterpiece of avant-garde cinema. Scenes are depicted with exaggerated features, often becoming absurdist metaphors for the action that the audience should understand has happened. Two dialogues between the lovers turn into musical numbers. Even in straightforward thriller plot turns like shootouts, Godard avoids any pretence at realism. The old Brechtian technique of alienation, where the audience is continually reminded that they are watching staged action and not the real thing, is thus abundantly employed. Furthermore, Godard confronts 1960s consumer society and the Vietnam War.\r\n\r\nIt's modernist and highly personal, sure, but PIERROT LE FOU is also instantly accessible to an open-minded audience due to its pop art feel. The colours in the elaborate set designs and landscapes are electric, it's as if Godard and cinematographer Raoul Coutard in 1965 saw brighter shades of everything than we do today, and could bring that hyper-sensory perception across on film. Karina and Belmondo are not only masterful actors in themselves, they also have great chemistry together. When it all comes down to it, PIERROT LE FOU is simply an emotionally moving film. After I saw it the first time, I felt as if my life had changed forever, and I swiftly scheduled another viewing (the film continues to impress on rewatching).\r\n\r\nI don't know if this would be the best introduction to Godard. However, there is an especial pleasure in seeing his films in chronological order and coming to PIERROT LE FOU after the director's nine preceding feature films. Godard packed this film's storytelling technique, costumes, film score, and other elements with references to each of the movies he had made to date. These little winks, looks back at a productive and already storied career that in fact had only started six years before, are fun for aficionados.\r\n\r\nThe Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-Ray and DVD in 2008. Unfortunately, this release swiftly fell out of print after Criterion lost the North American rights. That's a real shame, as the Blu-Ray presents this visually gorgeous film in the HD format it deserves, and there are many interesting extras on both the Blu-Ray and the 2DVD set: an hour-long documentary on Godard and Karina's time working together, an interview with the elderly Karina made just for Criterion, archival interviews with cast and crew, and a featurette where Jean-Pierre Gorin presents the themes of the PIERROT LE FOUR in an audio track over excerpts from the film."

Well, despite the number of times I have watched this film, it does the same as that stylus. I just don't really get it. It centres around the slightly Bonnie and Clyde existence of the married and recently unemployed television executive \"Ferdinand\" (Jean Paul Belmondo) and his flighty ex-babysitter \"Marianne\" (Anna Karina) as they travel across France trying to make a Bohemian sort of living whilst she avoids some Algerian gangsters from whom she has worked smuggling guns. Now we know from the start that these two have a bit of history - she continuously calls him \"Pierrot\" - much to his chagrin, but different as they are, and rather despite themselves, together they must remain as their escapades become more perilous, quirky and their personalities emerge stronger and clearer. I get all of that, it's a road movie - a colourful, occasionally entertaining one - with a certain, though not overwhelming - degree of chemistry between the two handsome stars. The scenarios though, are all a bit repetitive and too much of the significance of the film seems attached to the former relationship (off screen) between Karina and Jean Luc Godard. Perhaps it is based on their own life, but what has that to do with what we are watching on the screen now? Sure, it's a well photographed and flee flowing story, but too much of the significance of the plot and the characterisation is reserved to those \"in the know\" and so I just found it, increasingly, a rather unremarkable semi-comical romp. It's highly rated, so I am probably just out of kilter - but for me this is really nothing much to write home about."

But it ain't me you gotta worry about now.\r\n\r\nPitch Black is directed by David Twohy and collectively written by Twohy and Ken and Jim Wheat. It stars Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black and Rhiana Griffith. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography is by David Eggby. \r\n\r\nThe year 2000 was awash with sci-fi movies, not all were stellar of course, but siting at the top end of the scale was this, Twohy's super slice of action/horror/sci-fi cake. \r\n\r\nRight from the off we are thrust on board the cargo ship Hunter-Gratzner, which as it happens is plummeting through space. The ship has been hit by meteorite debris and junior officer Caroline Fly (Mitchell), after coming out of hyper sleep, manages to crash land on a nearby planet. Only a handful of passengers survive the crash, including infamous convict Richard B. Riddick (Diesel), but as the survivors struggle to cope with the threat from within the group, it becomes apparent that there's a bigger threat soon to join the party, a deadly alien species, a species that can only operate in the dark. Pity, then, that an eclipse is due... \r\n\r\nOkies, so lets get the obvious out in the open right away, Pitch Black is a variant of Alien, one of a ream of films that grabbed the coat tails of Ridley Scott's game changer. Yet this is still a fresh movie, a lesson in low budget film making with grace, style, blood, brains and balls - the execution grade \"A\" from those involved. \r\n\r\nIt's maybe surprising given the synopsis, to find that it's a very character driven piece, with Twohy continually building his characters even as the carnage and terror is unleashed - and these are a very diverse bunch of characters. One of the universe's baddest criminals, a spunky lady officer having to take command, a morphine addicted bounty hunter, an Islamic priest and his young companions, a camp alcoholic and a couple of strays. It's the not so wild bunch, but everyone of them are afforded chance to impact on the story before and during the inevitable picking off one by one at the claws of the beasts. \r\n\r\nThe narrative strength comes via Diesel's hulking convict, he's double jointed and has had optical surgery so he can see his enemies in the dark! The group must come to rely on him for he is clearly their best hope of survival, but can he be trusted? What is his ultimate ulterior motive? Riddick is the épée to Fry's foil, it's at times like a devil and angel trying to become one in the simple name of survival. These crux characters lift the simple premise to greater heights, that Mitchell (sexy/vulnerable/hard/smart) and Diesel (moody/beefy/gravelly/menacing) are bang on form helps no end. As does the work of the tech department. \r\n\r\nThe setting created here is a splendid veer from one of the curses of sci-fi films, that of an unbelievable world. Twohy, Eggby and the art department achieve a world of 3 suns, of a scorched barren landscape, with the photography switching between bleached and metallic filters for maximum sci-fi impact. While the effects work belies the budget, check out the pre-eclipse sequence. What of the creatures themselves? They are legion, a sort of pterodactyl nightmare who let out high pitched bleats, they smell blood and move at high speeds, and like Riddick they have special vision in the dark, it's the light that they are afraid of, thus this gives our survivors a glimmer (ahem) of hope in how to stave them off... \r\n\r\nThe science and logic is hokey, but so what? This is a classy and taut sci-fi film brought about by a very under valued director, one that puts many a bigger budgeted Hollywood production to shame. Come the finale, where there's still time to have your draw dropped, you may be minus nails and on the edge of your seat. 9/10"

With the publication, very shy, of her first editions, the writer's financial situation improved, and public recognition begin to appear. Sadly, the author died quite young, without collect the fruits of her talent.\r\n\r\nI am not an expert on Jane Austen, but this is, very briefly, the author's biography, almost sketched in a stream. The film focuses on her youth and builds romantic fiction around her. Personally, I'm dubious about much of what happens in this movie. I think much of it is romantic invention, almost turning Austen into one of her own characters, torn between the attention of two very different suitors.\r\n\r\nThe film is not bad, but it is far from flawless and will never be one of the reference “biopics”, at least in my understanding. Julian Jarrold's direction was effective, but he gives us a work that bets more on the construction of the characters and the story than on the relationship between the film and the real life of the biographed person. The cinematography is good and there are some good effects. The soundtrack is mediocre. The period recreation was reasonably done, resorting to decent costumes and good locations and sets. In between, however, there are some grotesque errors and anachronisms: in the ball scene, Jane appears with a dress twenty years ahead of the time, in another scene we see wedding rings, something that did not exist at that time, and in another one we see Jane being recognized as the writer of a novel when, in fact, she published anonymously several of her books and got very little recognition in her lifetime. Even her epitaph, on her tomb in Winchester Cathedral, ignored her literary output until it was replaced by new text in the late 19th century.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, the extraordinary dramatic interpretation of the actors stands out, and especially Anne Hathaway, who gave the character a touch of kindness mixed with a marked rebelliousness and nonconformity. She didn't want to be like other women. James McAvoy also does a very interesting job in this film and deserves our full attention. The film also has good performances by James Cromwell, Julie Walters, Maggie Smith and Ian Richardson."

It stars Michael Keaton, Melanie Griffith, Matthew Modine, Laurie Metcalf and Mako. Music is by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Amir M. Mokri.\r\n\r\nYoung couple Patty and Drake plough all their resources into buying a large house in the affluent Pacific Heights area of San Francisco. With two apartments to rent they think their numbers have come in when they manage to find tenants for both. But one man, the mysterious Carter Hayes (Keaton), soon proves to be anything but the perfect tenant…\r\n\r\nThere are twin terrors at work here, one is the tenant from hell, the other is the laws that protect him as he manipulates the system to its very stupid core. The makers do a very good job of making the film unsettling throughout, the ghastly menace who invades someone’s home and holds all the ace cards is a constant terrifying presence.\r\n\r\nSchlesinger for two thirds of the piece crafts a tightly wound thriller, unfortunately it just gets too daft for its own good as the cat and mousery reaches the culmination of plotting. Keaton is great, expanding upon the dark part of Bruce Wayne portrayal to be scarily smooth and convincing. Griffith is good value as well, and it’s great to see a female character showing great resourcefulness, but both actors are let down by Pyne’s screenplay in the last third where the psycho versus good lady section is too far fetched. Whilst Modine isn’t a good enough actor to pull off the furious husband act.\r\n\r\nA mixed bag, but mostly it beats a good thriller heart to keep it above average. 6.5/10"

Check out a long sequence of events involving the pair hiding out in a closet, it's gold dusted cinema. \r\n\r\nThe film's central plot involves Hepburn & O'Toole planning a daring robbery from a Paris museum to keep her art forger Father (a delightful Hugh Griffith) out of trouble, at first the couple are purely business partners with no love lost for each other, but as the story plays out the pair are forced to get along and etc. \r\n\r\nThe burglary itself is dramatic, attention grabbing entertainment, and it's also the film's highest point, but overall the film as a whole is simply good romantic fun. Also helps that it features a very tidy shift for the finale to further reward the audience for their time spent with the movie. Throw in dapper turns from Charles Boyer & Eli Wallach too, and it's all good really. \r\n\r\nOpen the wine, sit back and relax with Pete & Audrey. 8/10"

Chase\" (George Peppard), his friend \"Cpl. Trower\" (George Hamilton) and savvy sergeant \"Joe\" (Eli Wallach) face just about every hazard as we start shortly after they land in Sicily and end up (well some of them do) in Berlin. The combat elements of the film are unremarkable, to be honest, but what is striking here is the roles of the women. Starting with a super effort from the emotionally ravaged French lady whose home they must commandeer (Jean Moreau), then the clever and manipulative club owner \"Magda\" (Melina Mercouri) and finally \"Helga\" (Elke Summer) and \"Trudi\" (Senta Berger) who must make the most from the occupying powers in Berlin. It is their perspectives that make this a bit different and that contribute most to the humanity of this all but 3 hour marathon. At times it has an episodic feel to it, which I found disjointed the narrative a bit, and unfortunately the main casting - especially the really weak Hamilton, but with the exception of the on-form Wallach, just let the side down. There is far too much ponderous dialogue and Carl Foreman struggles at times to keep this frequently rambling drama engaging. It has a very strong supporting cast, and there are some nice touches now and again from the likes of Mervyn Johns and Romy Schneider to help it along, and give us a breather from the intensity of the wartime imagery. It is not a bad film this, but there is just too much chaff amongst the wheat."

This time, the Communists kidnap \"Susanne\" (Claire Bloom) - she happens to be the sister of British officer \"Martin\" (Geoffrey Toone) and we are now presented with an intriguing and internecine series of spy and counter-spy scenarios that revolve around the dubious \"Ivo\" (James Mason) with whom the missing woman had been associating with - and has fallen for. It transpires that she is being held so that they can use her as leverage for the return of \"Kastner\" (Ernst Schröder), a lawyer with a distinctly dodgy pre-war past. It now falls to \"Ivo\" to rescue her and smuggle her to safety. Desmond Dickinson's dark and eery photography - especially in what's left of the heavily bombed out Berlin - coupled with a seedy and effective John Addison score work well to create an atmospheric environment. I didn't love Mason's rather unreliable German accent, but Bloom is quite effective and there are compensating and strong supporting contributions from an on-form Hildegard Knef (\"Bettina\") and from Aribert Wäscher as the untrustworthy \"Halendar\" as the plot twists and turns towards quite a menacing and tightly shot denouement. The narrative is tight, the romance sparing, it is frequently quite compelling to watch and it does have a ring of plausibility to it. A superior crime drama well worth a watch."

It stars Bud Abbott, Lou Costello and Boris Karloff. Plot finds Bud and Lou as two coppers in old time London who become involved with the hunt for a monstrous killer. A hunt that brings them into contact with the mysterious Dr. Jekyll.\r\n\r\nIt would be the fourth from last movie the popular comedy duo would make together, and the latest to see them paired with a famous monster from 30's cinema. Although it's a touch weak in the comedy stakes, and it does kind of feel like they are winding down after such a fruitful career, the film holds up well as a polished picture. The writers have varied the Jekyll & Hyde legend by actually having Jekyll himself be evil, wonderfully essayed by Karloff, and a couple of sequences are genuinely laugh out loud funny: think mouse head, think hypodermic needle; while the involvement of the Suffragettes in the story gives it some historical interest. It's also good on atmosphere, be it the moody streets of London, or Costello alone in a wax museum, Lamont and photographer George Robinson give it a creepy veneer before the anarchy breaks out.\r\n\r\nUnlikely to encourage new fans to their work, but a safe addition for those who enjoy the majority of their output. 7/10"

Music is by John Morris and cinematography by Gerald Hirschfeld.\r\n\r\nFilmed in black and white, Brook's movie is an affectionate spoof of the Frankenstein movies that came out of Universal Studios back in the 1930s.\r\n\r\nThere wolf, there castle.\r\n\r\nYou are either a Mel Brooks fan or not, there doesn't seem to be any middle ground. However, even his most ardent fans admit not all of his productions have paid dividends, but when on song, as he was in 1974 (Blazing Saddles also released), it's justifiable that those fans proclaim him as a spoof maestro. Ineviatbly a bit tame when viewed today, Young Frankenstein is still a picture of high comedy and clinical execution of the film making craft. Everything works, from acting performances, the gags that are both visual and aural delights, to the set design of the Frankenstein castle. It also boasts a smooth storyline, this is not a hodge-podge of ideas lifted from those Universal monster classics, it has a spin on the story and inserts its own memorable scenes along the way (Puttin' on the Ritzzzzzzzz, Oh my!).\r\n\r\nOf its time for sure, but still great entertainment for the Mel Brooks fan. 8/10"

It is a spoof - and James Whale ought to be writ large in the credits, as should Glenn Miller and a host of others who have inadvertently contributed to the wonderfully paced script that rarely draws breath. Wilder - the grandson of the eponymous, famously mad scientist - decides to visit Transylvania where he stumbles upon a formula that might just bring the dead back to life. In my view, the acting plaudits go to Marty Feldman, who is great as henchman \"Igor\" trying desperately to foil the over-the-top antics of the star - who just seems to play each role he takes on in the same, super-hammy, fashion with big eyes and loud, grand gestures that I find most unfunny. Coupled with Brooks, they are, however, on cracking writing form and as parodies go this sets up the whole genre - sometimes overtly and sometimes subtly, but regardless - when you listen to the dialogue you can't help but laugh. For me, it could have done with a less annoying star - but the writing has stood the test of time well and is still very much worth a watch."

Without any lines of dialogue, the filmmakers and Boris Karloff had to use actions and emotions to display the motivations of the monster, and they did a fantastic job of it. The fear, confusion, and longing that the novel describes are evident in the monster's actions, to the point of pushing the audience to root for him.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are also a bit of fun. Baron Frankenstein, played by Fred Kerr, was also a hoot. He played a no-nonsense character that functioned well in the comic-relief role needed with Edward Van Sloan's Dr. Wladman and Mae Clarke's Elizabeth being quite serious, even dramatic. Colin Clive, the man who played Doctor Henry, did a decent job in his role as well, pulling off the role of being consumed by his work, even when he desired to be free from it. \r\n\r\nThe acting, overall, was a touch more theatrical than I would prefer in a horror movie, but it wasn't so distracting that it pulled me out of the film. The film is a ton of fun to watch, but I do have to say it isn't exactly terrifying. The atmospheric creepiness is somewhat lacking compared to modern-era horror, even going back fifty years. That being said, the movie, if thought about and rewatched, does a good job of displaying how the fear of the unknown, and letting that fear take over, can be the real monster."

Now I know what it feels like to be God! \r\n\r\nWe will always see debates about which of the original wave of Universal Monster movies is the most important. With Dracula being released just under a year before Frankenstein, that tends to give the vampire crowd a sense of justifiable cause for a trumpet fanfare. Perhaps the more pertinent question is which is the better movie? Surely the most hardened of Dracula fans have to bow their heads in acknowledgement that Frankenstein quite simply is superior on every level - even if it itself is not as good as its sequel...\r\n\r\nNarrative doesn't quite follow Mary Shelley's original source material (what a brain that lady had!), but the core essence of a tragic tale holds tight. Directing was one James Whale, who here was in his directorial infancy, he himself up for debate about greatest horror genre directors, but his masterful sense of theatrical staging, and that of the terror incarnate for the era, is sublime to the point that come 100 years after its release this will still be held up as a timeless horror classic.\r\n\r\nThe thematics of the story pulse with brilliance, the advent of berserker science, the alienation and confusion flow of the creature grips and stings the heart equally. The later camp of Whale's horror ventures is mostly absent here, instead we have a dark almost miserably bleak tone, which exists right up to the end title card which brings closure after the brilliant and iconic finale has made its mark. Jack Pierce's marvelous make-up and the birth of Karloff as a genre legend seals the deal on what is without doubt one of the genre's most important films. 9/10"

But that's never really been my jam. _Frankenstein_ might have been great for the time, I don't know, I wasn't there, but I personally only ever found it to be okay.

The acting and the dialogue are a bit on the basic side, especially from Clarke, but even now this looks great on a big screen and plays wonderfully to the attitudes and superstitions of the time - of writing and production.

Some of them are so bad they're funny. This is quite well known. What I didn't know was that there had been a TV series in the past that made fun of these movies. “Mystery Science Theater 3000” was a series that never aired in Portugal and that I only became aware of when researching this film. Now I understand better certain things that I didn't realize when I was watching it, but even so, I feel that it is a film that is not for me.\r\n\r\nBefore writing, I went to see an episode or two of the original series to compare. What the film did was, essentially, a movie episode. The differences are minimal, and that seems a bit lazy to me right off the bat. There are lots of films based on good TV series, and it's not uncommon for the opposite to happen, but generally there is an effort, on the part of those who make the films, to give us something different, even if the base is there. That didn't happen here.\r\n\r\nAlso, the film tries to make witty jokes based on the older film, but it splatters roundly on the floor with each one. First, because there is a bad placement of the jokes, which happens before we even realize why, as if it were a spoiler. And then, because they are dull jokes, a type of humor that seems like it would only have a chance to work at the expense of a few very alcoholic drinks. I just don't like humor like that, and therefore the movie didn't have any jokes. Luckily, it was a fairly brief movie, just over an hour, or I would have stopped and moved on to something really more interesting."

If I ever find peace I'll find it here.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to revitalise their monster franchise at the box offices, Universal hit on the idea of of featuring more than one monster in a movie. Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man was to be the first of many such ventures.\r\n\r\nLon Chaney Jr is back as Larry Talbot/The Wolf Man, who after being awoken by unsuspecting grave robbers, is once again tortured by his curse and desperately wants an end to his misery. Seeking out the Gypsy woman Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya), the pair of them head off to find Dr. Frankenstein in the hope of finding a solution. He's dead, though, but there's another scientist on hand for help and as the villagers once again take unkindly to someone rekindling old nightmares, all while the Frankenstein Monster (Bela Lugosi) is found preserved in ice...\r\n\r\nIt's in effect a sequel to both The Wolf Man and The Ghost of Frankenstein, though as would become the norm, Monster Frank is a bit part player in a film bearing his name. The film is delightfully brisk and with Chaney doing good work as the tortured Talbot - with the relationship between Maleva and himself quite touching - the story carries emotional weight. However, Lugosi doesn't look right for the role of the monster, Patrick Knowles' switcharoo to a mad scientist is ill thought out, while the big smack down finale is sadly all too brief.\r\n\r\nNobody in the film, except maybe Chaney, was done any favours in the editing and writing rooms, but it's still a whole bunch of fun for fans of the Universal Monsters series. 6/10"

Lee and starring Basil Rathbone as Baron Frankenstein, Boris Karloff as The Monster (his last turn as the creature), Lionel Atwill as Inspector Krogh and Bela Lugosi as Ygor. That's quite a cast list, add in a sharp script from Willis Cooper and the stunning sets from Russell Gausman, and you got a sequel that's well worth its salt.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from Bride Of Frankenstein (25 years later), the film sees son of Frankenstein Baron Wolf von Frankenstein (Rathbone) return to the family home and scene of his fathers monstrosities. Receiving a less than lukewarm reception on arrival, Wolf is presented with a box containing his fathers papers. After being told in no uncertain terms that continuing his fathers work will not be tolerable, Wolf laughs off the notion. However, the next day he's out wandering in the ruins and comes across Ygor, his dead fathers assistant. Where it's revealed that \"The Monster\" is still alive but very much comatose. Wolf then becomes obsessed with bringing the monster back to full life, thus to prove his father had the right intention but not the right execution of his ideas.\r\n\r\nIt's a ripper of a sequel is this, perhaps lacking in the humour that James Whale brought to the first two films, it is however a well constructed feature boasting great performances from Rathbone (the part was originally planned for Peter Lorre), Lionel Atwill (having a riot with his false arm) and Lugosi (possibly a career high in terms of substance). Lee stamps his own marker on the piece and I think the nicest thing one can say is that his film sits well along side Whale's classics. The only let down is actually Karloff's monster, stripped of voice at Karloff's insistence, the monster is now reduced to being a lumbering robot. It's not a fitting farewell to the great work that Karloff did with this quite brilliant creation on page and screen. 8/10"

To be critical, for a moment, neither are really very good actors, or singers - but when pitched together they more than compensate with a generous dose of elegant chic!

I say later than expected because I bought the immaculate 24-film Humphrey Bogart Collection, which was supposed to have it on its 12 double-sided DVDs, but it accidentally had, in its place, the special features disc, which held excellent feature-length documentaries on both John Huston and the making of the film. Thus I waited until recently, when I found the blu for a very good price and went for it.\r\n\r\nIt was worth the wait. The ultimate tale of sordid greed. Without going into detail or spoilers, everyone got exactly what they deserved. My only qualm is that after a splendid cameo by the director (whom when I think of that aspect of his career, I will always fondly think of 'Chinatown'), I was hoping we'd end up seeing more of his character. That would have been even more wonderful for me.\r\n\r\nHopefully I will see and rate another 5,000--and I'm very curious if and when I do, what film I'll choose for THAT milestone..."

        "content": "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a film whose pleasures lie in the ‘how’ as opposed to the ‘what.’ Not long into the movie, Howard (Walter Huston) spells out the plot in broad strokes: “Never knew a prospector yet that died rich … going with a partner or two is dangerous. Murder's always lurkin' about. Partners accusin' each other of all sorts of crimes … as long as there's no find, the noble brotherhood will last, but when the piles of gold begin to grow, that's when the trouble starts.”\r\n\r\nThe movie then unfolds with all the inevitability of a Greek tragedy (with Howard doing Cassandra one better, because not even he heeds his own prediction). The story’s destination thus secured, writer/director John Huston doesn’t rush headlong for the finish line; on the contrary, he takes the time to establish the characters and the situation at his leisure, with lots of patience and a smattering of humor (including a scene where Bogie throws water in the face of an infant Robert Blake).\r\n\r\nAfter the three protagonists – Howard, Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart), and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) – climb up the titular mountains and Dobbs climbs down from sanity, everything goes pretty much according to Howard’s forecast – which is to say, spectacularly wrong, but spectacular nonetheless; Dobbs becomes paranoid and delusional, convinced that the other two are either going to stab him in the back or ambush him down the line – but never just shoot him on the spot, because they are “yellow.”\r\n\r\nEven at his most heroic, Bogie had an underlying mean streak; Rick Blaine is a cynical, bitter drunk who is, as one can only be in the movies, Saved by the Love of a Good Woman (even if he doesn’t Get the Girl in the End), and Sam Spade is always looking out for No. 1. It’s in films like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (see also Conflict, In a Lonely Place) that he lets loose that inner darkness which he only taps into elsewhere, and his descent into madness remains the best part of a great movie (and even then Huston finds room for humor, such as when Dobbs asks an interloper “who’s not civilized?!” right before sucker punching him)."

However, this is how this film begins, which presents us with a group of three Americans with no prospects for improving their lives who decide to invest everything in a treasure hunt by becoming gold prospectors in the most remote mountains of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe film continues with Americans surviving various hardships and revealing the worst of themselves due to gold fever, a type of greed that affects those who seek to get rich quickly by mining the most coveted metals in the world. There is no doubt that it is a very good film and that it treats the characters in a very careful way, with each one making a very interesting psychological and moral evolution. Therefore, it is perhaps one of the best works of the career of Humphrey Bogart, one of the most notable actors of the golden age of cinema. The way he worked on this film is impressive. Tim Holt is not far behind, however his character has a different evolution. Walter Huston also does a good job here.\r\n\r\nThe film is really worth it: the story is good, John Huston's direction is competent and effective, the black and white cinematography is very beautiful and elegant, the sets are well done, and the costumes also leave nothing to be desired. The film won three Oscars in 1949: Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (for Walter Huston) and Best Screenplay."

But as the story unfolds, Myra grows ever more close to the edge of insanity, could the still born death of the Savage's own child be the critical issue?\r\n\r\nSeance On A Wet Afternoon is something of a hidden/forgotten British treasure, not only because of the eerie atmospherics, but also because it contains a quite incredible acting performance from Kim Stanley as the troubled Myra Savage. Stanley was nominated for an Academy Award but lost out to Julie Andrews for Mary Poppins, I wonder just how many people even remember Stanley's film? \r\n\r\nThough chiefly marketed as a crime picture, this piece actually feels more like an offshoot of the horror genre, for it's a genuinely creepy picture that has unease lurking in every marvellous black and white corner. Boosted by an excellently understated turn from Richard Attenborough (also producer here) as Billy Savage, directed with exceptional skill from Bryan Forbes (Whistle Down the Wind), and with a plinking creepy score from maestro John Barry, this adaptation of Mark McShane's novel comes highly recommended for those that like a great psychological character study.\r\n\r\nOh and of course for those that know brilliant acting when they see it! 8/10"

This movie PERFECTLY recreated everything that those early B&W serials threw at those screaming kids sitting up in the movie theater balcony.

Sam J. Jones is the eponymous hero who, alongside the rather hapless Melody Anderson (\"Dale\") and Topol's slightly demented scientist (\"Zarkov\"), falls prey to the mischievous games of \"Ming the Merciless\" as he toys with the Earth. Once the intrepid trio arrive on \"Mongo\" they must fight for their very survival. In the case of \"Flash\", the poor fellow - who spends much of the film like a startled rabbit in the headlights - has to defend his virtue from the positively predatory \"Princess Aura\" (Ornella Muti) who's supposed to be betrothed to \"Barin\" (Timothy Dalton) who is, himself, constantly sparring with Brian Blessed's \"Vultan\" - king of the hawk-men. Add in the wonderfully creepy Peter Wyngarde as \"Klytus\" and Margiangela Melato as his villainous deputy \"Kala\" and we have the perfect ingredients for almost two hours of classic comic book action in the best tradition of \"thwack\" and \"pow\". The thing is 40 years old now - hence it's re-release on the big screen - and it doesn't look like any efforts have been made to improve on the original. The effects are therefore pretty ropey, the CGI as obvious as the delightfully cheap and cheerful costumes of the lizard-men and the munchkins who are dressed much like the playing cards from \"Alice in Wonderland\". Freddie Mercury and Queen provide a bit of added \"glamour\" to the proceedings with their title song and the eagle-eyed amongst us might just spot a 30 year old Robbie Coltrane in there too. Escapist nonsense? Sure - but it is still all good, uncomplicated, fun with it's tongue in it's cheek and just about everything else in leather, lycra and/or tights!"

He hypnotises her to rid her of pesky headaches, and give her the voice of an angel - and soon she becomes an international star of the opera. Robert Newton was originally slated for the lead, but I can't imagine he could have done better than Wolfit, who has the maniacal look (eyes, especially) and pithy dialogue down to a T. The support from Terence Morgan - as her much younger beau \"Billee Bagot\", Paul Rogers, David Kossoff and the truly wonderful singing of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf keep this entertaining enough, but the staging and style are just to limiting to let this version of a really menacing and evocative story soar."

The story centres around police officer \"O'Meara\" (Harrison Ford) who takes in an Irish lodger \"Devaney\" (Brad Pitt and his hilarious Irish accent). From the outset, we are aware that the lodger is really an IRA terrorist who is hiding out under an assumed name, and gradually his host begins to suspect that all is not what is seems. What now ensues is a really rather poorly constructed story that leaves breadcrumbs for us all to follow to an ending that though taut at times along the way, is really nothing very interesting. As a Brit, I've always found these intrigue films that portray terrorists as glorified freedom fighters a bit tough to stomach and the narrative here plays to just about every dumb stereotype imaginable. There is precious little by way of action and the pace sort of lumbers along with little to engage the little grey cells. The plot is overly simplistic and from a political perspective, totally one-sided and that renders the whole thing little better than an hollow outing for both. Though Pitt is at his most eye-catching, this is nothing at all to write home about and offers us little of meaning to help comprehend the complexities of the true problems on the island of Ireland."

When a gruff gangster (Lionel Stander) shows up on their doorstep havoc ensues. Iain Quarrier, William Franklyn and a young Jacqueline Bisset show up for peripheral parts.\r\n\r\n\"Cul-de-Sac\" (1966) is one of Roman Polanski's early experiments, a freestyle B&W psychological crime dramedy that takes elements of “The Damned” (1963), “Touch of Evil” (1958) and “A Streetcar Named Desire” (1951) and mixes them with black humor and the theme of the later “Straw Dogs” (1971). Jack Nicholson cited it as his favorite film, which makes sense when you consider Nicholson’s “The Shooting” (1966). In tone, it’s the precursor to Altman flicks like “The Long Goodbye” (1973).\r\n\r\nThere’s such an improvisational feel that one wonders what the point is? French girls are neurotic and promiscuous: British artists are wussies? Those who live by the gun will die by the gun? No matter how much a person tries to escape the world to focus on fulfilling his/her art (whatever that might be), the corruption of the world will come knocking on your door and might even share your bed? That even a finely cultured man will resort to his primordial nature if backed into a corner? \r\n\r\nThe film obviously has its partisans, who deem it a masterpiece. There are some interesting technical things going on, like the 7.5 minute scene on the beach, which was one of the longest continuous sequences in cinema up to that point. But the characters are oddball and unlikable while the story is meandering and dramatically dull. Yet the locations, the cast and the themes are to die for, not to mention the eccentricities.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot at Holy Island of Lindisfarne, off the coast of northeastern England.\r\n\r\nGRADE B-/C+"

With an all-star cast, including Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Houston, Louis Hayward, and Roland Young, and directed by Rene Clair, you’d think you were in for one of the all-time great mystery thrillers of the ‘40’s. Especially considering the material it came from: Christie’s expertly-written, suspenseful, and at times downright frightening novel is a great read that I highly recommend to anyone whose nerves can handle it. It’s one of the greatest stories of human corruption and brutality, of heinous crimes committed by a twisted mind, ever written.\r\n\r\nBottom line: the film is a bleak and utter disappointment.\r\n\r\nI then found out that the movie was actually based upon the stage play version, also written by Agatha Christie in 1943, four years after the publication of the novel. She rewrote the ending, reportedly feeling that the original ending would be too depressing for wartime audiences…making the very title no longer applicable! Instead of the dark and bloody climax of the novel, she went in for a “happily ever after” love story.\r\n\r\nMiss Christie, what were you thinking?!\r\n\r\nIf the production had been adapted from the novel instead, perhaps it could have been a good, worthwhile film. Although, the movie was also made during wartime; hence the usage of the alternate, rather than the original, ending.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the film never reaches the level of shock and suspense that is inherent in the novel. The only positive thing I can say is that the cast was competent, and Walter Huston definitely stood out.\r\n\r\nOverall, you’d be better off reading the real And Then There Were None. In the film, there were too many left."

A great ensemble cast are invited to weekend on a remote island by a couple they have never met. Once on the island, their host - by way of a record - accuses each of them of committing heinous crimes; then slowly - but surely - they start to drop like flies. I suppose I have to warn that in the vernacular of the 2020s, this film contains language and terminology that we might find offensive nowadays, but suspend the correctness for 100 minutes and you'll get a great murder mystery featuring a super cast - especially Barry Fitzgerald (\"Judge Quincannon\"); Louis Hayward (\"Lombard\") and June Duprez (\"Vera\") ; as well as some classy contributions from Judith Anderson and Sir C. Aubrey Smith and some clever staging/dialogue with a genuinely good \"whodunit\" ending with a twist. As with a few Christie stories, it's quite plausible that anyone did it and on stage it wasn't always the same character behind the plotting - so don't assume you will know who is the cunning brain behind it all if you've seen any other iterations."

It stars Edward Fox, Michael Lonsdale, Terence Alexander, Michel Auclair, Alan Badel, Tony Britton and Denis Carey. Music is by Georges Delerue and cinematography by Jean Tournier.\r\n\r\nAs the French political climate reaches boiling point over the Algeria situation, underground organisation the OAS plot to have President Charles de Gaulle assassinated. When an attempt fails the OAS members not caught are exiled in Vienna and decide that bringing in an outsider to kill the President is now the best way forward. That outsider is an Englishman, code name The Jackal, a methodically cunning and deadly assassin.\r\n\r\nWonderful, the kind of character driven thriller that has become in short supply over the last couple of decades. It’s all so simple, even sedate, yet this calm approach serves the plotting perfectly. After the initial set ups we follow The Jackal (a super icy turn by Fox) on his mission to kill General de Gaul. His planning, the people he meets, and the people he has to kill to stay one step ahead of the authorities. From cons to weapon smuggling, to disguises and sexual encounters, it’s thoroughly compelling from Jackal’s story arc alone, but the frequent shifts to the hunt for him by a whole ream of suits and detectives is also gripping and suspenseful viewing.\r\n\r\nBacking Fox up is a raft quality performers, a cast very much in tune with the material to hand. Delure’s musical composition is purposely of the minimalist breed, Tournier’s photography is period compliant and smooth, while Ralph Kemplen’s excellent editing was rightly nominated for an Academy Award. Zinnerman does sterling work from the director’s chair, amazingly keeping a two and half hour movie free of extraneous scenes or pointless exposition. Everything is relative, it really is a film to stay focussed with, to give it respect by giving it your undivided attention. So go the bathroom before sitting down to view this truly great and smart thriller. 9/10 "

Rebecca De Mornay is \"Haines\", an ambitious lawyer who is drafted in to defend \"Greenhill\" - a rather unpleasant fellow accused of killing his wife. What now follows is a particularly sterile court room drama as first he plays her before she cottons on and decides that the worm needs to turn a bit. The whole thing is entirely predictable with none of the jeopardy of, say, \"Jagged Edge\" (1985) nor does Sidney Lumet really make much effort with the characterisations - they are shallow, malevolent and not in any way did they manage to hook me or keep me engaged for what seemed like an eternity of extremely obvious faux plot twists. The ending is fitting, but I could have been doing with it about half an hour earlier! Another film for the telly, after a few drinks."

It stars Victor Mature, Guy Madison, Robert Preston, James Whitmore and Anne Bancroft. Music is by Leigh Harline and cinematography by William Mellor.\r\n\r\nWhen Chief Red Cloud (Manuel Dondé) - who has had enough of the army's incursions onto his land - evicts three mountain men from the region. Led by untamed Jed Cooper (Mature), the men head to Fort Shallan and take employment as army scouts...\r\n\r\nBy the time that The Last Frontier appeared on the great Anthony Mann's CV, he had established himself considerably in film noir and Western movie circles. Here he manages to get the best of both worlds incorporated to provide an interesting and entertaining piece. \r\n\r\nFilmed on location at Puebla, Mexico, with the Popocatépetl Volcano providing a beautiful and imposing backdrop, the hiring of Mellor is astute, ensuring the CinemaScope/Technicolor aspects boom from the screen. However, it's not just the beauty that demands to be observed, but also the ruggedness - cum - wildness, to which all things that marry up perfectly to the thematic and allegorical beats pulsing away in the story. Of course, nobody who loves Mann's Western work will be surprised by this.\r\n\r\nIt's a little disappointing that this ultimately isn't a grandiose adventure epic, because all the elements are in place for such, but action exists - with the final battle against Red Cloud's hordes - particularly exciting, but the emotional turmoil, repressed passions and army insanity that resides within Fort Shallan, more than compensates via characterisation weight. Mann throws in some tricksy camera work and neat framing shots to keep the visual experience still further away from the mundane, while Harline provides a compliant and non intrusive musical score.\r\n\r\nCast are doing dandy work. Mature turns in one of his best, blending macho strains with confused sadness, Whitmore is a reassuring presence by being believable, and Preston overcomes his usual woodenness to breathe life into his perf as martinet Colonol Marston. Bonus, and taking the acting honours is Madison, who as Captain Riordan never over does things, ensuring his fulcrum character is the glue holding all together. Bancroft looks wildly out of place, her look and the costuming most strange, yet it's testament to her ability that her key character is no token female role, nailing it without histrionics.\r\n\r\nThe ending, sadly, is rubbish, completely at odds with all before it, so it's no surprise to find that it was studio imposed and against Mann's wishes (vision). Still, forgive them for they know not what they do eh... 7/10"

It is a film about conscious existence and subconscious being, a film about love, a film about death, and the art and emotion expanding in between the longing sonder and emptiness. Synecdoche, New York is sonder as meta-cinematic expression. Life for everyone in their individualistic existence is simply their own syncretic vision of fleeting hope hurling towards inevitable death, and that’s perfectly ok, it’s just how things are. We all live in our own fiction unbeknownst to other’s fictions, so what truly matters is the genuine emotion we individually find and connect with through it all. \r\n\r\nEmotion is the only reality humanity is capable of grasping, and we must accept and learn to appreciate and live with that fact before it’s too late and our life has passed us by. Much alike an aspect of the film, where we constantly experience time leaps multiple years into the future without preparation or warning. A reflection of the fleeting nature of existence and how we can experience the transience of time before it’s too late, and the post-humous regret we will feel as a result of our ignorance to emotion and the inevitability of being. This isn’t a hopeless or nihilistic film, in fact, it’s quite the opposite. \r\n\r\n\"Sonder — noun. (neologism) the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own.\"\r\nTrying to analytically determine whether events in the film 'really happened' or not, or taking anything in this film as a literal matter of reality, is completely and utterly fruitless, and I believe goes completely against what the movie stands for. The film is intentionally crafted to defy such an undeviating analysis. It all happened, within a film! It is very much about why we make anything, why our individuality is significant. What do we hope to accomplish by creating or feeling something? How can you make anything about life if you are at that very moment?\r\n\r\nIt's a feedback loop: everything is a synecdoche; part of a greater whole.\r\n\r\nThe reality of the film is fictional because the film is aware that itself is fiction. It suggests that in some sense, every work ever made, no matter how true to life, is inescapably fiction, and that fiction is in some ways even more true to life than reality itself. We all live in our own fictional worlds, and when we task others to create or give emotion to our world, it can create a mirrored chamber of tunnel vision, a feedback loop. Caden gets lost in the mirror chamber, and the entire being of the film itself is an extension of that mirror. A masterclass of existential meta-cinema. \r\n\r\nThere are so many different subplots and aspects of this film that I could literally write a master’s thesis on it, but instead, I rather just chose to focus on the things most impactful to me in this little writeup. I could go on and on overanalyzing everything, but I think that would be counterintuitive towards the movie. This absolute masterpiece sparked lots of laughing, crying, and every emotion in between. It does what it is designed to do, force you into a metaphysical existential crisis. This is truly one of the most uniquely special films ever made, impactful in every single manner. One of the most principally powerful and important pieces of art EVER, I found myself sobbing even at parts that I didn’t even know what was going on. As the credits rolled I cried harder than I have in months, films like this are the reason I believe cinema to be the inherent soul of all artistic mediums, and the reason I find beauty in this chaotic existence. This film is going straight to my top 5 without a single fucking question or doubt in my mind. \r\n\r\nRest in peace, PSH. Your work continues to greatly impact millions of people, even after death. You are dearly cherished and missed. \r\n\r\nAnd thank you Charlie Kaufman, for completely transcending the medium, and creating one of the single most important films in the history of cinema."

What will we see? What will he show? I remember the general interest in this hitherto rather unsavoury topic was insatiable. Well, what we do get is a rather interesting and lively exposé of just how the porn industry might have worked in the late 1970s. Experienced producer \"Horner\" (Burt Reynolds) spots hunky waiter \"Eddie\" (Mark Wahlberg) in a restaurant and next thing, the young man is the hottest of properties. With the timeless moniker of \"Dirk Diggler\" (try finding that on PornHub!) he is soon a true star with money and girls and drugs galore. Fame is a fickle friend, however, and the writing is soon on the wall for our emotionally ill-equipped young man who never for a moment considers that this escalator can go down as well as up. This story is filled with engaging and enigmatic characters - ranging from the stoic \"Amber Waves\" (a cracking effort from Julianne Moore) who seems to try and instil a sense of proportion and responsibility to the gorgeously stereotypical \"Reed Rothschild\" (an unlikely casting, I thought, in John C. Reilly). It's Mark Wahlberg who proves to be the revelation here, though. He works quite naturally with the on-form, and entirely plausible, veteran Reynolds and for quite a while, their roller-coaster of sex and success is compelling and quite enjoyable to follow. Is anything real in that scene at the end? Well who knows - but 2½ hours peppered with some great disco just flew by in a cinema that was packed to the rafters."

        "content": "It's literally like someone took America by the East Coast and shook it, and all the normal girls managed to hang on.\r\n\r\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang is written and directed by Shane Black. It stars Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan. Music is by John Ottman and cinematography by Michael Barrett. \r\n\r\nSmall time thief Harry Lockhart (Downey Jr.) is running from the police and stumbles into a movie audition and gets the part! Partnered with private detective Gay Perry (Kilmer), who is to show him the ropes for the part he's to play, things turn just a little weird when dead bodies start turning up in his life \r\n\r\nShane Black's first venture into big feature film directing is a master class of genre bending bravado. The screenplay and script bare all the hallmarks of Black, where anyone familiar with his writing work previously will know where to set expectation levels as per barbed dialogue and blitzkrieg energy. Yet this is very much one of a kind, a standalone of such dizzying thrills and shameless awareness of movie conventions, it practically begs to be visited on more than one occasion. \r\n\r\nTo simplify it, it's a neo-noir  murder mystery  bromance  romance  comedy  actioner! OK, so not really that simple, then! Black takes a loving homage to pulp cinema and mixes it with caustic asides to the Los Angeles industry that provides him with work. How wonderful. Downey's (fabulous) Lockhart is the fulcrum, acting as antagonist, protagonist, narrator and a number of other things as Black runs him through the meta mangler. Kilmer (also fabulous) sidles up to deliver sarcasm, machismo and tongue in cheek posturing, the chemistry with Downey concrete. An odd couple pairing beautifully baring fruit, and, well, just beautiful really. \r\n\r\nInto the mix is the gorgeous Monaghan, who as Harry's childhood object of affection, is now a failed actress, slightly damaged, but strong and savvy, but also not, an unconditional femme fatale, but also not really! Corbin Bernsen (whose company produced the pic) files in for some joy filled has-been smarm, while sound tracking and photography sit comfortably with the nature of the beast. As a plot it's deliberately complex and convoluted, Black knows his noir onions, but he also wants to put his vibrant stamp on things, so he crowbars the comedy of The Hard Way into the hardboiled haze of The Big Sleep. And it works very well indeed. \r\n\r\nViolence is aplenty but very much irreverently played. Murders occur, either by design or otherwise, various body parts get assaulted and they shouldn't make for belly laughs, but they do; and not in some lame Weekend at Bernie's way either. And yet still Black has time to trickle sad themes below the surface, one in particular really hits home and forces the viewer to snap out of the frivolity for some reflection. Make no bones about it, these are damaged characters straight out of noir's dark alleyways in the 40s and 50s. So Capra meets Siodmak - Dmytryk - Mann - Tourneur - Wilder...then? \r\n\r\nSmarty pants film making makes for smart entertainment, see it more than once. Hell! See it annually in fact. 9/10"

Seriously, I would love this movie if you cut out all the f-bombs and nakedness.

Characters break the fourth wall several times throughout, keeping the movie comical and fresh.

The group is so well-received that they turn the head of eccentric rock producer Z-Man (John Lazar) who becomes their Svengali-style manager and changes their name to The Carrie Nations, all to the consternation of their small-time manager, who's a Greg Brady lookalike (David Gurian). Can the girls survive the pitfalls that come with the debauched rock lifestyle?\r\n\r\nDirected by Russ Meyer and scripted by none other than Roger Ebert, \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\" (1970) satirizes the previous melodrama from three years prior. The movie telegraphs right out of the gate that it's a joke and not to be taken seriously like the first film (at least, like they _TRIED_ to do with the first film). The cast is killer, highlighted by the three protagonists, especially the underrated Read. \r\n\r\nAlso worthy of note besides the key players cited above are Michael Blodgett, who's character takes an interest in the singer (Read); Phyllis Davis as her hip aunt; Edy Williams as an oversexed porn star; Erica Gavin who takes a dubious interest in Myers' character; Duncan McLeod as the aunt's sleazy & greedy financial adviser; Charles Napier as her former-beau; Henry Rowland as Z-Man's employee who (I guess) likes to dress-up as a Nazi; and Harrison Page & James Iglehart who vie for the attentions of the foxy drummer (McBroom).\r\n\r\nThe best thing about \"Beyond\" is that it's the absolute apogee of the late 60s (being shot in '69) and everything that went with it — the overindulgence in drugs, \"free\" sex, libertine parties, go-go dancing, rock and general debauchedness. There are several noteworthy women, with cutie Read the arguable frontrunner. Also, some of the tunes the band plays are actually catchy. All these factors make for a fun, entertaining flick, which explains how it quickly became a cult film.\r\n\r\nYet its quality is brought down by needless nudity and tame sex scenes that strapped it with a NC-17 rating, thus limiting its general appeal and access to the masses, which could've been easily avoided by wisely trimming down a few scenes. There's also too much fruity twaddle for my tastes and the \"story\" seems to be just one \"wild party\" after another, which gets redundant.\r\n\r\nStill, \"Beyond\" is the undeniable pinnacle of late 60's flicks, even though it can't be taken seriously for a moment, which is actually fitting.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

A lot of what makes this one so uneven is due to there being a lot to really like about it, a few points to love about it and then there were elements to utterly loathe about it. The film is at it's best with the way the mounting hysteria over the situation with them trapped within the supermarket and how the groups resolve their problems and start new ones which was pretty good and makes for a realistic feeling to the story, detailing how it all breaks down and what the group resorts to in order to keep their sanity. Likewise, that in turn leads into the films' best efforts in the first few attacks with the unknown creatures inside the mist killing off the victims as they refuse to believe what's out there and rush foolishly into the area which makes for a series of fun times out in the cargo hold and the different attempts to reach safety outside and then encountering the different creatures and their powers were all good points. The flying insects and them trying to keep them out as the different creatures break in resulting in a series of great encounters trying to clear them out of the store, and the insane battle in the pharmacy during the pitch-black interior is a rather stark and creepy experience fighting off the array of creatures that gives this one a ton of impressive points. The final few battles and escapes to get out, the blood and gore and the way that the creatures are dealt with are all loved points here as that all leads into the stellar finale which is an absolutely unforeseen and shocking in what goes on as there are some rather disturbing parts in this section. Along with the fine creature effects, these here are the good parts to really love about it although it does have a few issues to be had here. The film's biggest problem is the mere appearance of the religious babble that gets spewed in here which is so wrongheaded and rather off-putting it just makes the viewer feel like not watching it all that often. Yet another big issue here is the length and how overlong it feels, with the rather overlong sections in the middle really making it feel it's length somewhat. While there's plenty to like here, these do hold it back.\r\n\r\nRated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and intense themes of children-in-danger."

        "content": "You can't convince some people there's a fire even when their hair is burning. Denial is a powerful thing. \r\n\r\nThe Mist is directed by Frank Darabont and Darabont adapts the screenplay from the story of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Toby Jones, Laurie Holden and Andre Braugher. Music is by Mark Isham and cinematography by Rohn Schmidt.​\r\n​\r\nResidents of a small Maine town become trapped in the local supermarket when an otherworldly mist brings deadly creatures in full attack mode. That's not the only problem, for two groups form inside the market, one in favour of escaping, the other for expiation.\r\n\r\nAs is the norm, King adaptations vary in quality and divisive fan appraisals, so with \"The Mist\" on screen not exactly setting the box office alight, and it even getting delayed releases in Europe, one would think this is one of the lesser King adapted lights? Not so, in fact, it is now proving to have a longevity of worth in horror fan circles. So much so, that the great horror writer at the literary source gives it the full thumbs up whilst giving the \"changed\" ending his full pat on the back approval.\r\n\r\nDarabont is of course the director who previously took King's more human interest stories and crafted much beloved movies out of them, so why was he in the chair to direct a film about alien creatures unleashing bloody dread on small town Americana? Well actually the answer is why \"The Mist\" is such a cunning chilly delight. For this not only features monstrous creatures straight out of a Lovecraft/Barker nightmare, but also the monsters of the human kind, where the venality of the human condition is laid bare under duress, of which it is very frightening.\r\n\r\nThe alien creatures themselves creep the flesh, ok the effects work sometimes sags under the scrutiny of \"HD\" viewings, but this is nightmarish stuff, none more so than with a quite brilliant and terrifying sequence of events in a pharmacy. Yet it's the human monsters within the supermarket that usurps our creature invaders, where religious fervour and mans propensity for survival comes crashing together for dynamic results - the cast utterly in tune with the material and delivering quality portrayals.\r\n\r\nOnce the human battles within dissipates, and we come to the resolutions and reasonings of what has caused the creature invasion (hello subtext), we arrive at the much talked about finale. It actually deserves to be divisive, for we don't want yet another horror film finale that has people shrugging their respective shoulders and saying \"fair enough, but is that it?\".\r\n\r\nIf you buy into the all round bleak tonalities that the pic has been serving throughout, then this ending hits all the right buttons. For sure, this is no easy cop out to send you home with a smile on your face, it's brutal, and crucially it's befitting the word of the genre it sits in - horror. 8.5/10"

        "content": "The more I watch this movie, the more convinced I become that this movie is _less_ about the mist as a horrific result of military experiments gone awry, and _more_ a commentary on the fear of death and the unknown beyond.\r\n\r\nThe mist and its Lovecraftianesque creatures are symbolic of humanity's existential dread and the abject fear that there is quite possibly nothing else but this, and the end here is the end forever; or even worse, that what lies beyond is not a benevolent Creator, but rather an entity that either is indifferent to our existence and our plights, or is actively malevolent against us. Jean-Paul Sartre described this fear as \"existential nausea.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Carmody's ever growing religious cult was the very opposite extreme. She proclaimed to be a prophet of the one true God, yet was hypocritical, judgmental and quick to cast stones even in light of her own sins. Her fundamentalist extremism insured they _never_ escaped their box. But what seemed the logical end result of her many violent transgressions only served to martyr her in the eyes of other extremists -- as it so often does -- and serves, in their twisted minds, as vindication of what they've been preaching all along.\r\n\r\nAnd there are those who simply did the best they could with the circumstances they were given, but in the process, did not sacrifice the wills of others for their own gain while simultaneously giving of themselves unto the service of others. No one can say with absolute certainty what lies in wait beyond this life, but we shouldn't squander the moments we _do_ have on this Earth entombed in fear and letting that fear manipulate us into becoming the monsters we sometimes create ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe end of this movie has always been, in my opinion, the most tragic. The ending was _almost_ a happy one, if only they'd held out for a few moments longer. But in relation to the underlying theme laid out above, this group of people's break from the store to the car to the literal end of the road was metaphorical of venturing out into the unknown, even if it means leaving the comfort yet unstable illusion of safety and well-being, to take our chances navigating life the best we know how. We may feel as if ultimately the only thing we have any control over is when and how we die, but even this is just another illusion."

He is \"Garfield\" - a teacher who survived a vicious knife attack at his previous school in New York, but who is still determined to persevere and so moves to another in Los Angeles. The teenage kids there are a pretty disparate bunch, not really interested in education and certainly not interested in authority. Except, maybe, \"Rita\" (Karina Arroyave) who wants to succeed despite the pressures from her peers. From the outset, \"Garfield\" has a challenger in the young \"Cesar\" (Clifton Collins Jr) and most of the film is spent teeing up the ultimate denouement between the two men, in what is really a rather unfulfilling fashion. Kevin Reynolds provides us here with a pretty savage indictment of an education system that could hardly be more indifferent to the needs of it's staff or it's students. Indeed the state of the buildings, the safety of just about everyone and the attitudes of the students seems to be wrapped in a self-perpetuating film of neglect and fear of law suits. Jackson presents us with a measured performance, but his character is a bit sterile. The sub-plot with his fearful colleague \"Ellen\" (Kelly Rowan) tries to inject a little humanity, but even that cannot penetrate the otherwise dark, gloomy and bleak storyline that may well be based in truth (it was written by a schoolteacher) but makes for a curiously downbeat and unmemorable piece of drama."

Salvador is one such film, sometimes criminally forgotten, it remains to this day a searing tale of tension amongst the troubles of a Latin American hell hole. Boyle is right in amongst the implosion of a civil war, death squads and guerrillas from each side pull him from pillar to post as he tries to protect his Salvadorian girlfriend, while his friends and connections all are in peril purely for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\r\n\r\nSalvador triumphs mainly because Stone and his team have managed to capture all the building emotions of the main players, it's not just Boyle, it's the American government types, the press itself, and of course the crumbling Salvador people themselves, all things mold together in one big worrying pot boiler. James Woods plays Boyle and he is magnificent, managing to make an unlikeable character sympathetic, Woods (with Stone prompting for sure) clearly challenging himself to play out a career high. James Belushi also delivers his career best work, perfectly brusque and oblivious, his Dr Rock is the perfect foil for Woods' emotive Boyle. Then there is plaudits for Elpidia Carillo as Maria, charged with being the love interest amongst this carnage, she layers it perfectly for a very memorable performance.\r\n\r\nSalvador bizarrely is at times a humorous picture, but the laughs are all of the uneasy kind, because ultimately Stone's attempt at getting into the nitty-gritty of troubled El Salvador, is a harsh, and at times, a humbling experience. 9/10"

However, I do want to mention that the film dramatizes a few stories that should have gotten better coverage in the US.\r\n\r\nMoving on, though, this is not unlike Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas...if it went entirely dark and realistic. You have a journalist and his buddy in a Hawaiian T-Shirt not going to the glitz and glam of Vegas in search of the American Dream, but rather going to Central America in search of the American financed atrocities.\r\n\r\nAnd it is vaguely based on a true story and vaguely covers actual events from a dramatized perspective while asking the audience to be morally outraged at what they see...and it is horrific.\r\n\r\nBut when you really get here is WTC and Snowden on the other end, the movies following Alexander are Stone moving away from his cinematic hallmarks that made his films so great.\r\n\r\nSalvador, but contrast, is Stone moving towards his beloved tropes, you can see him developing his technique in Salvador, and that almost works as a build-up onto itself if you're a fan of Oliver Stone's movies.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic cuts, and the tidal waves of A and B list supporting characters are still a few movies away, but you have a solid development of what Stone movies will one day become, but you have it with a young Oliver Stone intensity.\r\n\r\nHe was working hard back then, and it shows in Salvador. Nothing about the film is phoned in and it works if you agree with his politics or not, as a dramatic war film of the highest grade.\r\n\r\nBut, don't take any of that into account if you are a film major... because what you have here is Stone, crafting a war movie, on a shoe string budget, and pulling it off brilliantly. That should be the lesson any film student walks away with. Forget what the movie was about for a moment, look at the final product and then look at what he had to work with."

It stars Burt Reynolds, Aldo Sambrell, Nicoletta Machiavelli, Tanya Lopert and Fernando Rey. Music is by Ennico Morricone and cinematograpy by Silvano Ippolitti. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThough Reynolds would say it’s the worst film he ever made, anyone who has followed his career will know that simply isn’t the case! It’s an odd Spaghetti Western that sees Reynolds play the title character, who strides out for revenge against the ragamuffin varmints who slaughtered his woman and tribe. Cue blood letting galore as Joe enacts said revenge with bloodthirsty glee as the hints of anti-racism struggle to show their heads above the pasta strewn pulpit.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNarratively there’s nothing else to add, it’s simplicity 101 and at times it becomes laborious. Where the film doesn’t lack for interest is with the technical aspects. Corbucci hones his skills as a purveyor of brutal set pieces, each striking for entertainment purpose. Ippolitti adds his own brand of cinematography, gracing the story with a pizzaz it doesn’t deserve, whilst Morricone provides a wonderfully catchy musical score. As for Reynolds? He does OK. Veering close to being pantomime and showing a lack of interest, his all round brooding charisma shines bright and gives the picture a macho edge.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNot a great film by any stretch of the imagination, the script is just too lazy, but it is above average and Spaghetti Western fans can find enough here to gorge on for a satisfying meal. 6/10"

The few hours they spend together become legendary after she chronicles the events.    \r\n\r\n“From Noon till Three” (1976) is an atypical Western that features a quirky air and comedic bits combined with some effective romance in the mold of the first half of “Bandolero” or “The Ballad of Cable Hogue,” but morphs into a parable about myth being more important than reality.\r\n\r\nIt’s better than “Goin’ South,” but not as entertaining as \"The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox,” keeping in mind that this isn’t an all-out comedy like the latter. It has the tone of, say, “There Was a Crooked Man...” As long as you don’t expect the awe of “Chino” or the grim action of \"Breakheart pass,\" it’s entertaining enough in its unique way. Jill is stunning and winsome as usual.\r\n\r\nThe moral doesn’t just apply to popular legends, like Jesse James, Wyatt Earp or Romeo & Juliet, but to the individual’s tendency to romanticize or bend the truth as years pass, making the person and occasion larger-than-life.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hours, 39 minutes, and was shot at Thousand Oaks, California, and nearby Warner Brothers Burbank Studios.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

I have an issue with Confederate Battle Flag, which was much more widely accepted when the series was first created vs this remake, but even ignoring that it's about moonshine runners getting away with horrible driving practices and whatever else they can get away with.  They're not good guys, they're just less bad, and maybe that's part of the appeal for some people.\r\n\r\nI went into this knowing that Johnny Knoxville (\"Jackass\") and Seann William Scott (\"American Pie\": Stifler) are both really funny, and at least Jessica Simpson is pretty, but she's not the Siren they present her to be, but comedy.  On the boys' side, you get pretty much what you would expect, but nothing surprisingly good.  Though there is a scene where they're pretty much thankful to be arrested because they're about to be killed for a \"black face\" joke.  I'll admit the context is pretty nuanced and well handled, but they also...could have just not done it.\r\n\r\nI'm stretching for good bits, and the best thing is probably the script.  The actual story of two average idiots trying to save their town from an evil capitalist they do is actually pretty good.  Imagine the \"evil oil baron\" bit from \"The Muppets\", but they're country boys.\r\n\r\nIt's not a complete waste, but it's definitely not a movie that I'd recommend or sit down to watch with someone."

Maltin, who also provides a commentary track for the film, muses on the importance of Hondo in light of the 50s tonal shift in the Western genre. A time when the Western cast off its one dimensional approach of cowboy/cavalry heroes slaughtering the enemy (Indians) purely as an entertainment medium. But is Hondo any good? And is it also worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Delmer Daves'-Broken Arrow (Maltin again) which ushered in the 50s with a bold and poignant crack of the whip? The answer to both questions possibly depends on how much you enjoy John Wayne movies in the first place. Here The Duke, playing a half bred Indian it should be noted, is wonderfully framed amongst the Camargo, Chihuahua (Mexico) location. The plot (starting off like Shane, released the same year) follows an interesting course, requiring Hondo to ultimately protect those he has fell in for, while simultaneously understanding his enemy since his blood contains the very same. Also of interest is that Hondo has very much become a solitary man of the wilderness, so when his emotions lean towards love and fatherly instincts, it makes for a nice bit of in character confliction. Something that Wayne delivers with much conviction.\r\n\r\nGeraldine Page was Oscar nominated for her role as Angie, and rightly so as well. Strong-willed and waiting out of loyalty for her thuggish husband Ed (Leo Gordon) to return to the family home. Angie herself is conflicted by her regard for the Apache and the stirrings brought about by Hondo's considerable masculine presence. Especially when a revelation later in the piece calls for her to decide her life course. All of which gives Page the license to feed off Wayne's presence, to which it provides great interplay that makes the film a potent and intriguing character piece. Stock players such as Ward Bond and James Arness aren't given much to do, and due to the film having originally being shot in 3D, the thrusts at the screen by various weapons are more quirky than impacting. But still, backed up by a fine score from Hugo Friedhofer and containing a rousing battle laden finale (apparently filmed by John Ford as director John Farrow had been called elsewhere), Hondo is a cinematic treat for like minded individuals. It's not as important as Maltin and many others would have us believe, but that doesn't stop it being an essential watch for fans of Wayne, Page and particularly those into Westerns in general. 7/10"

He is the eponymous army rider who happens on a remote ranch inhabited by \"Angie\" (Geraldine Page) and her young son \"Johnny\" (Lee Aaker) who appear to have been deserted by her husband. He knows that the local Mescalero Apache are disgruntled because the army have broken the truce, but cannot persuade them to leave their home. His visit to the nearby fort confirms his suspicions and after a deadly altercation with her husband on his way back to the ranch, he encounters the warring natives who - luckily for him - have taken the family under the protection of their chief \"Vittorio\" (Michael Pate). His death, however, changes that dynamic and now \"Hondo\" must reconcile his need to protect his new family with his decency towards the wronged Apache. It's short and sweet, this. There is plenty of action to keep it flowing along quickly and Page injects quite a bit of grit and determination into her character that is well complemented by a confident young Aaker. Ward Bond crops up now and again, but it's clearly just a vehicle for the star, and he does well enough."

Upon her return, the now much older \"David\" (William Holden) offers her a lift and though he doesn't recognise her, it is soon clear that she has lost none of her affections for him, and he now reciprocates. This throws a spanner in the works for the older brother \"Linus\" (Humphrey Bogart) who plans a large scale merger to make his bouncy glass, and that involves his brother marrying the daughter of the partner company. \"David\" is having none of this, but after he has an untimely accident involving his backside and some broken glass, \"Linus\" concocts a plan to send \"Sabrina\" back to France. This erstwhile steely man does not, however, factor in the effect his hanging out with this vibrant and intelligent young woman is going to have on him - and pretty soon he is just as smitten as his brother! John Williams adds value as her stiff upper lipped father; \"Waltons\" fans might recognise Ellen Corby in the role of his hyper-confident secretary \"Miss McCardle\" and Billy Wilder's script is entertaining and witty. There is a great chemistry on screen between the hugely charismatic Hepburn and Bogart and we do learn how not to make a soufflé omelette! Great fun."

DeMille's last ever directing assignment and he bows out with a gargantuan epic that to this day stands as a testament to his brilliant talent as one of the masters of epic film making.\r\n\r\nThe story cribs from a number of biblical sources, some of which are hokum and not to be taken as a religio lesson, but basically it tells the tale of Moses (Charlton Heston) and how he came to lead the Israelites to their exodus from Egypt - culminating in his delivering of God's own Ten Commandments to the people.\r\n\r\nNo expense is spared, with a top line ensemble cast being joined by over 25,000 extras. The wide-screen special effects work dazzles the eyes, the direction of ginormous crowd sequences impressive, and an ebullient spectacle is never far away in what is a picture running at three hours thirty minutes (add ten for the glory of an intermission).\r\n\r\nIt would have been easy for the cast to get lost amongst such a large scale production, but the principals shine bright and make telling characteristic marks. Heston was born for the Moses role, Yul Brynner absolutely excels as Moses' silky and sulky nemesis - Rameses, Anne Baxter gives Nefretiri a beauteous and villainous twin arc, which in turn is counterpointed by Yvonne De Carlo's sultry yet homely Sephora (wife of Moses).\r\n\r\nElsewhere we get Debra Paget filling out a trio of gorgeous lady stars, where as Lilia she does determined and heartfelt oomph as a woman yearning to be freed from male dominance. Edward G. Robinson (Dathan) and Vincent Price (Baka) camp it up and have a good time, while Cedric Hardwicke (Sethi) turns in a heartfelt old Pharaoh and John Derek as Joshua, Moses' underling, does surprisingly well given the enormity of the character trajectory.\r\n\r\nAs the music (Elmer Bernstein) swirls and thunders we are treated to Loyal Griggs' colour photography that pings out the screen and brings to life expert costuming. John Fulton's special effects work won him the Academy Award, and even though a couple look creaky these days, they all still today hold great entertaining spectacle worth. While the sheer gusto of the performances overcomes some less than stellar dialogue.\r\n\r\nLavish yet vulgar, hokey yet magnificent, this maty not be the greatest historical epic ever made, but it booms loud and proud and is an utter joy for like minded fans of the genre's output. 9/10"

Fox is a strong choice for the voice role of Chance, while Sally Field and Don Ameche are solid in their roles as Sassy and Shadow respectively.

Perched high on top of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the gunman has his pick of the targets, the Mayor -the President - or merely the innocent? Either way he has to be stopped before all hell breaks loose.\r\n\r\nMuch like \"Rollercoaster\" a year later, Two-Minute Warning is wrongly lumped in with the disaster movie genre that flooded the 1970s, and just like Rollercoaster, Two-Minute Warning is an excellently taut thriller. The build up is paced to precision, all characters are introduced to us to give us something to associate with should things go very wrong. As this is happening we get little POV snippets of our killer, accompanied by Charles Fox's harshly impacting music, the killer is never seen but we feel the dread, the impending sense of murder is a constant presence.\r\n\r\nOnce we are at the game and the authorities are aware that a sniper is on the roof, the film shifts up a gear and lays on the suspense thick and heavy. Captain Holly (Charlton Heston in authoritative scene commanding form) is joined by the SWAT team, led by the cool and serious Sgt. Chris Button (John Cassavetes), whilst stadium security manager Sam McKeever (Martin Balsam) prays that disaster can be averted. Then the final third of the picture is a ripper of heart pounding stuff, a final third that rewards the viewers patience for having invested in the film and the key characters. Filling out the cast is Gena Rowlands, Jack Klugman (brilliant interplay with Mitch Ryan's priest), Beau Bridges, Walter Pidgeon and David Jansen. \r\n\r\nTwo-Minute Warning is a quality thriller that is sadly undervalued on the big IMDb site, go on, give it a go and you might just be pleasantly surprised. 7.5/10\r\n\r\nFootnote: I should point out that my thoughts are on the original unedited cut of this film, I have never seen the watered down TV cut and have no plans to ever do so."

The plot was as simple back then as it is here and now. People receive a call from their own future self to their own cell containing the last few seconds of their deaths. \r\n\r\nThe only problem with this remake is, that the film makers had no idea what they were doing and in my opinion the material of original director Takashi Miike was pretty much raped and left for dead. Not only that this remake doesn't have the creepy feeling of the original \"Chakushin Ari\", even the characters have been \"white washed\". We have seen this already with the US remake of \"The Ring\", with the differenece that in that remake a lot of respect was shown towards the original movie \"Ringu\". Not so in \"One Missed Call\". The significant ringtone was changed to a dull and relaxed one, taking completely away that sharp and chilling aura surrounding these calls. On top director Eric Valette completely missed the point of \"One Missed Call\" being a franchise such as the already mentioned \"The Ring\" and also \"The Grudge\". Of all these franchises solely \"The Grudge\" was able to stick to the basic idea behind the Asian vengeful spirit, probably because original director Takashi Shimizu also took on the US remake. Yes, there were mostly non Asian characters in it and that was fine for the spirits in form of Kayako and Toshio kept their Japanese origin, making the 3 US remakes still relatable to the origin \"Yu-On\" franchise. \"The Ring\" already failed to do so by replacing Sadako with Samara, but at least it was a really good movie with a great atmosphere. \r\n\r\n\"One Missed Call\" was supposed to carry the tradition forth with Mimiko, but instead we got some random characters you don't even care about and the PG13 crime gives this remake its death blow. You loved the original especially for the extended bone breaking, limb twisting death scene in the film studio? Forget about that in this one. This here is made for children's eyes. Sure, the CGI ghost effects towards the end were somewhat charming, but it is just about as creepy as some effects presented in \"The Pirates Of The Carribean\" and such. The hugging scene of the mother with rotten flesh falling off her fouly body piece by piece? Not even included! The only correct similarity seems to be that in both films the little girl who later becomes the vengeful spirit died due to an Asthma attack ignored by the mother(s). But that's about it.  \r\n\r\nThis remake is shot nicely and also the leading actors Shannyn Sossamon and Edward Burns tried their best to carry the film, but when the film itself already lacks any form of vision and respect for its origin, it just ends up as being a pointless, soulless cash grab product with a few nice visuals. If your kids are 13 you can show this atrocity to them, but please... as soon as they are old enough, do them a favour and show them the real thing. To all the fans of the original: stay away from this one. It will only anger you and leave a very bad taste in your mouth... Or is that due to the red candy? You have been warned!"

For there are horror elements in the film, of which I don't wish to spoiler write about, the horror elements are there, they just aren't the boo jump scary monster variety that many had hoped for. The ending to the film disappoints many it would seem, but it doesn't to me because it is here that the film has most resonance and the point is well and truly made. It's acted out with style from the majority of the cast, and Shyamalan directs with a steady caring approach. It's not without flaws for sure, but this is a very tidy piece that's saying quite a bit if the viewer is so inclined to jump on board. All told, it's a very solid and thought provoking piece that's made with much film making care. 8/10"

Stories that focus on things larger than a single person as a \"character\" tend to lose people as they like to immerse themselves in a character and still feel they're bigger than the world in the setting.\r\n\r\nThe initial concept of a \"big bad wolf\" in the woods is interesting, but they do go a different way with it: they're almost a society of creatures the way they're given to behave where werewolves might have actually been a more effective choice for a \"monster\".\r\n\r\nLikely this has been spoiled for you, but if not, then you should definitely give it a shot, and if so, then you should see how it is for yourself."

        "content": "Good plot and haunting ambiance, but mediocre story and weak characters\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2006 and directed by Lucky McKee, \"The Woods\" chronicles events in 1965 New England when a troubled teen (Agnes Bruckner) is dropped off at a spooky remote boarding school for girls by her estranged parents (Bruce Campbell & Emma Campbell). Weird, witchy things ensue. Patricia Clarkson plays the dean while Lauren Birkell and Rachel Nichols play fellow students, one nice and the other mean.   \r\n\r\nThis is a mystery/horror flick that combines “Suspiria” (1977) with elements of “Carrie” (1976) and “The Ruins” (2008) or “Man-Thing” (2005) (yes, I realize “The Ruins” came out later; I’m just trying to give people an idea of what the movie’s like). The haunting atmosphere and the Montreal location are very good, as well as the unsettling creepiness. \r\n\r\nSo the plot is a winner, the film looks good and there’s an effective darkness, if that’s your thang. Unfortunately, the story is underwhelming. It’s too ambiguous and feels incomplete, like a half hour of events were cut from the runtime. The hints of levitation and telekinetic abilities don't amount to much, nor do the leaves on a bed.\r\n\r\nThe characters are either underdeveloped or unlikable, except for maybe the protagonist (Bruckner). All we know about Heather is that she recently set fire to something and there’s enmity between her and her self-absorbed mother. The father is a pushover. We don't learn much about them or anyone else at the academy. Marcy provokes pity while Samantha is too over-the-top as the villain. You’re more curious about WHY she’s so mean than anything else. With all the young females available, the filmmakers drop the ball by not taking advantage of these resources (and I’m not tawkin’ bout nudity or sleaze).   \r\n\r\nThe emotionless deliveries of the all-female faculty don’t help, but I realize they were written that way to create a sense of oddness and it works. The witchcraft elements are decidedly subdued, which I liked; the focus is on the formidableness of the forest itself (hence the title). Speaking of which, the woods F/X in the last act are well done. \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 31 minutes and was shot at McGill University, Montréal, Québec. WRITER: David Ross. \r\n\r\nGRADE: C"

While Dustin Hoffman seeks to find an antidote, the two generals in charge of the quarantine (Morgan Freeman & Donald Sutherland) strangely decide to annihilate the town. Can Hoffman find a cure in time? And, even if he does, can he stop the firebombing?\r\n\r\nWolfgang Petersen's \"Outbreak\" (1995) is an outstanding drama/thriller, which I suppose you could designate as a disaster flick. Although viruses are so small they're invisible, they have the potential to be the biggest monsters of all. Certain deadly viruses, if let loose, can wipe out an entire town in a couple days. This is the scenario in \"Outbreak.\" It COULD happen and is therefore realistic, which naturally makes the story more horrifying than most horror flicks or monster movies.\r\n\r\nBut \"Outbreak\" is more than just a scary what-if story, the second half involves a military cover-up and is edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, all the way to the final minutes. It's like an avalanche that slowly builds momentum.\r\n\r\nCuba Gooding Jr. is also on hand in a significant role as Hoffman's partner in the race-against-time. And, for those who care, there's a romantic subplot about Hoffman’s character and his ex-wife, played by Rene Russo. Will they get back together?\r\n\r\nThe locations are magnificent, filmed in the coastal towns Eureka, Arcata and Ferndale, California, all in the extreme Northern part of the state, just south of the Redwoods and West of Bigfoot territory (i.e. Willow Creek). The African sequences were shot in Hawaii.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: This is top-of-the-line cinema — equal parts scary, dramatic and suspenseful.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

Hoffman has to convince his boss - Morgan Freeman and his boss Donald Sutherland that he is up to the job and after a few false leads is soon on the trail of an African monkey that may hold the solution. Denied sufficient resource from the Army, he enlists the help of ex-wife (and expert in disease control Rene Russo) to help him grapple with his predicament.The story is tautly delivered with Sutherland rather good as the slightly unhinged general whose almost \"nuke 'em\" strategy leads for an uncomfortably strained relationship with the scientist. There is a smattering of plausible science and plenty of action - Cuba Gooding Jr. is his sort of \"Mr. T\" sidekick and Kevin Spacey and Patrick Dempsey add a bit of collateral too. Given the April 2020 Covid-19 situation, \"Outbreak\" has an added poignancy as to just how simply these things could occur!"

        "content": "Jean-Luc Godard's 1964 film <i>Bandè a part</i> (sometimes titled \"Band of Outsiders\") is an adaptation of a American crime novel that transcends its pulp origins through Godard's cinematic invention. The young lady Odile (Anna Karina), who isn't very bright, meets lowlife Franz (Sami Frey) in an English course and makes the mistake of telling him that the home in which she lives with her aunt holds a large amount of cash. Franz and fellow criminal Arthur (Claude Brasseur) plan a heist while at the same time vying for Odile's love, or at least her body. As is common in the French New Wave, the auteur only uses a crime caper as a skeleton for his own storytelling. A narrator (Godard himself) occasionally reads descriptive passages from the original novel, which are horribly purple prose, as if Godard is poking fun at his own source of inspiration.\r\n\r\n<i>Bandè a part</i> has occasionally been treated as a departure from this director's work, as \"Godard for people who don't like Godard\". However, anyone who has seen Godard's films to date will immediately recognize elements typical of his work at the time. For example, someone reads aloud a classic work of literature, this time an English teacher in a parody of modern language-learning methods. There is leftist social commentary, as the two criminals kill time by reading aloud tragic passages from Parisian newspapers. There is also dancing, as in the film's most famous scene Odile, Franz and Arthur interrupt their plotting for an amusing line dance in a café, over which the narrator tells us their unspoken thoughts.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is Godard's many references to the film canon. <i>Bandè a part</i> is deeply imbued with the spirit of American noir films, which fits with the crime caper plot, but it also nods to classic slapstick and romance, which gives it a levity and charm I wouldn't have expected from a film with these particular characters. <i>Bandè a part</i> may not be among the most awesome masterpieces of cinema, but it is memorable and funny, and very much worth seeing for fans of mid-century French films."

        "content": "As the 1960s went on Jean-Luc Godard kept up the kind of brash, zany, experimental style with which he made his name and became a cornerstone of the French New Wave, but his work increasingly showed a political consciousness sparked by the explosion of the consumer society in that decade. The class of haves, in his view, were being increasingly selfish and dog-eat-dog, while the have-nots of the world could not be expected to stand by idly. Society was surely headed for a breakdown, and his 1967 film WEEKEND is an absurdist vision of it in one hour and forty-five minutes. This is emphatically *not* a good entry point to Godard -- if you don't know his work, see Breathless or Le Mepris first -- but it is a marvelous capstone to his first decade of cinema. (After this, Godard disappeared from the limelight for some years while making more overtly political films with Jean-Pierre Gorin as the Dziga Vertov collective.)\r\n\r\nMarried couple Roland (Jean Yanne) and Corinne (Mireille Darc) set off from Paris one weekend for Corinne's parents' home, as her father is dying and they want to make sure they get their cut of inheritance. Not only is their relationship with Corinne's parents focused solely on money, but both Roland and Corinne are secretly having affairs and each plans to later dispose of the other in order to run away with their lovers. As Roland and Corinne hit the road, civilization appears to have vanished all around them: people are violently fighting each other over petty arguments, the road out of Paris is an endless traffic jam of honking horns and yelling, and the roadside is littered with car wrecks and their bloody victims.\r\n\r\nWEEKEND is a grand portrait of human veniality like Dante's INFERNO. Even when Corinne and Roland encounter a group of hippies, the idealistic dreamers who oppose the cruel order of capitalist society, they are shown great cruelty. Godard was awfully prescient: not only did he shoot this film a year before the events of May 1968 and he presaged a youth revolt, but he also expected that youth to perpetuate the same flaws of the system they overthrew.\r\n\r\nVisually, WEEKEND is as much a delight as any of Godard's other colour films of this time, with a pop art feel. Godard and his cinematographer Raoul Coutard had a great eye for colour, mainly the red, white, and blue from the French flag, but all the hues on screen are bold and electric. A great treat for film aficionados are several long tracking shots that required great skill to shoot, such as the long traffic jam. There's a lot of poetry in the shots: I don't know why, but a long take where a pianist plays a Mozart suite to a crowd of farmers in a barnyard and Anne Wiazemsky (in a non-speaking role) walks up to listen, is as emotionally moving to me as anything from Tarkovsky.\r\n\r\nBy this point Godard's films assume that the viewer is an intellectual, someone who has read a good bit of the literary canon and is aware of the political disputes not only of our time but also those reaching back to the 18th century. Thus as Corinne and Roland are wandering around lost around their own eventual car wreck, they come across the historical personage Saint-Just from the French Revolution (one of two amusing roles played here by the legendary Jean-Pierre Léaud), who absurdistly declaims from his writings while decked out in period costume. They then meet Tom Thumb and Emily Brontë. As the climax of the film approaches, two representatives of the Third World, African and Arab dustmen that our protagonists hitch a ride from, recite a revolutionary Marxist text at some length. And one scene where Corinne recounts a sexual encounter to her lover is a parody of Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA, which had come out the previous year.\r\n\r\nCriterion's re-release of WEEKEND on Blu-ray is a welcome event. The pop-art canvas of Godard's 1960s colour films comes through better in this higher-resolution format than on the old DVD releases. Criterion's extras are also enjoyable and informative. Viewers without a prior grounding in Godard's literary/political/social context will appreciate a 20-minute visual essay by Kent Jones which explains most of the references in the film, as well as some contemporary developments in Godard's life that aren't directly shown in the film, but made it what it is. There are interviews with the main actors from French television just before the film's 1968 release, and they explain how great it was to work with Godard, though one realizes that they hadn't seen the finished film and might well have been appalled at its anarchic pace and agitprop. The role of \"making of\" featurettes is provided by relatively recent interviews with cinematographer Raoul Coutard and assistant director Claude Miller."

Military plans for the killer beasties are the reason, but as we all know by now - nature finds a way, and after some dodgy DNA sequencing, they face an enemy that presents a terrifying hybrid of alien and human that could threaten Earth itself. It is up to her, whom the aliens still think is one of then, and a disparate bunch of space pirates to try to thwart the creatures - and to survive! This offers quite a shocking indictment of just how state-sponsored science, coupled with militaristic aspirations can lead to some hideous creations but aside from that rather obvious moral imperative, the rest of this is pretty routine.

        "content": "**Despite some merits and the effort of the director and cast, it is the weakest of the Alien films.**\r\n\r\nThis was the fourth film in the Alien franchise, and the last one for many years. The franchise started well and developed nicely into three films that, while not without criticism or problems, work really well and have a lot of coherence as a joint work. The fourth film, unfortunately, completely breaks with this coherent and harmonious union.\r\n\r\nJean Pierre Jeunet has done a pleasant and undoubtedly strong job. It is one of the films that made the director's career and that we remember when we talk about him. And there is no doubt that he managed to prevent this film from being even worse, putting great effort into his work, coordinating his technical team and guiding a strong and highly competent cast.\r\n\r\nSigourney Weaver is back with the character that launched her career, despite the very understandable reluctance to accept the project (after all, Ellen Ripley had died in the immediately preceding film). She herself stated, without any fuss, that she agreed to do the film because she was handsomely paid. I don't blame her. For an actor, who lives off the jobs he's called to, and who never quite knows when they'll appear, it's important to accept lucrative opportunities. And we have to be honest, the actress committed herself to the work and did everything to give us a performance at the same level as we have seen in previous films. However, she unfortunately did not have been material with the same quality. Winona Ryder, who was experiencing a particularly happy period in her career, is also here, and she also gives us a very reasonable job, although far from matching the great performances she achieved in other films of the same period. Ron Perlman, fairly unknown, is in good shape, as is Brad Dourif.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film is frankly inferior to its predecessors, and considering that all this is a set that should be cohesive and homogeneous, it is difficult not to make some comparisons. It's a film that continues to rest solidly on very strong visual and special effects, which are very reasonably done considering the age of the film and what has gone before it. It's not as spectacular as its predecessors, and any originality has been lost, but it's not bad, and it's worth seeing. Unfortunately, for a horror film with monsters on the loose, the action scenes are sparse, and seem very weak copies of what was done in the other films (to give an example, this film also has an alien sucked through a hole, in a very similar way to what happened in the first film). The tension and suspense are still present, and it's a truly unnerving film, which can be unsettling for some people. However, the really effective scares are few, even if it is a more visual and bloody film than its predecessors. An excellent cinematography helps to set this all up reasonably well.\r\n\r\nBetween merits and demerits, what really has no salvation is the script. The story we see in this film, in my opinion, not only has a very poor articulation with the films that preceded it, but actually ends up contradicting them. All it takes is to bring back to life, through a rather lame artifice, a character we saw to die with dignity. If this film needed Ellen Ripley – and indeed it needed, she was the character who gave the previous films its strength – the most logical thing was not to make a sequel, but a prequel or a spin-off with a story that was credible and logical, considering what was already done."

However, I think it never received the attention it deserved, perhaps due to the fact that it was released at a time when the fantasy genre was dominated by a group of other much stronger and more relevant films. The film also strives to show the hidden side of knowledge as something dangerous, less than desirable, following the logic of “there are things we simply shouldn’t know”.\r\n\r\nThe story begins when a recently divorced woman moves with her children to a rustic house in the forest, which belongs to a great-aunt hospitalized as crazy. This house has been closed for a long time, there is salt on all the windows and an industrial amount of tomato sauce and honey in the kitchen pantry. Intriguing. It is quite evident from the beginning that the brothers get along badly, and that the youngest is very attached to his father and waits for him to return. And it is precisely he who begins to hear noises that convince him that there is something more in the house. He discovers a book with a dark warning, but still decides to read it, finding himself in the power of a series of hidden knowledge that should never have reached him, and that were collected eighty years earlier by a great-uncle, who disappeared without a trace.\r\n\r\nLike I said, it's a good film and tells a good story. The characters are good, from the humans to the enchanted figures, and there's a lot of entertainment and creativity here. It didn't have a great reception in America, but it was a success in Europe and continues to appear on television from time to time. Directed by Mark Waters, who already has some experience in films for young people, but was far from being a name to consider from the outset, it has a good group of actors. Freddie Highmore shows talent and commitment, which opened many doors for him in the following years, and Irishwoman Sarah Bolger is not far behind. David Strathairn and Joan Plowright are the adult actors who deserve the most praise for their efforts here. Both were very good, and brought credible and adorably magical characters to life. Nick Nolte also makes a cameo appearance.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film relies heavily on high-quality CGI, great visual impact and scenic effect. There's no doubt that there was a lot of money invested in the visuals and cinematography, and it paid off: the film doesn't feel unrealistic or overly fanciful. The enchanted objects and characters seem realistic, worthy of the credit we want to give them. The colors are magnificent, the light is ideal, the studio filming was well done and the house where the film takes place is visually magnificent, worthy of a fairy tale. James Horner provides the soundtrack in an effective but not memorable way."

For some reason, God, or whoever you want, didn't want to make it possible for humans. This is the belief of the Paladins, who hunt down and kill the “Skippers”, individuals who can, in fact, travel between different places in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nThe film starts off with a very good premise and would have been a remarkable teen movie had it not been for the poor practical realization of it all. The film is beautiful, and the script is good, with a good story… but things just seem too imaginative, and the excessive use of CGI and green screen does not help to mitigate this feeling, quite the contrary.\r\n\r\nHayden Christiansen secures the protagonist with efficiency, not to mention talent. He doesn't have big similarities like what we saw in “Star Wars”, he manages to make us forget what we've already seen of him and give us something good here. Unfortunately, there's no one in the cast who can keep up! Of course, except for the veteran and impeccable Samuel L. Jackson, although his character is somewhat cliché, and the actor sometimes seems to limit himself to giving us a darker and colder view of “his” Nick Fury.\r\n\r\nDespite the weaknesses, the clichés and the fragility of some points and production values, it is not a difficult film to recommend: it really entertains its audience well and, for those who haven't seen it or don't know much about it, it can be truly a good surprise."

Is that in a stalker's handbook somewhere? \r\n\r\nAs the all mighty great and powerful Hollywood continued to mine \"Hitchcock's\" works for inspiration, they landed upon the idea of re-imaging \"Rear Window\" for a modern audience. Directed by D.J. Caruso, Disturbia actually turns out to be a solid suspense thriller. The first half of the pic is all jocular with hormonal character introductions that come with giggly slices of humour, and then there's the big shift to the thriller that most viewers were expecting, as the makers manage to pull it off with a great final act that is edge of the seat viewing.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing new on offer here, the formula has been (and will for ever more be) done a zillion times, but the two fold splicing of genres works well and the makers aren't trying to fool anyone with their approach work. Cast are fine, Shia LaBeouf's follows on from his enjoyable turn in \"Transformers\" with this pleasing on the eye show, he shows signs of some good acting chops around some rougher edges. Sarah Roemer is solid enough, and nails down that teen love interest characterisation, whilst Carrie-Anne Moss puts a bit of meat onto the adult bones of the Mother character.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in what is one of the key roles, David Morse is underused, he does OK with what he has to work with, and convinces in a two layer role, but one feels his talent doesn't quite come to the fore here. Still, it's a minor complaint, for this is a solid genre entry with both halves of the film never less than entertaining - even if you might find yourself yearning for some \"Hitchcock\" genius afterwards. 7/10"

There isn't really a script to speak of, and at 2½ hours this really does feel like you could have actually built one of the pyramids in the time it takes to come to what is the inevitable tee for another sequel. John Turturro steals his scenes as the ultra-hammy agent \"Simmons\" and we have Josh Duhamel as the eye-candy in an uniform but as with the first film, Fox is as wooden as a skateboard. Although there is pretty much non-stop action throughout, I still couldn't tell who is fighting with whom nor is \"Bumblebee\" getting any better at the close protection game.

I was thoroughly impressed with how delicately Miyazaki established this bond between the two children, their imagination, and the natural world. Totoro, the lovable silent giant, is a great and unexpected metaphor for the healing power of the natural world and childhood imagination :)"

On its maiden voyage, however, it vanished. Seven years later, it has returned, orbiting Neptune, and a rescue crew is sent out to investigate, along with the scientist responsible for the ship’s creation. The rescue crew of the Lewis and Clark are a group of no-nonsense blue-collar workers, led by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), with Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) along for his expertise. When they arrive at the Event Horizon, they find the crew long dead. “This ship is a tomb,” judges Captain Miller at one point. The rescue team begins to realize that the ship passed through a black hole created by the gravity drive, but didn’t return alone. The ship with a long-dead crew shows life signs. The rescue team begins to have terrifying visions. The gravity drive begins to spin of its own accord...\r\n\r\nSomething is loose on the ship, and the rescue team has to not only unravel out what happened to the original crew, but also protect themselves from the horrors that returned with the ship. It’s a simple but sturdy setup, standard B-movie stuff. What elevates Event Horizon is its first-class production design and solid atmosphere. Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, Alien vs. Predator) is not a name one would generally associate with good film product these days, but here he managed (in spite of himself, one may think given the rest of his output) to present a film steeped in suspense, with strong performances, gorgeous set pieces, and palpable horror.\r\n\r\nLet’s be honest: there’s nothing new here. The strength of this film lies in how it fits together the pieces it stole from other films. This is very much (and very completely) The Shining by way of Alien, even to the point of lifting the character archetypes directly from Ridley Scott’s 1979 masterpiece. The Event Horizon is the Overlook Hotel, teeming with supernatural power and malice. The film delves into gore in its last third, but it’s not quite proficient enough to have it enhance the scares (which were doing just fine before the blood started flowing so freely). However, the film is even structured like Alien and The Shining, all slow burn and building dread until things begin to go to hell (literally, perhaps). The cast have stock characters but they bring them to life admirably, particularly Neill and Fishburne; among the secondary characters, Kathleen Quinlan, Jack Noseworthy, and Sean Pertwee are particularly memorable. The script by Philip Eisner is derivative but effective, and Anderson was clearly at the peak of his directorial prowess here. Don't misunderstand me to say that the film's lifts from other works make it bad; it's certainly not. Originality is overrated as an attribute, and fairly value-neutral even on the best of days. I'd much rather have a tale well-told than one that does weird things simply for the sake of doing weird things (French sci-fi/fantasy directors, I'm looking at you. Yes, you, Jeunet), though the greatest films find a way to combine both sturdy storytelling and originality in the medium. In total, Event Horizon is a very effective sci-fi horror film, breaking no new ground but doing what it does very well. A minor classic of the sci-fi horror genre."

Music is by Michael Kamen and orbital and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle.  \r\n\r\n2047 and a group of astronauts are sent to investigate the 'Event Horizon' which disappeared mysteriously 7 years ago. It has returned minus its crew and now the crew of the 'Lewis and Clark' become exposed to horrifying secrets of the ghost ship...\r\n\r\nIt is what it is, a haunted house chiller set on a space ship. It's derivative within the genre but it does the genre staples with no little amount of quality. The tone is set from the opening credits being accompanied by a ferociously foreboding musical score, and from there the pic delivers a \"who is going to get killed and in what order\" process - and why? Just what is the mystery at the core of it all?.\r\n\r\nA great cast has been assembled, which lifts it above its \"B\" movie roots, so with some thoughtful ideas within the narrative, it's easy to buy into the characterisations. Naturally the blood will flow, devilishly so, but the makers here put a different slant on the sci-fi/horror assailant thread. Of course it gets a bit by the numbers come the final quarter, arguably a bit hokey in fact, but it's very effective and perfect for a lights off viewing experience.\r\n\r\nSmart production design helps keeps up the chilly feel to proceedings, whilst the bleak tonal flows that director Anderson goes for really draws the engaged observer in. It's neither ground breaking or a top line film of its type, but holding up on repeat viewings it proves to be a sturdy and unsettling space based chiller. 7/10"

We are now presented with a creatively entertaining mix of sci-fi and light horror, with some good visual effects (especially the lighting) that complement, rather than overwhelm, the story. The acting - even from the usually stiff as a board Neill (and his creepy eyes) - makes for a well presented and exciting adventure that offers us menace, some decent dialogue and a genuine sense of peril as we edge nearer the quite uncertain denouement.

        "content": "**A duel of generations, a school, angry teenagers and lots of rock.**\r\n\r\nThis is a film for young adults that takes advantage of traditional teenage rebellion and the talent of Christian Slater, a good script and a good soundtrack. It's not masterful, but it's ideal for a Saturday afternoon and has aged very well: thirty years after it was made and marketed, it's still young and fresh.\r\n\r\nThe story focuses on a clandestine radio station created by an angry and angry teenager who was forced to move house and is in a place where he doesn't know anyone and doesn't even feel comfortable. The radio is an outlet, it is a means of expressing inner anger, and it is nothing truly serious, but it becomes increasingly relevant as it acquires a very loyal local audience, who listen to him as if he were a guru without even knowing it. his identity, and allows himself to be carried away by his words in a wave of riots and protests that are directed, in particular, against the management of the local high school.\r\n\r\nThe story is quite good, it is well written, and the duel between the two characters (the young teenager assumed to be the radio presenter and the plenipotentiary director of the school) mirrors not only the oldest conflict of generations but also the permanent conflict between powerful and weak in society. None of this is particularly new, but the way it is served and presented was creative and wonderfully entertaining. The problem here is that it's a film for teenagers, it's too light, and it lacks secondary characters that are at least as complete and impactful as the two central characters.\r\n\r\nChristian Slater lived in his youth, the happiest days of his career, and gave us good characters in good films. With time and success, he became a star and almost a synonym of rebellion and irreverence, an apprentice of James Dean who exploded onto the screen, guaranteeing the success of his films and the influx of young people to the cinema. Time, however, would show that Slater was, in each film, playing a single character, which was the one he tried to revive in his personal life, increasingly complicated by addictions and problems with the authorities. Annie Ross, on the other hand, gives us mature, well-developed work, suitably dark and dense, never allowing Slater to feel alone in the spotlight.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, it is in the soundtrack that we find the film's strong point. The songs include hit songs by Leonard Cohen, Pixies, Ivan Neville and Cowboy Junkies, and most of them are very easy to know for anyone who lived through the 90s and 2000s, that is, everyone or almost everyone. The rest doesn't really matter: with no mistakes to regret, it doesn't exceed the average at any particular point."

Gary Oldman plays the heartless Warden (technically associate Warden) while R. Lee Ermey is on hand as the judge.  \r\n\r\n\"Murder in the First\" (1995) is a prison/courtroom drama that says its “inspired by true events,” which means it’s NOT a biography of the real Henri Young, but rather uses Young’s basic story as a microcosm for unveiling several of Alcatraz’ dubious and inhumane doings during the 30s. Look up the real history after viewing the movie, yet not just Young’s story and the trial, but also the ‘Dungeon’ and how prisoners were treated in solitary confinement during the early years of that infamous ‘Rock.’\r\n\r\nThe movie successfully brings the viewer back to the 30s and early 40s, but the filmmakers laid it on too thick in regards to how ee-vil the prison authorities are, not to mention how supposedly innocent Young is (he wasn't), which smacks of agenda. But, like I said, Young _represented_ several issues/cases at Alcatraz, so it can be overlooked.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is cut from the same cloth as “The Shawshank Redemption,” the surprise hit from a year earlier (not that it was a hit at first, but it eventually became one). I’m not saying “Murder in the First” is as good but, if you liked “Shawshank,” you’ll probably appreciate it.\r\n\r\nEmbeth Davidtz, Kyra Sedgwick and Mia Kirshner show up on the feminine front. Davidtz really shines in the biggest role of the three.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in San Francisco & Alcatraz Island with the courtroom scenes done at Triscenic Production Services Inc. in Los Angeles area. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

He goes on to become a minor celebrity as people leave gifts for him for his \"heroic deed\", not the least of which is a piglet that he names Bill. Máiquel gains a girlfriend in Cledir (Cláudia Abreu) and an admirer/patron in Dr. Carvalho (Jorge Dória), a dentist. The hero's life becomes more complicated when Suel's very young girlfriend Érica (Natália Lage) insists that Máiquel give her a place to stay since he killed her boyfriend, and Dr. Carvalho enlists him to take out the man who allegedly raped his daughter.\r\n\r\nThis movie is at its strongest when it's setting up the pieces on the board. We wonder where Máiquel's life is headed as no one seems terribly bothered by his taking a human life. His becoming a killer for hire seems only to result in reward with no downside. Máiquel appears to understand that murder is wrong, but it's not something that keeps him up at night. Rather, he's more concerned about whether or not to marry Cledir who has become pregnant with his child and getting himself an above-board job.\r\n\r\nIt's only when Máiquel becomes a successful hitman and gets his friends to help out that he begins to suffer setbacks. One of those involves Érica finding religion either because she feels guilty for being with a killer or because she doesn't get enough attention or perhaps both. The appearance of religion in this movie attempts to show how corrupted Máiquel has become as he resorts to violence to deal with a pastor. Máiquel also has trouble with the law when police from outside his area start to investigate his friends.\r\n\r\nThe challenges Máiquel faces in the latter part of the film are nowhere near as interesting as his entry into the world of murder. The surreal responses he receives to the killing of Suel give the story momentum as we wonder what's going to happen next in this bizarro world and if Máiquel will ever see justice for murdering a man. The issues he faces as he scales the social ladder are more typical of a crime drama and don't feel as fresh the film's setup.\r\n\r\nThe third act is particularly troublesome since Máiquel essentially blames others for his problems and sets out to \"right wrongs\" in the only way he knows how. Máiquel seems to have no awareness of what he's become or his own culpability, making the ending rather problematic. Needless to say, _O Homem do Ano_ is not the type of movie you want to show to someone impressionable because it's very easy to take away the wrong lessons from it."

There's quite a decent list of songs to keep it moving - \"Bugsy Malone\", \"Down and Out\" and \"So You Wanna be a Boxer\". Not songs you might recognise by their titles, but ones your toes start instinctively tapping to when the ensemble break into their well choreographed delivery. It's an OK watch, this, but I found that the initially innovative joke wore a bit thin quite quickly and the scenarios prove just a little too repetitive. That said, Foster and Baio work quite well together and it does look good - sending up all things Al Capone! Worth a watch, but nothing great."

It stars Denzel Washington, Tom Sizemore, Jennifer Beals, Don Cheadle and Maury Chaykin. Music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Tak Fujimoto.\r\n\r\nCarl Franklin had already laid down a considerable neo-noir marker with his searing 1992 thriller One False Move, here he goes more traditional but garners equally impressive results. Plot has Washington as a WW2 veteran who has lost his job and desperately needs money to keep hold of his pride and joy - his house. Taking on a job offered by shifty DeWitt Albright (Sizemore), to find a missing woman, Rawlings quickly finds himself in up to his neck in murder and deception, he must turn ace detective to save his skin.\r\n\r\nSet in late 1940s Los Angeles, what instantly stands out is the period detail. The clothes, the cars and the establishments frequented by Easy and company. With voice over narration also provided by Washington, in dry and sardonic tones, it's every inch a loving ode to the film noir movies released at the time the pic is set. There's plenty of neon signs about the place, some bad ass cops, good sex, brandy and sharp suits, smoking and coolness and of course a psychopath in the classic mould (Cheadle excellent).\r\n\r\nBut of course noir dressage is only that if you haven't got a good pot boiling plot, thankfully this has one. The story takes unexpected turns, always remaining interesting, the distinctive characterisations breathing heavy, managing to off set the run of the mill stereotypes in the supporting ranks. It can be argued that Beals as the titular femme fatale of the title is under written, but the character comes with an air of mystery that serves Franklin's atmosphere very well. Tech credits are high, something of a given with Bernstein and Fujimoto on the list, while Washington turns in another classy show of subtlety and believability.\r\n\r\nLovers of film noir should get much rewards from Devil in a Blue Dress. 7.5/10"

Richard Donner had completed about three quarters of the film before being taken off the project, so Richard Lester then came in to finish the film. Because of the back stage problems there are a host of writers credited on the film and both Robert Paynter & Geoffrey Unsworth were involved with the cinematography. Filmed using the Megasound system the score is a reworking of John Williams original score by Ken Thorne.\r\n\r\nSomething of a miracle in itself that Superman II, in spite of all the behind the scenes shenanigans, is a very fine sequel to the massively successful Superman from 78. Sure there's some odd tonal shifts, a couple of things don't quite add up (to be corrected later on down the line with the release of the Richard Donner cut), while the villains are badly under written, but this has enough comic book adaptation savvy to please most comic book lovers.\r\n\r\nThis time around sees Superman pitted against three villains who have been released from their prison due to Superman himself detonating a hydrogen bomb in space. The big kicker here being that the three convicts, General Zod, Ursa and  Non, are from his home planet of Krypton and had been imprisoned by his father Jor-El. Now they are free they are hell bent on revenge against the son of Jor-El and the planet that worships him.

Susannah York plays Kal-El’s mother while Jackie Cooper is on hand as Perry White.\r\n\r\n\"Superman II\" (1980) was mostly shot simultaneously with the first film in 1977 wherein director Richard Donner had shot 75% of the film before focusing on finishing the first movie. When the flick went back into production in 1978 Donner was controversially fired and replaced with Richard Lester, who was already working on the project with Donner as second unit director. Marlon Brando’s scenes as Jor-El were cut (obviously because he wanted too much money, i.e. 11.75% of gross US box office earnings) and redone with Lara (York). \r\n\r\nDespite the behind-the-scenes drama, this is a thoroughly entertaining sequel with some people even claiming it’s better. What makes the film work so well is that (1) the three Kryptonian villains are interesting and their superhuman exploits are engaging, (2) Luthor is likewise amusing, (3) the sci-fi ambiance and special effects are state-of-the-art for the late 70s and (4) the drama involving Clark/Supes and Lois (and Perry White) is consistently entertaining. On the downside, I could do without Otis’ goofy antics (Ned Beatty) and the movie is slightly overlong. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes and was shot in Paris; Norway; Niagara Falls & Calgary, Canada; Pinewood Studios (the Metropolis scenes, etc.), Chobham Common, Surrey (the East Houston, Idaho, scenes), & London Underground, England; and St Lucia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A/A-"

        "content": "If you enjoy reading my reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is (obviously) a SPOILER review. I mean, who hasn’t seen this movie yet? If by some extraordinary circumstances you’re one of those unlucky souls, stop. Spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here. I will still avoid mentioning key details because I’m just used to it, and The Lion King has so many things to compliment that I don’t really need to get in-depth on spoilers. So, in case you haven’t notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)!\r\n\r\nI rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That’s how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can’t simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia’s tears. Mufasa’s tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole “remember who you are” speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer‘s score, leaving me absolutely destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It’s one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an “okay” scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a “good” movie turn into a “great” one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn’t that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments.\r\n\r\nDuring the stampede sequence, the score doesn’t lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It’s that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it’s solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba’s roar … Damn it, I’m crying again!\r\n\r\nThe animation is some of Disney’s best. It’s not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone’s childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There’s no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they’re feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone’s wallpaper even today.\r\n\r\nThe songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, … Every single song is someone’s favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career’s biggest role, Darth Vader isn’t the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character’s voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who’s the “bad guy”, and that’s unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It’s true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba’s journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it’s a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can’t just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are.\r\n\r\nIt’s a masterpiece! It doesn’t matter if it’s an animated film. It doesn’t matter if it was “made for kids”. People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it’s undeniably one of Disney’s best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs … The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its “live-action” remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again.\r\n\r\nRating: A+"

        "content": "Certainly not one of Disney's better animations from a technical perspective - the artwork lacks the vibrancy and detail of many of their earlier stories; but the combined efforts of Sir Tim Rice, Elton John and Hans Zimmer make this an enjoyable fantasy adventure. It is told in two parts - the first sees a son \"Simba\" born to the king \"Mufasa\"; a curious little fella who, alongside his friend \"Nala\" is inquisitive and mischievous - a real pain in the neck to the king's major-domo \"Zazu\". One fan the new cub really doesn't have, however, is the king's rather unimpressed brother \"Scar\" who hatches a plan to depose his brother and take over the kingdom. He manages to achieve exactly this and to get the youngster to blame himself and head off, alone, into exile. The second part is much more fun; he falls in with a warthog and is soon eating colourful grubs and living a peaceful, jolly life far from home. That idyllic existence is not to last long, however - \"Nala\" discovers he is still alive and races to alert him of the disaster that has befallen the kingdom under the rule of his uncle and his trusty band of hyenas. The musical numbers help it build to a gripping denouement, with clever, quite witty dialogue from some good - though not great - voice talents from the likes of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg to keep the pot boiling. It is an enjoyable film to watch but I wasn't captivated by it."

        "content": "For England, for home, and for the prize!  \r\n\r\nMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World is directed by Peter Weir, it stars Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany as Stephen Maturin. It is spliced from various novels in the Aubrey–Maturin series written by Patrick O'Brian. The film takes place during 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars and finds Captain Jack Aubrey and the crew of British frigate HMS Surprise ordered to intercept, destroy or take as a prize the French privateer Acheron. But the Acheron (The Phantom as the crew of the Surprise call her) is no ordinary ship, and her Captain is smart. So Lucky Jack has his work cut out; not only in the pursuit of the Acheron, but in harmonising the crew under his command. Especially his loyal and trusting friend Stephen.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty evident within the first few minutes of Master & Commander that this is no standard blockbusting naval based war movie. If you are after, or was expecting, a wave to wave Bruckheimer carnage a-like piece, well you best, or should have, stay(ed) away. For this is a Peter Weir movie, in fact this is a Peter Weir \"period\" movie, where attention to details and character dynamics are the order of the day. There's battle action here for sure, beginning and end, and terrific they are too, as first cannonballs crack and splinter their targets (note the sound work here), and later as blade meets blade - it's exhilarating stuff alright. However, this is more interested in palpable tension, both on deck and on the waves. Threat is never far away, again, this is is covered by the impending duel with the Acheron and Aubrey's tactical pursuit/escape of her. As the Aubrey machinations unfurl, the crew give us a series of character dramas to involve us in the make up of a man-o-war's personnel. How different classes and males (there's not one female in the film) of all ages have to work together as one efficient unit in order to survive and triumph. Except for an interlude spent on the lusciously filmed Galapagos Island (Russell Boyd Best Cinematography Academy Award Winner), the film is set 99% of the time out at sea, on a cramped ship, this tells you that Weir is interested in telling a character driven story, one that is cloaked in realism above all else.\r\n\r\nThe teaming of Weir with the highly rated O'Brian material looked a good one, and to someone like me who has never read an O'Brian novel, it is. Unsurprisingly many of O'Brian's fans have been upset by either the stuff missing in the film, the stuff put in to fully form Weir's vision of the characters, or for Crowe not being Pugwashy enough. These complaints were inevitable since they come with practically every adaptation of novels these days. It should be noted, though, that Weir was very much a fan of O'Brian, and in fact always felt inspired by the tight intricate detail of his writings. What of the author himself? Well he passed away three years before the film was released, but he had always envisaged Charlton Heston for the role of Aubrey. So, who in the modern era comes closest to Heston's physical presence on screen, why Russell Crowe of course. Who not only brings that to the character, but also depth, because Aubrey comes with many traits. Strength, honour, stubbornness, leadership and loyalty are a given for a Captain on the high seas. Yet Aubrey is also vulnerable, self aware, playful, knows his limitations and is able to laugh at himself. Crowe peels off each layer and delivers a high quality performance - from our first encounter with Crowe as Aubrey, the realism so loved by Weir is given a shot in the arm - and it stays throughout the movie.\r\n\r\nSo an excellent piece of casting then, as is that of Paul Bettany as ships surgeon, science and nature lover, and best pal of the Captain, Stephen Maturin. Bettany and Crowe had formed a friendship on 2001's A Beautiful Mind, where their on screen chemistry lifted an already fine film, to an even better one. So it be here also. Stephen & Jack's relationship is the core of the piece, two very different men yet as tight as two peas in a pod, with Stephen serving as the code breaker for the audience as sea talk and tactical intrigue weaves in and out of the story. It's there where Bettany excels, for he not only has us believing in this warm (platonic) friendship, he's also got us rooting for him since he is in essence the odd man out on this ship. Our sympathy is firmly with him, our friendly rebel if you please. Of the rest there's note worthy turns from Billy Boyd, James D'Arcy & Edward Woodall, while Lee Ingleby gives a really heartfelt and emotionally engaging turn as the haunted Hollom.\r\n\r\nThe film is not without flaws, though. The pace of the piece does slip from time to time, while the talky middle section may stretch the patience of some, and the film isn't long enough to give the main characters some back story for the audience to work off. Yet it's still a terrific movie, ripe with intelligence and interesting characterisations, and boasting enough adrenalin, humour and upset to fill out a big budgeted 1950s historical epic. So get on board folks, for this is quality film making and it demands to be seen via the best format available. 9/10"

O'Brian has written a lot of great sea tales, but this one confused me. I felt like checking to see if the pages were in the correct order. The story seems simplified in this adaptation. (Some may say that is not a good thing!)\r\n\r\nThe first several minutes of the film move the viewer around the ship, and I felt like It was a realistic representation of what it was like to sail on it. The creaking and other ever-present noises, the tight spaces allotted to the crew, all helped me feel like I knew what it was like more than just reading about it.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters aboard ship, so out of necessity some of them never really developed, but even the glimpses we get of them here and there illustrate that they are people, not stereotypes. There were a few rather unlikely plot turns later on in the film, but by then I was drawn into the story and right there with the crew, so I forgave them.  I have watched Master and Commander twice so far, and wouldn't be averse to seeing it again."

The constant (supremely shot) action is a major plus, as are the performances of Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany.

Russell Crowe delivers a strong, convincing, portrayal of the doughty captain \"Aubrey\", in command of HMS \"Surprise\" and charged with tracking down a French privateer that is raiding the vital British whaling fleet during the Napoleonic wars. Coming up against an equally courageous and skilful French captain and engaging in a lethal game of cat and mouse, he must outmanoeuvre this cunning foe before he and his crew end up in Davy Jones' Locker. The film nods to the social issues and superstitions of living on a 19th Century frigate and to bravery (and cowardice) in a subtle yet plausible way. Above all, it's an adventure film and there is plenty of action as we go. A strong ensemble cast in support (though Paul Bettany as the doctor and \"Aubrey's\" best friend on this voyage didn't quite wash with me) complement some great maritime cinematography; a good score and Peter Weir's able and exciting direction."

The film is really split into two halves here with this one being basically helped greatly by its really good possession and shock scenes. The opening scene that sets her up to becoming possessed is one of it's best sequences, as the long hallway and the unearthly voices floating around give it an unearthly feel while the first scene in the classroom where she sees a demonic face appearing in the window through a cloud of mist and turns around to see a student's face turn into a distorted demon's face giving off an unearthly roar makes it quite shocking. Running out into the rain and seeing more demonic faces give off the same unearthly roar is a bit clichéd, but it still helps to sell the mood while the finale in the church giving this a quite creepy conclusion. The different manners of how she’s become afflicted are quite memorable moments with the frenzied bug-eating, speaking in tongues or just contorting her body into such impossible positions that it really becomes obvious something is wrong with her, and the long, suspenseful and chilling exorcism is the film's selling point, coming off with any number of creepy ideas and scenes in such a drawn-out style is one of the best scenes in the film. Otherwise, beyond the shocks and the exorcism, there isn't much else to like about it. Therefore, everything else in it doesn't really work which is only relegated to the courtroom battle drama. It's marketed as being a supernatural possession film, and the best moments come from those scenes, but the fact that the majority of the film is a courtroom battle with the supernatural elements coming in the form of flashbacks is a real misstep and is likely to confuse those coming in expecting the other kind of film. It's not that they're boring or anything, it's just that it's out of nowhere that it becomes that way, and it can be a disappointment. The fact that these are slow and really long don't help matters, extending this out far longer than it should. This could've easily been an hour and a half, or maybe a little longer, but the two hours running time forces it to keep the courtroom antics going for no reason other than to extend the running time. A few extraneous scenes could've been snipped as well, including the introductory scenes at the bar that repeat information we already know and also keep the running time going, and most of the time simply elicit a feeling of wanting to move along and get to the good scenes. These really harm the film.\r\n\r\nRated PG-13: Language, Mild Violence and intense demonic and spiritual themes."

As he starts to crack under the pressure of the job, and getting no help from a succession of zany partners, Frank may just find solace with an ex-junkie girl who's father he brought in dying of a heart attack.\r\n\r\nMartin Scorsese can never be accused of not being adventurous, after dabbling in Eastern spiritualism with 1997s Kundun, he returns to New York and tackles a wing of America's tortured heroes. Based on the novel by Joe Connelly, Bringing Out The Dead is at times a difficult watch in many ways, but it's haunting poignancy is told with brilliantly adroit ease from one of America's famed directors, whilst it has to be said that the humour that is in there is darkly genius in its execution. We are along for the ride with haunted Frank for three days (and nights) as he and his borderline bonkers partners deal with overdoses, heart attacks, drunks and a notably cynical virgin birth! As Frank starts to see ghosts of people he couldn't save in the past, Scorsese and his team treat us to an adrenalin fuelled nightmare, the editing (Thelma Schoonmaker) is swift and explosive like, Robert Richardson's cinematography framing certain aspects of this journey with impacting deftness, and then we have the soundtrack.\r\n\r\nScorsese is always a man who takes great care in sound tracking his movies, in fact few modern day directors can touch his knack for a perfect soundtrack. Fusing Motown with 70s Punk Rock would seem an odd combination, but all of it works as the paramedics start to feel the strain and (in some cases) as the mania takes hold. It's rare to hear a New York Dolls track in a movie, to hear a Johnny Thunders solo track is as rare as a dog that speaks Norwegian, and here the use of Thunders' You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory is pitch perfect, impacting so. Such is the use of early Clash standards as our protagonists feed off each others precarious mental conditions, it's a soundtrack to savour basically.\r\n\r\nNicholas Cage plays Frank Pierce, and it's a great performance full of restraint and honesty, it's the sort of performance that his detractors tend to forget about such is its emotive simplicity. Tom Sizemore (wonderfully manic), Ving Rhames, John Goodman and Patricia Arquette fill out the cast and all do fine work, but I'm sure they would be the first to acknowledge the excellence of Paul Schrader's screenplay. This piece is far from being a masterpiece, but with it's intensity sitting side by side with a paramedics need for coping, it's clear that Scorsese and his talented team have made one of the most astute and undervalued pieces of the 90s. 9/10"

While it’s still in dock, it’s easy to believe in the boat’s reality and all that it entails; once it goes underwater, however, it also goes belly up. Like the Tom Hanks vehicle Greyhound from a couple of years ago, K-19 is at its best when the action stays in the vessel – and for a film where there are a lot of drills, this one is packed with tension and suspense.\r\n\r\nThe ‘exterior’ shots, on the other hand, makes us long for the claustrophobia of the sub’s narrow walkways. The worst offender is the scene in which Ford orders a very dangerous maneuver (and that’s saying something, seeing how Neeson keeps “recommending” him that they remain “at safe depth”) that culminates in the K-19 bursting through the Arctic pack ice. This sequence reminded me, believe it or not, of The Silence of the Lambs; specifically, the part with the crosscutting (you know the one I mean).\r\n\r\nIn that movie, parallel editing led us to believe that two separate events were closely related; in K-19, though, we have the opposite: two closely related events – the sub breaking trough the ice and the crew holding on for dear life – give the impression of occurring worlds apart from each other, because while the people come across as real human beings, the ice and the sub suffer from a pervading Saturday Morning Cartoon quality; i.e., they are shoddy as all hell. \r\n\r\nAll things considered, this is nonetheless a minor yet not altogether unsuccessful incursion from director Kathryn Bigelow on the kind of usually testosterone-laden genre that even on an off day she does better than many a male filmmaker."

It's a synch that the 2-kopeck systems aboard this state of the art Russian boat \"K-19\" are going to cause the maiden voyage to be riddled with dangers, and Captain Harrison Ford who blindly believes that nothing can possibly go wrong both before and after the boat sets sail leads to loads of crew resentment - not least from Executive Officer Liam Neeson - who all see him as a sort of \"Captain Bligh\" figure. Technically, the film does evoke a genuine sense of peril and claustrophobia, but the stars don't really have enough to work with beyond their very two-dimensional characterisations and the sight of John Shrapnel (whose son Lex also features) as a Soviet Admiral is verging on the risible. It has moments of pace, and jeopardy - but they are few and far between and more than nullified by the rather dodgy CGI and really pedestrian script."

Donald Sutherland plays Hudson's new rich boss and Alexis Dziena his bimbo-ish daughter. Ray Winstone and Kevin Hart also factor in as potential villains.\r\n\r\nIf you can imagine serious island-thrillers like \"The Deep\" and the two \"Into the Blue\" flicks mixed with a heavy dose of comedy and cartoonish action you'd have a good idea of \"Fool's Gold.\" It's basically \"The Goonies\" as adults in the Bahamas. \r\n\r\nKate and McConaughey look great and are great together, and everyone else is likable, even the villains (sort of). The problem is the movie is too long at 1 hour, 52 minutes. A silly, fun film like should limit the runtime to around 85-100 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe story takes place in (or near) the Bahamas, but the film was shot on the east coast of Queensland, and you can tell. The coast of Queensland is gorgeous but it lacks the lushness of the Caribbean. Regardless, the film is worth watching just for the locations, especially on a cloudy fall day or a cold winter night.\r\n\r\nSo this is a fun island flick with romance, treasure-hunting and adventure, but it’s a little too long for such goofy antics. For the real deal in oceanic thrillers check out 2009's \"Into the Blue 2: The Reef,\" which IMHO is way better than the original \"Into the Blue\" from 2005. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

The few people giving this a 1 or 2 star rating must be disgruntled French people who do not like to see the French government officials portrayed as corrupt bastards (which they often are anyway).\r\n\r\nI generally like Liam Neeson so the fact that he is in the movie kind of got the movie off to a good start already. In this movie he plays a real badass, I-kick-the-shit-out-of-anyone-standing-in-my-way, former CIA agent hunting down the despicable low-life that kidnapped his daughter. I really, really liked the role he played in this movie. He makes characters like Bourne look like wussy. Even I was surprised when he actually shot the wife of the corrupt French government bastard to get him to talk. That was just awesome.\r\n\r\nThe movie is pretty much action all the way. Well, it starts off laying the groundwork for the story and here Liam Neeson is indeed playing a fairly timid father that seems to be a bit out of his depth. Once he gets thrown into his right element he quickly casts of the sheep's fur and reveals the wolf (sabre-toothed) underneath.\r\n\r\nThis is really a textbook action/thriller movie.

Charismatic and believable as a father hell bent on finding the one thing worthwhile that he has in his life, it's only here that Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen's uneven writing gets any sort of urgency to go with the tidily put together action sequences. Taken is an enjoyable film if taken within the context of its genre, and for sure the subject matter of skin trafficking is a noteworthy plot, but no one can surely deny it doesn't have a shallow core and honestly isn't giving anything new to a pretty stagnated formula... \r\n\r\nBy the by, the thrills ensure popcorn pleasing pleasures and thus it's rated as such. 7/10"

        "content": "\"If hellholes like this didn't exist, I'm sure you would invent one\"\r\n\r\nThis film is almost, but not quite, exactly what the lurid title would suggest. It's definitely going for shocks as its primary source of horror, with a lot of this being truly hard to watch (I saw the uncut version, with animal cruelty intact, and I can see why they're cut from most versions, although there is a certain level of hypocrisy in condemning those scenes if you eat meat - and I doubt everyone who has ever criticised it were all vegetarian or vegan - unless you think that what goes on in slaughterhouses is any kinder that the animal slaughter depicted in this film, or that recording it somehow makes a moral difference), and has well earned its reputation for brutality. However, there's a deeper element to the horror. All the violence and cannibalism and rape is truly gruelling to sit through, but the scenes between those are, in their own way, just as grotesque.\r\nAs strange as it may sound, one film that this strongly reminded me of was The Searchers, reminding us of the fact that so-called \"primitive\" peoples are separated from us only by circumstance, that there is nothing making the \"civilised\" world inherently better, that the wilderness is always right next door.\r\nOf course, this is rather problematic in itself. Because, in case the title didn't clue you in, this film has no interest in being sensitive. It is still exploitative. The question this film poses is more along the lines of \"are we truly any better than nasty primitive violent cannibalistic tribes?\", and certainly has far more in the way of contempt for civilisation than compassion for the supposedly \"uncivilised\". It's a common refrain by now; \"Cannibal Holocaust claims to be satirising exploration while also being itself exploitative\". This criticism... I understand it, but I feel it relies on a verbal sleight of hand. An \"exploitation film\" may contain the word \"exploitation\", but it is not the same as exploiting people.\r\nThat said, we mustn't forget that the native actors in the film genuinely were mistreated. They weren't treated all that much better by the real film crew than by the in-movie one. Some of the stuff that happened on the set of this makes Kubrick-making-The-Shining look like the Buddha. There's no real way around it, the set of this movie was an abusive environment. The director of this movie, Ruggero Deodato, is an abusive arsehole who was particularly nasty to women and native actors. Fuck him.\r\nAnd yet, I still can't help but be fascinated by the film, even if I don't necessarily want to ever see it again. There is certainly some craft to this. From Riz Ortolani's beautiful score providing an actually effective counterpoint to the incredibly brutal scenes of horror to the raw documentary style that strips everything down to the most naked barbarism, this is a film that has an aesthetic you won't see in many others, at the very least. Even now \"found footage\" is as family a horror subgenre as \"monster movie\" or \"slasher\", this, along with Blair Witch, still holds up as something special. Sure, the framing device may be unorthodox in modern examples of the genre, but the bits that are in that style genuinely do feel like we're watching somebody's last moments on film. The acting is... variable, which sometimes breaks the illusion, but, perversely, it helps in a way that a lot of the cast seem genuinely uncomfortable, so don't HAVE to act for a lot of it.\r\nAnd yes, this is very influential. You can see all the familiar tropes of the found footage genre, right down to the cast being massive arseholes that you kinda want to see eaten by the end. Yes, as I say, the framing device is unorthodox, but it's not like there's no reason for it to be in the film or anything. It goes without saying that it would be a very different film without it, and probably wouldn't have nearly as many reviews on here. The footage story is of course where most of the scenes that fans of \"extreme cinema\" remember are from, but the frame story is part of the reason why this still an independent cult following outside of people who will simply watch anything with enough mutilation in it. The most targeted part, in my mind, comes when we see the footage of the in-film documentary \"The Last Road to Hell\", and the opening credits are in the same style as the actual opening credits to this film.\r\nBut there comes a point if we have to ask how genuine this is? Is this film truly a critique of colonialism and exploitation, or is it just trying to make pretensions to something more than a schlocky cannibal flick? Is it just trying to make you feel less guilty for watching it, or more guilty?\r\nI don't think there are any easy answers. This is a wholly unattractive film, and knows it. The cruelty is both a means to and end and an end in itself simultaneously.\r\nAll in all, Cannibal Holocaust isn't necessarily a film I can in any good concience recommend, because my God is it hard to watch, nor can I really say I'm even glad it exists, knowing what went on behind the scenes, but I can say the world of cinema would lose something tangible if this film were deleted from history. For better or for worse.\r\nOK, so today I've been writing various quick reviews-from-memory of various randomly selected movies I've seen before, and this was meant to be one of those, but ultimately this review turned out way longer than expected, so I hope I actually said anything worthwhile in that whole length rather than just rambling. Not sure why this of all films got the extended review for today, but I guess it is a film that sticks in your mind, and due to its nature it's not something many people are willing to see so it's easier to say things that haven't been said ten billion times already, so I guess the combination of those two factors resulted in me feeling I had the most to say about this one. Whatever the case, I hope I actually DID say something worthwhile lol."

It's more of a Western Caper with amusing flashes, mainly due to Reynold's fun-loving title character. \r\n\r\nThe same plot was later used in John Wayne’s “The Train Robbers” (1973) with Ann-Margret in the Angie Dickinson role, minus the caper in the third act. They’re both worth checking out, but I favor “The Train Robbers” because, to me, the caper in the last act gets kind of tedious, not to mention unbelievable. Nevertheless, “Sam Whiskey” features a great cast with fun-lovin’ chemistry and quality Western locations.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed that the story takes place circa 1870-75 since it is detailed that Sam was a spy during the Civil War and he appears to be around 30-35 tops. Actually, the earliest the story COULD have taken place would be 1906, which is when the Denver Mint began minting coins, but this would make Whiskey about 65 years old, which he obviously isn’t. Adding to the problem, the Carson City Mint shut down in 1893. So the timeline is all fudged up.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 36 minutes and was shot at Universal City, Burbank and Lake Camanche, Ione, California (with underwater scenes done in Silver Springs, Florida).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)"

The cast are uniformly excellent, Julie Walters, Helen Mirren (gorgeous), Linda Basset, Annette Crosbie and Geraldine James are particularly memorable in telling this tale of a close-knit village quite unsure on how to deal with a touchy subject. From there the press sensationalism arrives and this shifts the girls (and sadly the film) to another plane.\r\n\r\nThe picture manages to be that rare old thing of a comedy drama actually impacting heavy on both fronts. The comedy moments are joyous and flow frequently for the first two thirds of the picture, whilst the touching drama, of what is a serious subject at its core after all, really touches a nerve. Sadly as we enter the final third, the makers tag on an unnecessary dissection of friendships and relationships, and it nearly costs the film dear. It does survive, mainly due to the wonderful cast and the integrity laden point of view, making it a film that once viewed is clearly not going to be forgotten. So in the main we should all hail those wonderful Calendar Girls. 7/10"

Well, it's in a garage that \"Chris\" (Helen Mirren) spots one and it gives her inspiration. Why? Her best friend \"Annie\" (Julie Walters) has recently become a widow following the death from cancer of her beloved husband \"John\" (John Alderton), and they are trying to organise a fund raiser to buy a new sofa for their local hospice. With another vodka tasting already ruled out by their slightly prudish WI President \"Marie\" (Geraldine James) they have to think out of the box, or in this case out of the bra! Yep, she decides to recruit another eleven of her friends and then rope in Richard Glenister's \"Lawrence\" as the photographer to create a tasteful yet provocative showcase for their beauty. Of course this isn't a straightforward procedure, there are reservations from \"Marie\", their husbands and even themselves in the beginning but once they've decided... Up to this point, this grand assembly of British stage and screen talent delivers a pithily written, even brave, look at sexuality amongst the older generations. The dialogue is funny and acutely observational at times, and a really solid cast with Celia Imrie, Annette Crosbie and Penelope Wilton all delivering well into the humorous meleé comes across really well. It's the second part that doesn't work quite so well. A trip to star on the \"Tonight\" show with Jay Leno sows some seeds of martial and familial discord, and this all rather slows the pace down. Though doubtless faithful to this true story, I just felt we could have done without it and just focussed on the joy - and there is plenty of that - of the thing. There's a good dynamic between Mirren and Walters and even now, twenty years later, this has a potency that has to question whether anyone would do it at all nowadays. It's good fun, this."

        "content": "The circumstances around Terence Malick's <i>The Thin Red Line</i> are sometimes more talked about than the film itself. The reclusive director had made a big splash in the Seventies, but there followed two decades of silence. When he finally reappeared in 1998 to direct this adaptation of James Jones's novel about the Battle of Guadalcanal in World War&nbsp;II, many actors were desperate to work with him and he was able to gather a large ensemble cast. He shot over five hours of footage but had to cut it down to three, leaving out many actors entirely from the finished version.\r\n\r\n<i>The Thin Red Line</i> tells of the American battle against Japanese forces on the island from the landing on its beach to the time the initial troops are relieved and sail off for some new, unknown deployment. But it actually begins shortly before this when Private Witt (Jim Caviezel), who has been AWOL and living with the local Melanesian people on a nearby island, is discovered by a patrol and brought in before his sargeant. The battle itself involves the men of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division: besides Caviezel as Witt, major roles are played by Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, Adrien Brody and Ben Chaplin. Elias Koteas is Capt. Staros, who tries to look out for his men, while a hyperbolic Nick Nolte plays their commander who sees the infantry as nothing but cannon fodder to wrecklessly throw at the Japanese.\r\n\r\nFor most of its 3-hour length, the men are torn apart by Japanese machine gun fire as they try to take a hill, but the enemy is never directly seen. Between scenes of great violence, there are portentous voiceovers by various characters as they meditate on what war says about the larger human drama. Eventually US forces are able to overcome Japanese positions, and the Japanese side of the offensive is depicted with more fairness and equanimity than in most American films on the Pacific Theatre of the war.\r\n\r\nWhile the realistic depiction of battle might touch viewers -- and its hard to knock any World War&nbsp;II film since they spur one to read more about this crucial event in history, this is not a great film. It has obviously been cut heavily from its original length. John C. Reilly appears several times at the centre of shots, clearly meant to be a major character, but most of his scenes and all of his back story were cut. The philosophic voiceovers come across as pretentious instead of insightful. Furthermore, I find this a very \"Hollywood\" film, with the acting often exaggerated. Woody Harrelson doesn't play a WWII grunt, he plays Woody Harrelson. George Clooney appears at the end and all realism goes out the window: there's no way this suave, handsome leading man has been fighting a war for some time now. Hans Zimmer's musical score too obviously pulls the audience towards prescribed emotions."

All of that due process is soon abandoned as their squad is assigned to take an important hill position from an entrenched Japanese force on Guadalcanal. It is a very untypical film, this - whilst there is certainly plenty of action, pyrotechnics, bullets (and limbs) flying all round, this is a much more cerebral look at the impact of war. The claustrophobia - even in the open air - of people who neither lived nor slept in peace or safety for weeks on end; their weariness and exhaustion, their dedication, bravery and - it has to be said, moments of fear and doubt is presented to us using some strong and potent characterisations. Even the moments of victory are tempered with sorrow and reality - the opposing forces are humanised to an extent that makes this whole thought-provoking story more poignant. Penn is good, as is their overbearing CO \"Col. Tail\" (Nick Nolte) and a strong ensemble cast of faces - famous and less so - sustain this well for much of the almost three hours it is on screen. What struck me most about the settings were just how inherently hostile they were to human beings at the best of times, and yet there we were fighting over them - palm tress and beautifully coloured birds!"

Indeed, had we a bit more of these scenes and less of the rather obvious and clumsy espionage malarkey, it might have been a better film. As it is, though, it plays the parody hand just a bit too heavily for me and after a while the cultural clashes appeared to be as much between the star and his largely British supporting cast as much as having anything to do with scheming generals. It's not a film that needs your concentration, it has a reasonably toe-tapping soundtrack and if you aim low, you ought not to be disappointed."

There’s a little bit of adventure and, unsurprisingly, romance. Right off the bat the relationship between the two is characterized by amusing bickering, which isn’t exactly realistic.

Also, the Amazon rain forest is the size of a huge country and lightly populated, is it very likely that the road being built would go directly into where the much-needed ingredient exists, not to mention the tribe?\r\n\r\nStill, there are entertaining elements and, sometimes, a palpable sense of wonder. Bracco has her feminine appeal and is amusing as Rae Crane, albeit annoying to some tastes (like Connery’s character isn’t?).\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in Southern Mexico, the area of Catemaco, Veracruz, Mexico (producers learned from money pits such as \"The Emerald Forest\" that shoots in the actual Amazon Basin just cost too much).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

        "content": "_**Hope for scum**_\r\n\r\nThree young female surfers in Hawaii support their lifestyle as maids at a high-class hotel. Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) has dreams of going professional, but she has to get over her past failures and her family's breakup to succeed. In the meantime a vacationing NFL quarterback (Matthew Davis) romances her and she has to determine if their relationship is serious or not. Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake co-star as Anne Marie's surfing friends.\r\n\r\n\"Blue Crush\" (2002) is a 'sports film' in the manner of \"Karate Kid\" and a host of others. Although some of these movies go the comedy route -- e.g. \"Cloud 9\" and \"Bad News Bears\" -- \"Crush\" is a serious drama with fun flashes.\r\n\r\nFilmed on the beaches/resorts of O'ahu, Hawaii, this is a beautiful and exhilarating film to watch, the perfect remedy if the weather in your area has been dreary.\r\n\r\nThere's no profanity, raunch or t&a exploitation but, to be expected, the film features some good-looking women in swimwear throughout. By \"good-looking\" I mean realistically so, not like Baywatch.\r\n\r\nFor the first hour the film was pretty much what I expected it to be, nothing great but moderately entertaining for this type of flick, and then something happened at the the 58-minute mark that struck a chord. Anne Marie hits the waves with her friend (Rodriquez) to prepare for the Pipeline Masters as we hear the song \"Youth of the Nation\" by P.O.D. This sequence touched me for some reason. The music & lyrics are emotionally potent and effectively set the tone for the remainder of the film.\r\n\r\n\"Youth of the Nation\" exemplifies the zeitgeist of the new millennium much as \"My Generation\" represents the mid-60s and \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" typifies the 90s. Everyone's heard the song by now but if you're not sure go to Youtube and listen to it with lyrics; it's a standout piece, including the heartrending lyrics. It's reality.\r\n\r\nFor me, the film's just compelling enough to give a marginal thumbs up. Fans of surfing and Bosworth (or any of the other actors) will appreciate \"Blue Crush\" more than me. But I was moved by the above musical interlude and one other thing...\r\n\r\nWhat affected me most is the picture of the three maids, impoverished and disdained by the snobs but full of youthful zeal and hope. It strangely reminded me of something I experienced on my last trip to Southern California. I was leaving the last showing of a theater late at night and spied the janitorial crew coming in to clean with their mops & buckets. They were Mexicans, mostly young, and possibly illegal aliens. Everyone walked by them as if they were invisible, like they were the scum of society or something. But I made a point to acknowledge them and smile. I don't feel I deserve a medal for this or anything; it's just that I made a decision long ago that, no matter how far I go in life, I'm not going to look down on or ignore those in a more modest position. Why? I don't know, maybe because I'M scum.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

        "content": "Brick is a detective/noir film but to the viewer’s surprise, in a high-school setting. It is written and independently directed by Rian Johnson. At the mention of any movie revolving around high school or teenagers, all that comes to mind are the various stereotypes but this movie gives a surprise to the viewer.\r\nThe story revolves around a particular, rather abrupt and frantic phone call received by the high school misfit, Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) from his terrified ex-girlfriend, Emily Kostich (Emilie de Ravin) who begs him for his help. Brendan vows to investigate and solve her murder himself and is - in the process - forced to mingle with the very same high school stereotypes that he so diligently avoided. The character of Brendan is quite the risk taker, fearless to investigate all possible sources of information with the help of his only friend and a stereotypical nerd ‘The Brain’. With his vigilant tactics, he is determined to get his way into the neighborhood’s suspicious drug and crime network connected by some of the high school students and the local gang/drug leader ‘The Pin’; in order to get around to solving the mystery.\r\nRian Johnson took some time to write the script which took inspiration from multiple sources like the noir film era of the 30s-40s. While taking its plot and feel from the celebrated American author Dashiell Hammett’s detective novels, the film is also largely inspired by the Anime “Cowboy Bebop”. Brendan’s character shows a huge influence of the lead character from the anime. Rian has focused greatly on minute details. Each character in the film has a connection with the other making the plot more complex and intricate. Also, a really vague (or maybe not so vague) thing I observed was the alliteration. The title of the film is “Brick”, the characters are “Brendan”, “Brain” & “Brad”. I think this was done deliberately to provoke the thinking of the audience.\r\nA hard to miss fact is that there are only two adults in the movie. One, The Pin's mother; she is in the kitchen as her son makes his deals, making breakfast and pouring juice for his friends, while the film's only other adult, the school vice-president who is using Brendan as an informant. Another amusing writing wonder was the absence of education and parents from the entire high-school/ teenage setup. Small humorous elements keep the film going. The scene when Brendan reaches the coffee place and messes with the straw (a kid is drinking juice from) there will surely make one laugh. Another one is when The Pin’s mother searches for milk to serve Brendan and her son is there with his muscle power making a crime deal.\r\nNow coming to another major aspect that makes the film do wonders is the cast: led by a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt as loner Brendan Frye. It is a film that he made before he was getting big. He was in that transitional phase between child star and adult actor and this is one of the first movies that displayed the true talent that he really has. His character shows such grit that he takes huge amounts of beatings from “Tugger” just to meet “The Pin” Some of the other characters in the film that steal the show are that of the local drug lord “The Pin” played by Lucas Haas and the geeky/nerdy character of “The Brain” played by Matt 0’Leary. It was so enticing that a big number of fan theories suggest that the character of Brain didn’t exist at all and it was just Brendan taking the help of his conscience. Basically, like Sherlock’s ‘Mind Palace.’\r\nThe visual set up, lighting and sound design also perfectly compliment the vibe of the film, with effective variations to fit the intensity of what is going on. For the kind of small budget involved; a short 20-day shooting period; the use of feasible editing; production and VFX equipment, the film definitely does not disappoint on screen. The edit team did a great job on the various transitions involved. The ones that mesmerised me in particular were the ‘time transitions’ and the ‘light to dark transitions’. In a couple shots, the scene transitions into another with the focus on the digital clock in Brendan’s bedroom. As a lover of inventive cinematography, the biggest standout for me was the framing, everything is shot from a lower angle, and many characters are defined as much by their shoes as anything else. DP Steve Yedlin made a point that each character’s establishing shot begins with their shoes (making the audience more curious and confused) and then gradually reaches to a close-up. This creativity is well-thought and well-executed. The impressive background score is composed by director Rian Johnson’s own cousin Nathan Johnson. It is mainly made up of Xylophone-like sounds but during fight scenes it shifts to percussion sounds and strings sounds during intense/climax scenes. The combination score is a mixture of both traditional and home invented instruments giving a strange balance in the background.\r\nBrick is a thoroughly enjoyable film, an experimental debut by the director that was surely a huge risk. It is a perfect homage to the noir classics and at the same time, it is a dark and effective take on a high school student’s life belonging to a small town. The viewer is intrigued by the blunt character of the protagonist and is forced to get into his universe. However, those who are not fascinated by indie/experimental films in general might find it boring or confusing. But it surely won’t disappoint anyone."

Also starring are Chris Rock, Burt Reynolds, James Cromwell and William Fitchner.\r\n\r\nOne time gridiron superstar Paul Crewe, now disgraced, gets himself sent to a prison run by a gridiron fanatical warden. Coerced into being part of a match between the guards and the cons, Crewe has his work cut out to make a team out of misfits, runts and near idiots!\r\n\r\nAdam Sandler has always proved divisive, and this film has proved to be no exception. Massively popular at the box office (over $100 million profit), it's a film that anyone with an aversion to Sandler should stay away from. I mean if by 2005 you hadn't realised he's not for you then why would you watch this?\r\n\r\nComing from someone who absolutely adores the original film, I had no hesitation in watching this, I like Sandler and I don't mind remakes as I'm always intrigued to see how they pan out. This is full of prison stereotypes, close to the knuckle humour and meaty violence, but is it funny? From my perspective yes it is, very much so, with some of the dialogue sparkling and delivered with comedic grace by a fine cast. But that's me, others, as we know, don't feel the same. \r\n\r\nThe action is well put together by Segal, the convicts training sequences are great fun, while the main game that crowns the pic is exciting, dramatic and yes, great fun. The support slots contain more beef than an Aberdeen Angus stew, with the likes of Michael Irvin, Terry Crews, Steve Austin and Brian Bosworth fronting up, while David Patrick Kelly playing a weasel is never a bad thing. A lot of people loved it in 2005, I'm now one of their number. 7/10"

I know this is known for the excellent animation styling, the catchy tunes, and charming coming of age semantics, but this uses several strong formulas that have been used since Aesop's fables.\r\n\r\nAnd that's what made me realize the writing quality, I felt as if I was watching an on fable with moral lessons of consequence.  Up until that point I was mentally preparing how this 1967 animation is actually a perfect metaphor for 2020 entitled child entering the real world: never being told no, even to the threat of great, potentially lethal, loss because even in the face of danger, they've been taught that they deserve, even in the logic that it can't be true on both sides though both believe that.  Hmmm, that sounds a lot like religious war.\r\n\r\nDigressing back to the writing: Mowgli embodies naivety, narcissism, entitlement, whatever you would like to call as he's a victim / ward of extreme chances of compassion: he just happens to luck into survival wherever he goes.  While Tarzan makes more sense, this is character development for the series of situations (each one their own potential fable) with the main character shifting to and fro from Bagera to Mowgli to Balloo, each one being taught lessons as the adventure continues.\r\n\r\nWith the representation of the jungle and the adversities that Mowgli faces, Mowgli slowly learns what Bagera and Baloo both know: most people are only interested in their own interests, but sometimes those that have enough can be in a position to help others.  The xenoism (racism) that Sher Khan has for Mowgli as a human is enough for these predators give up his companionship to help him to the man-village.\r\n\r\nThe really odd lesson is that Mowgli embraces the self-interest needed in the jungle, despite dialogue to the contrary."

It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern.\r\n\r\nWalter Hill's variant on Yojimbo, plot basically sees Willis as drifter John Smith, who after arriving in the dusty town of Jericho, promptly sets about making some serious cash by playing the town's two gangs off against each other. Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration.\r\n\r\nThe look and sound is terrific, Cooder's pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn't up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise. It also means that much of the cast are given only morsels to feed on. A shame when you got Walken and Kelly on overdrive when on screen.\r\n\r\nIt's an odd blend of a Western with Prohibition Noir characters, but it's unmistakably a Walter Hill film. For his fans there's enough to like about it whilst accepting it's a bit of a throwaway on the page. For the casual crime/action film fan, however, it's likely to be much ado about nothing. 7/10"

        "content": "_**Wiping out the \"galactic weed**_\"\r\n\r\nReleased in 1995, \"Species\" chronicles events after SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) receives a transmission from outer space detailing alien DNA structure, along with instructions on how to splice it with human DNA. This gives birth to Sil, a girl (Michele Williams) who escapes and rapidly grows into a statuesque blonde (Natasha Henstridge). Government agent Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) assembles a team to locate and destroy Sil before she finds a mate and breeds. The team includes a tough mercenary (Michael Madsen), an anthropologist (Alfred Molina), a molecular biologist (Marg Helgenberger) and an empath (Forest Whitaker).\r\n\r\nI developed a bad attitude toward \"Species\" for years due to Roger Ebert's scathing review, but changed my mind upon giving it an openminded viewing. This is a top-of-the-line sci-fi/adventure/horror flick. People look down on it because of the nudity and mild sex scenes, which prompts them to disdain it as exploitive and trashy. While Natasha Henstridge is a good-lookin' woman, she doesn't do anything for me (she's not my type) so I was able to totally overlook this element and focus on the film's other attributes.\r\n\r\nFor one, the score by Christopher Young is excellent. Secondly, the A-list cast is a highlight and their characters are increasingly fleshed-out in the story. Lastly, while people understandably write-off the movie as a Grade B plot with Grade A production, there's more here than meets the eye. For instance, Sil is the innocent pawn of the extraterrestrials who sent the DNA. Another example is the excellent character of Dan (Whitaker) whom whiners complain about as \"always pointing out the obvious\" when the movie shows over and over that he DOES know things the others don't and they ignore him to their own peril. Dan is necessary so that the team knows what direction the creature takes on repeated occasions; without Dan we'd see them pursue one boring dead-end after another.\r\n\r\nWhile snobby film critics love to hate \"Species\" it's a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi adventure with an interesting moral and a great cast of characters. If you like films like \"Alien,\" \"Aliens,\" \"Terminator,\" \"Terminator 2\" and \"Predator\" you'll probably appreciate it. It may not be as good as \"Aliens,\" \"Terminator\" and \"Terminator 2,\" but it's on par with \"Alien\" (and marginally better IMHO) and superior to \"Predator.\" Then again, it depends on what you want in a sci-fi blockbuster. As far as I'm concerned, \"Species\" delivers the goods.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 108 minutes and was shot in the areas of Los Angeles and Brigham City, Utah.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A- \r\n\r\n***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the movie) \r\n\r\nThe theory is postulated by the mercenary and biologist that the alien DNA was sent as a biological weapon, a \"weed killer\" from outer space to wipe out the galactic weed of earth or, more accurately, the human race that inhabits it. It's a fascinating concept and the film compellingly realizes it."

She is the product of alien and human DNA and can morph between a beautiful woman and a savage killer in the blink of an eye. Of course she escapes from the high security facility that couldn't keep a cow out, and is soon on the search for a man. Not any particular man, just one who can help her make a baby - and believe me, that's not a good plan! The scientists - led by \"Lennox\" (a rather charmless Michael Madson) and \"Baker\" (Marg Helgenberger) are on her trail but can they stop her before she finds a willing partner? To be fair, the visual effects - very \"Terminator\" (1984) style - are actually quite effective but the acting, especially from the always hammy Ben Kingsley, and the scripting are very bottom drawer. There's some imagination with the look of the film, but the delivery is pedestrian across the board before an ending that has an inevitability to it that I found a bit predictable. Not terrible, but a real missed opportunity that had it been cast better and just spent a little more time on the a more substantial story, could have created a better sense of menace and even a little (dark) humour."

It pretty much represents the best of the sometimes dubious genre (romcom).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area as well as the Phoenix/Tempe region of Arizona, including Lost Dutchman State Park just east of there.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

At times it's jaunty when the scene appears to call for menace, and at others just plain boring if the scene was meant to be actually funny (in that sarcastic, almost satirical way). The film could have worked at either being a comedy or a thriller, but the fusion of the two just doesn't work, and this failing has to fall at Williamson's door, it's as if Scream was all a fluke after all? The cast struggle with the meanderingly dull screenplay, only the stoic (and sexy) Helen Mirren salvaging any sort of dignity by realising early on that the core of the film calls for deft nastiness instead of outright villainy.\r\n\r\nPoor and practically unwatchable these days. 2/10"

Determined to finally get his man, Dooley enlists the help of a police dog called Jerry Lee (The Killer) to hopefully sniff out the drugs that he knows Lyman is involved in. Trouble is is that Dooley has no idea how to treat a dog and Jerry Lee is more of a maverick cop than he is!\r\n\r\nGiven its low rating, it's hard to know what sort of film the critics and general movie watching public were expecting with this one. Since a buddy buddy cop movie staring James Belushi and a German Shepherd Dog doesn't say anything other than the film we actually get. By the time of K-9's release it was evident what sort of film would be Belushi's staple money earner, the kind that called for him to play the cocky quipper with a glint in his eye. Belushi would try to abandon his buffoonery roles post Curly Sue (who could blame him after that mess really?), and attempt to be a more dramatic action type actor. It wouldn't work, his excellent performances in Oliver Stone's Salvador and The Principal (the latter also criminally undervalued) were long behind him. So you hear the name James Belushi in relation to films and you by and large think larking about action comedies. Coming a year after Red Heat (it looks like Belushi is wearing the same suit from that film in this one!), K-9 delivers exactly what it screamed out it would from the off.\r\n\r\nTechnically the film has very few things to recommend, but as a family friendly action comedy it has much to laud. The interplay between man and dog is great fun, they are both members of the animal kingdom, they both got needs and they are both great cops. Yes we are never in any doubt that after a troubled start, this pairing are going to become firm friends, and that ultimately, by hook, crook and paw, they will get the job done. Belushi has a nice line in facial comedy and he also never comes up short in delivering quips with panache, and a confidence that often belies the trouble his characters are often in. The dog too is hilarious (hats of to animal handler Robert Zides). Courtesy of writers Steven Siegel & Scott Myers, this is a dog that eats chili and wants to vie with Dooley for Tracy's affections (Mel Harris as Dooley's frustrated girlfriend). It makes for a number of funny set-ups that both man and beast revel at being involved in. Kevin Tighe as villain Lyman is a touch under written, and the obligatory emotional heart tugger moment now looks like over egging the formula pudding. But this is harmless witty fun that gets in and does its job without proclaiming to be anything other than what it is. 7/10"

Hot in pursuit are the police but they are having little effect until they decide to let the ruthless \"Cristini\" (Tchéky Karyo) take charge of the investigation. What now ensues is an increasingly bizarre and surreal heist caper that leaves virtually nothing out of bounds with loads of violence, dark comedy, transvestism and then, more violence. I rather liked the ending - it was not what I was expecting nor is it typical of the genre. The writing is pretty ropey though, and the lighting could have been doing with some extra wattage so we could actually see what was going on for more of the time. As a drama it offers us a quickly paced and mildly entertaining, if very unlikely, glimpse of a seedy and grim sub-culture and Cassel - though he doesn't really feature so often - seems to be in his element. It won't be for everyone, this - it is actually quite sordid, and the narrative parodies just about everything from \"For A Few Dollars More\" (1965) to the \"French Connection\" (1971) with a bit of soft porn chucked in too. It's not great, no, and I don't imagine I will ever watch to again but still, I didn't hate it.."

Sadly, after about twenty minutes the story rather settles into a predictable pattern as she gradually manipulates the family, exploits and creates some cracks in the marriage (or tries to, anyway) before a denouement that is really rather weak and takes just a bit to long to arrive. The production is maybe just a bit too pristine, too sterile, to sustain the sense of peril and the dialogue is just too wordy with scenarios taking too long to cook. Still, it's quite watchable film just one that I think has dated rather over the last thirty years into a mediocre television thriller."

It stars Harrison Ford, Brian Dennehy, Bonnie Bedelia, Raúl Juliá, Paul Winfield, John Spencer and Greta Scacchi. Music is scored by John Williams and Richard Wolf, and cinematography is by Gordon Willis.\r\n\r\nProsecuting attorney Rusty Sabich (Ford) suddenly finds himself a murder suspect after his one time lover, Carolyn Polhemus (Scacchi), is found raped and murdered in her home. As the evidence piles up against him, and his marriage comes under further strain, Rusty hires top lawyer Sandy Stern (Juliá) to represent him when the case goes to trial. Battling the system that he knows inside out, Rusty finds that there's a big can of worms about to be opened.\r\n\r\nA tip top court room mystery drama that we could do with seeing more of these days. Expertly strung together by the director of All the Presidents Men and Sophie's Choice, Presumed Innocent isn't just a by the numbers legal who done it? The makers get in deep with the political machinations of a district attorney's office, the intricate steps of a police investigation, and of course the legal eagle operations of a court room. In to the mix is an horrendous crime, of which a lawyer himself is charged with committing, he may or may not be guilty of the crime, but wonderfully we are never sure until the astonishing finale plays out. The air of mystery hangs heavy throughout, nagging away like an itch you can't scratch, with Pakula neatly unfolding the drama in a collage of flashbacks, side-plots and present time intricacies. Mood is heightened by the photography of Gordon Willis, who along with Pakula's looming camera work, manages to convey a claustrophobic feel in keeping with an unstable marriage and a court room itself.\r\n\r\nA great cast is assembled for the picture. Ford expertly plays it low key, brooding intently, he makes us unsure as to his guilt or innocence, and that's a testament to how good his performance is. Bedelia is excellent as the stoic wife, holding it together as the marital cracks begin to appear, and Juliá dominates the second half of the picture as we shift to the court room. Dennehy does a nice line in morally compromised smarm, and Scacchi wonderfully exudes a femme fatale sexuality. Winfield is a mighty presence as the judge presiding over such a tricky case, and Spencer is as reliable as ever. Only disappointments come with the performances of Joe Grifasi and Tom Mardirosian, who as the prosecutors come across as wimpy and hardly brick tight lawyers trying a high profile murder case.\r\n\r\nAn intense and intellectual adult drama, Presumed Innocent is one of the best of its type from the modern era. 8.5/10"

        "content": "A week has passed since I watched this film. I wanted to let it sit with me for a bit before watching it again and giving it a proper response.\r\n\r\nFilms like this, which are hyped to an unbelievable degree, end up sending an audience to end up watching it with elevated expectations, only to be ultimately disappointed afterwards. It’s a fact that many films suffer considerably from this aspect of our cinephile culture, I’ve experienced it with many films before.\r\n\r\n_Chungking Express_ has a reputation that I think may be beyond what it intended, with it being an Out-of-Print title at Criterion, the prices for the Blu-ray being obnoxiously high, and the constant barrage of exuberant reactions from many who’ve seen the film. This kind of superficial intrigue alone can set me up with expectations that are likely to not be met. Every film that is being made does not intend to create this façade of a reputation, it’s just a film. Most creators are not there to make this kind of reaction happen out of their films, and yet, we somehow continue to do so…\r\n\r\nI’m rambling, aren’t I? I think this is just my criticism with film culture regarding the hyping of certain films.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, somehow, despite my attempts to condense these (potential) hyperbolic reactions, _Chungking Express_ may have exceeded my expectations. Perhaps that makes me a hypocrite regarding this issue, but then again, if I enjoyed the film to the extent at which it met my expectations (or surpassed them in this case), am I to be negatively looked at for criticizing these actions, but essentially having them work on me specifically with _Chungking Express_? If so, then let it be I guess. Regardless, this film was one of the best experiences I have had in a while.\r\n\r\nIt is surprisingly easy for me to connect with this film and its characters. All of them have a certain struggle they must deal with, whether it’d be relationship problems, not being able to move on, or even simply failing to accomplish a certain task. It’s all relatively simple if I think about it, there isn’t much in terms of characterization for many of the subjects in the film, and yet, I don’t believe there needs to be that much. Simply leaving it the way it is works extremely well, and I’m willing to believe that Wong Kar-Wai understood this.\r\n\r\nThere are statements that explain how Wong Kar-Wai essentially wrote scenarios for the film the morning of and shot the scenes later in the day. Easily, this could lead to a jumbled mess of separate ideas thrown together in the editing room at a feature length time. And yet, he stays consistent in the thematic ideas he proposes. Shot chronologically, the ideas set up through the first half of the film, have threads that continue onwards towards the second half.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite directors, Krzysztof Kieślowski, uses the elements of interconnectedness within his films. Regardless of how different the stories might be, there is something there that connects each story together. In _Chungking Express_, that idea is essentially brought out brazenly, to the extent at which it initially shocked me. That one moment at the half-way mark of the film, comes at you so fast, that afterwards you’re left gasped for what the film turns into. It’s a brazen switch of narrative, and yet, it’s still leaves the film to be connected altogether.\r\n\r\nThe expectations for love are very much tricky in it of themselves, as is shown with each character that one sees in the film. It’s not simple, it isn’t black and white, but rather a spectrum that one must align itself with, and possibly adapt to if necessary. To deal with the aspects of love in a film can either be hokey and misguided, or it can be meticulous and interesting. _Chungking Express_ finds a middle ground between these two, not dealing too much towards the intellectual side of these issues, but not straying away too far towards the clichéd. Wong Kar-Wai doesn’t treat these characters as caricatures. Sure, there are some humorous; sometimes childish, moments with Faye, but it doesn’t take away from her character. As with every subject in the film, there is something to latch on to. All around the thematic ideas of love, or the lack thereof, worked together so well, that it leads to these characters feeling authentic. Not simply words on a script.\r\n\r\nI really don’t know what else to say. I was awestruck the first time, and I feel even more so now. This is a film that really hit it home with me. More so than other films in the past.\r\n\r\nI’ll say this, by the end of the film, I had similar vibes to when I finished _Lost in Translation_ for the first time. Soon afterwards, that film was my favorite of all time for years.\r\n\r\nFilm culture is fascinating, it may lead to disappointing outcomes based on hyperbolic expectations, or it may lead to a film experience that you never thought were possible.\r\n\r\nI’m beginning to lean towards the latter with _Chungking Express_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a difference a day made, what a difference a film makes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBut then again, it all comes down to personal preference, so for all I know you may hate this film. I don’t know. You do you, and I’ll do me. Got it?"

The former, the dashing Takeshi Kaneshiro, who is struggling to come to terms with his recently ended relationship of five years. By way of a means to closure, he purchases a tin of pineapple each day with the expiry date of May 1st (then he will be 25 years old). Either they will have reconciled by then, or he must look for a new love - and perhaps an enigmatic, somewhat shady, lady in a raincoat and wearing a blonde wig might offer a solution? The second features the slightly older regular with this director, Tony Leung, who has also split from his long-term partner only to find a new girl working at the stall he gets his meal from in the evening. She is equally enigmatic - and has a penchant for \"California Dreamin'\" played very loudly too. Both stories are throughly enjoyable to watch, the humour is plentiful and subtle - and we are never quite sure how anything is going to pan out, or even if the two stories are going to end up over-lapping - right until the end. The hand held photography helps the personalities develop well, offering us intimacy and also an opportunity to become more immersed in the two gently developing character studies that are imbued with the colours and culture of this bustling urban landscape."

She is well respected by her peers and seems to be the epitome of the hardworking 1950s British housewife. Until, that is - a policeman arrives at her door and her world starts to cave in. Now we know from fairly early on that \"Vera\" likes to help girls out. To be fair - there are plenty of them who are eligible. Raising a family when rationing was still around, jobs thin on the ground and their men folks usually keen to run a mile (if they even knew/or cared) was a daunting prospect to many a young woman, bereft of familial or state support. She didn't take cash for her carbolic and syringe services, she just thinks she is doing the best for all concerned. Needless to say the morals of the time did not necessarily concur, the law certainly didn't - and so we are faced with a rather well presented and written analysis of the antiquated and illiberal situation in which many women found themselves. The film doesn't attempt to moralise - it allows each of us to observe her activities and to evaluate - almost on a case by case basis - the relative merits of her interventions and I think that is particularly effective when stimulating the debate that this film is bound to create. The supporting cast including a career defining contribution from Daniel Mays as her conflicted son \"Sid\", Eddie Marsan and Heather Craney allow the story to spread out covering not just the actions of \"Vera\" but also of the complicity - sympathetically and/or venally motivated - by those in the medical profession and those in the community who had less scruples in monetising the misfortune of others. Above all, this is thought provoking - there is no simple answer to what's going on here, and for that Staunton (and Mike Leigh) are to be commended. It's not for the fainted-hearted, but the most poignant of films never are."

Upon listening back to the footage of the crash, he hears two noises which point to a gun shot being fired at the car. So with the dead man in the car turning out to be a big political mover, he quickly finds himself spun into a web of intrigue, peril, paranoia and conspiracies. Can he and the girl stay alive long enough to solve the case?\r\n\r\nBlow Out finds De Palma at the top of his game, blending the twisty plot dynamics with virtuoso technical smarts. A number of scenes are striking, both visually and in execution and the garnering of acting performances. Pino Donaggio provides an unforgettable music score to marry up to the layers of sub-plots folding together, and cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond sharpens the primary colours (pic is awash with lurid pinks and purples - true neo-noir style) to give the story a Giallo like sheen that runs concurrent with the emotional states of the major players.\r\n\r\nA sprawling and bustling Philadelphia plays host to a conspiracy sandwich, with a corking side order of the film making process. Sometimes bleak and complex (how great it is to find a true noir finale), but never over stuffed, Blow Out is both thrilling and smart, while Travolta has never been better and John Lithgow is tailor made as the unstoppable crack-pot unleashed into our two protagonists' world. 9/10"

It was only when I read about this film that I realized that the characters had been taken from that literary universe and from a line of action toys created by the American company Mattel. This is something that helped me to understand the sheer confusion and goofiness of this film, which I think only toy fans will truly appreciate.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this movie is the cast. There are some very respectable actors here, and their commitment and talent is remarkable, raising the quality of a cheesy movie quite a bit. Frank Langella's involvement is particularly good. He gave life to the great villain, a being called Skeletor, who looks like Darth Vader in the day he decided to go to Halloween dressed as Death. The character himself isn't impressive, he's a huge cliché without any intimidation ability, but Langella is really enjoying and having fun with this work. On the opposite side is Dolph Lundgren, a herculean and apparently invulnerable young man who came out of the world of combat sports, who doesn't know how to play and has the dramatic qualities of an avocado, but who manages to respond to what is asked of the character. Meg Foster, the proud owner of one of the most beautiful pairs of eyes of her time, has a charisma of her own and does a very good work.\r\n\r\nBut let's be honest, is anyone going to see a movie just for the cast? I do not think so. It's a good argument, but it doesn't take anyone to the theatre by itself. Does the movie have anything else? Do you have qualities? Is it really worth it? There are audiences for all types of cinema, including kitsch, trash and B cinema. The proof of this is the success of some films that would never convince a person with the least amount of good taste. Therefore, I believe that lovers of “oily sci-fi” will be delighted with this magnificent piece of cheese with a very characteristic taste of the 80s. We have everything: stilted action scenes, choreographed like a Russian ballet, extraordinarily cheap special effects, “DIY” level, a very poor script, characters reduced to sketches, dialogues more melodramatic than a Mexican soap opera, crude make-up (Langella's mask is particularly bad) and many laser shots, in the golden age of lasers and neon. One last word for the soundtrack, bloated and arrogant like a 16-year-old on steroids."

Michael is on his way to finish the job he couldn't finish two decades ago.\r\n\r\nA true and honest Halloween/Michael Myers film this one, there's the distinct feeling that the people behind the series wanted to show that they remember what made the series popular in the first place. It's still the stalk and slash formula of course, but Jamie Lee Curtis returns and her character is nicely written. She's obviously still haunted by events passed and needs a stiff few drinks from time to time to keep the edge off. Yet she's in charge of a private school and is a stern but adoring mother to her son (Josh Hartnett). And she has a boyfriend (Adam Arkin) who cares for her.\r\n\r\nThe first half of film sets up Laurie's new world, while we jump back and forth observing Michael on his journey to final destination. Once the second half revs up, it's the scare time as Laurie's son and his friends come under great peril, which we know will lead to a final confrontation with Laurie. The kills strike hard, the suspense is ramped up, and then it's a frenetic action based finale capped off by a coup de grace of some distinction. All in all it's just a very good and proper Halloween/Myers movie. It didn't reinvent anything, it just turned the wheel full circle and arrived at a fitting closure. 7/10"

It’s Halloween season and her son (Josh Hartnett) is turning 17. Will her evil brother show-up to wreak terror once again? Of course he will. Adam Arkin, LL Cool J and Janet Leigh have side roles.\r\n\r\n“Halloween 4” (1988) was great and IMHO even better than the original 1978 slasher while “Halloween 5” (1989) was good, although it added a little campy humor. The next film, “Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers” (1995), was surprisingly a mess with weak characters, lousy story development and stale & pedestrian jump scares. So I didn’t know what to expect with 1998’s “Halloween H2O: 20 Years Later.”\r\n\r\nThe movie starts in Illinois with a glimmer of humor and the final scene of the character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt made me bust out laughing. From there, the tone turns dramatic as events switch to the posh boarding school in California. The characters are confidently established and we feel we know them as Michael Myers stages his assault.\r\n\r\nI’m glad the creators decided to finally switch the setting from Haddonfield, Illinois, to a wholly different locale across the country. Haddonfield was getting tired. The plot is similar to “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,” which was released a few months later. “H2O” is arguably the second best sequel in the series after 4 and is at least on par with 5.\r\n\r\nIt’s great to have Jamie Lee as the ‘final girl’ again. Michelle Williams also appears on the female front. She was only 17 during shooting and cute as can be. The attractive Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is also on hand.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 26 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (La Puente, Silver City, Chatsworth, Calabasas, Universal City and Los Angeles).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

But to reach such heights and to have such ambition--as well as undeniable talent--is a victory in and of itself. Just armed with the main five actors alone, at the zenith of their craft, a fine script (really the first interesting and well-deliberated Vietnam film to hit the big screen) and Vilmos Zsigmond behind the camera meant that this would prove something special. Scenes that will haunt you forever. My favourite shot is the incredible 360-degree pan shot around Linda's bedroom when she realizes she's given up on Nick and is going to declare her love to Michael--extraordinary stuff. What's YOURS?\r\n\r\nMany film lovers who despise Cimino's work instantly clam up when 'The Deer Hunter' is mentioned...and there's a reason for that.

Betuel. It stars Lance Guest, Robert Preston, Catherine Mary Stewart, Dan O'Herlihy and Norman Snow. Music is by Craig Safan and cinematography by King Baggot. Story sees Guest as Alex Rogan, an everyday teenage boy who upon breaking the high-score record on a trailer park arcade game, suddenly finds himself recruited by an alien defence unit to fight an evil army out in space. \r\n\r\nThe advancements of computers and all their devilish electronic off shoots have rendered many of the pioneering effects films of yesteryear as rudimentary antiques. Where once films like \"Tron\" and \"The Last Starfighter\" blazed the trail that many would follow over the years, now they seem, if you believe the multitude of new era reviews for them, to hold only nostalgia value to video game players who were still at school in the early 1980's. That's something of a disservice, for although they do indeed rely in the main on effects work and razz dazzle 80's credibility, the stories are enjoyably fantastical and not without thought and merit. \r\n\r\nThe Last Starfighter is one of the better ones because it manages to be both an exciting and sweet picture, one that is completely disarming. Certainly it marries Spielberg homespun values with George Lucas operatics, but in the form of its teen protagonist it also dots the fantasy canvas with angsty worth. So much so that now when one revisits the film with older eyes, we can appreciate more fully that young Alex is in a rut, the crossroads of his life, a life he's struggling to make sense of. Also more appreciation can now be made of the relationship Alex has with Grig (O'Herlihy), his flight navigator up in the galaxy, someone whom he calls a Gung-Ho iguana! This relationship is nicely drawn, here is where Alex finds not only his friend, but also his father figure, something he doesn't have the privilege of down on Earth.\r\n\r\nWhilst up there fighting an intergalactic battle, Alex on Earth has been replaced by a Replicant Beta Model to ensure he is not missed. Here is where much of the film's fun is gleaned from. Interesting to note that originally this arc in the film wasn't to be that huge, but test screenings encouraged director Castle into a rethink. And the film is the better for it as the Beta tries to keep the flame going with the girlfriend (Stewart adorable girl next door type) and ensure he's not found out by any Ko-Dan spies! Here Guest earns his corn, it's a very good duel performance from the youngster and it's a shame his career never really took off post the film's release. \r\n\r\nHowever, none of this means the film is full of depth, it still remains a very simple story full of fantastical incredulity. But the underlying message of improving oneself, not settling for second best, is rich and puts some potency in the narrative. Still, it's safe to say that most tuning into The Last Starfighter want whizz bang space adventure frolics, which thankfully we do get. The effects are of course variable, though not as cheap looking in High Definition as one expected, while the action is nicely constructed by Castle and his team. The villains led by a Po-faced Norman Snow make their mark, while Robert Preston, a legend to Western and film noir fans in the 40's and 50's, gives a wonderfully sweet and affecting turn as Centauri, the game inventor who whisks Alex away to the planet Rylos for his life changing challenge. \r\n\r\nMore than just a film for nostalgists and gamer types, Last Starfighter is pretty solid entertainment from its core to the outer layers. 7/10"

However, I have some doubts about the quality of the films it spawned.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the film begins by showing us a young teenager addicted to a gaming machine who, after beating the last levels of the game, is taken in a futuristic car by a stranger to discover that everything the machine showed was real, and it was in reality true training to find and recruit space pilots for a war in a faraway galaxy, in the best “Star Wars” style. Of course, the movie also has a hormone-filled romance in the middle.\r\n\r\nUpon seeing the film, I was a little skeptical about the script and its verisimilitude, but after a bit of reading, I came to discover that, nowadays, there are a lot of digital military systems, and even weaponry, that are made in such a way that be more easily controlled by soldiers who have already had some contact with computer games, and have some dexterity with this type of entertainment. This is something quite ingenious, and also perverse, on equal measures: ingenious because of their pragmaticism, perverse because it puts \"innocent\" video games on an equal footing with real weapons, which destroy and kill real people. Philosophies aside, the film seems to me more accessible and more interesting than others of the same genre and from the same era. The script isn't particularly clever, and it's not difficult to predict the course of events, but it does things reasonably effectively.\r\n\r\nThe cast is not the strong point of the film. We don't have any major actors involved here, and the whole movie looks like it was made with fairly amateur actors. Lance Guest was credible in the role of the hero, and he does what he needs to, but without great competence and in a relatively weak way. Robert Preston is a little better, but he doesn't have much to do other than be the movie's Yoda. Catherine Mary Stewart appears simply because someone thought the hero had to have a minimally attractive girlfriend.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film bets heavily on cinematography, which is reasonably well done, and on good visual and sound effects, which do their job well and look realistic, even if they are a huge distance from what we can do today, which makes the film quite dated but still nice."

It's quite a fun fantasy adventure this, Guest joins in wholeheartedly as does Preston and there are plenty of special effects to drown out the occasionally boo-hiss romantic elements with \"Maggie\" (Catherine Mary Stewart). There is plenty of humour, too - mostly from Preston and Guest makes for an easy on the eye hero for all to get behind. It's actually stood the test of time quite well, as many simple ideas do, and I really quite enjoyed it."

It lacks the class of other Disney animation movies, with no songs of note to tap the feet to, but the action is strong (love the archery), Prince John and Sir Hiss are great comedy value, and ultimately it’s a delightful retelling of an often told wonderful legend. 8/10"

Everyone knows the story of Robin Hood - the gent of 12th century English folklore. When the King heads off to fight the Saracens in the crusades, his evil brother remains to extort all he can from the poor population whilst Robin Hood leads the rebellion against this tyrannical regime. The personifications of animals in this film is a masterstroke - and the choice of animals: a snake, fox, bear, lion, badger and even a tortoise all add hugely to the symbolism and fun of this thoroughly enjoyable rendering of the ultimate good v evil tale. I always seem to have a problem with the intrusive scores in Disney's animations - it never seems to let up long enough to let the voices take centre stage, and as such is quite distracting much of the times. That said, I am nit-picking - aside from a rather protracted musical interlude - the action animations are first class and this is a cracking film."

Sadly there's no psychological depth given the two boys by writer Tony Gayton, which renders the whole motives and means, and the investigation of such, as being a shallow exercise in thriller film making.\r\n\r\nRunning at two hours in length doesn't help matters, because this further irritates that more meat was not written onto Gosling and Pitt's bones, while it also exposes just how hackneyed and clichéd the picture is.

I've rarely seen a potentially decent ensemble cast wasted like this. Bullock just isn't at the races, her character is frankly really quite boring and the rapport with the out of his depth Chaplin just doesn't work. There is the glimmer of an homo-erotic relationship between Gosling and the always enigmatic Pitt, but I think maybe that is just because my brain was scrabbling around trying to find a reason to make it through this really disappointing feature. In the end it is a battle of wills, and those who seem to hold all the aces play their hand as if their arms had been amputated; serendipity plays way too big a part in the denouement and at just shy of two hours, I found myself looking out of the window at the seagulls more than I might have liked.

        "content": "_**Masterpiece**_\r\n\r\nHow \"Runaway Train\" bombed at the box office in December, 1985, I'll never know because it's the perfect blend of blockbuster thrills and weighty subtext.\r\n\r\nThe story involves Manny (Jon Voight), a notorious prison hero, who escapes a maximum security prison in the frozen wastelands of Alaska. He is joined by a naive follower (Eric Roberts) and they stow away on a train consisting of four locomotives, but the train runs away. Meanwhile, the arrogant warden (John P. Ryan) is on the warpath for Manny.\r\n\r\n\"Runaway Train\" is such a powerful experience because it's much more than just a mindless action flick, as the title would suggest. The thrilling events are actually a stage for a fascinating study of the human condition. Manny is a hardened convict who's \"at war with the world and everyone in it.\" When called an animal he replies, \"No, worse -- human!\"\r\n\r\nThis is a man who wants one thing, freedom, but he knows that he's too far gone to make it in conventional society. He shares a parable with his dumb partner, made up on the spot, about having a menial job and submitting to the boss even though you might want to rip his throat out. This is the key to making it in society -- submitting to authority and resisting the rage within; and then getting your check on payday and enjoying the fruits thereof. Manny wishes he could do this, but knows he can't. So what hope is there for him in modern society? If he can't do that then why's he escaping prison? In other words, Manny knows there's no hope for him, even if his escape is successful. To him, freedom can only come one way. I don't believe this, but I understand why he believes it.\r\n\r\nThere's another potent scene where Manny has a knife and mercilessly comes against his own \"partner\". You see the rage on his face, like a cornered animal. After intense emotions are vented Manny suddenly realizes... and then he just bows over, utterly spent. A character, who should be afraid of him, somehow understands and compassionately reaches out in a semi-embrace.\r\n\r\nPowerful scenes like these are combined with surreal images of the misshapen locomotives barreling down the tracks in the freezing wilderness accompanied by the ominous score by Trevor Jones. Some parts of the score scream mid-80s, but other parts are timeless.\r\n\r\nRebecca De Mornay has an atypical role as a railroad worker who stumbles on to the convicts. She intuitively sees through their macho posturing. Although she knows they're desperate & dangerous, she also sees that they're not wholly evil. Roberts is basically a kid at heart and Manny is just blinded by the incredible rage within. He's only irredeemable because of his stupid pride, built up over years of hardened confinement.\r\n\r\nVoight is near unrecognizable as Manny and Roberts is just superb as his dumb sidekick. These two along with De Mornay are examples of acting at its finest.\r\n\r\nJohn P. Ryan is very effective as the machismo warden Ranken, but his Captain Ahab-like role comes off too comic booky to be plausible. Yet Ranken shows that you can be an \"animal\" on the outside of prison just as much as on the inside. Both Manny and Ranken are corrupted by pride, but Manny at least knows it. And he's not too far gone to recognize those who are worthy of life and to respond accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe film was shot in Montana (Anaconda & Deer Lodge) and Alaska (Whittier & Portage) and runs 1 hour, 51 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A+"

After a film far weaker than any of its predecessors, I had hoped that attempts had been made to improve things a little. However, this film is at least as weak as its immediate predecessor. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie, quite the opposite. There are much worse and much better rated films out there, and the comedy of this film is quite friendly and familiar, unlike what happens in many other comic films, where the humor is pure and simply dirty. This is an enjoyable movie and sometimes even has some fun… it's just not as good as its predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe script is based on a series of attempts to stop a group of bandits from carrying out a series of crimes and robberies in a certain area of ​​the city. Obviously, Lassard and Harris will be together to do it, and Harris is only concerned with his own career progression and continues to be the preferred target of the cop trolls we already know. The script is not brilliant, but it manages to support the film in the way it was conceived and executed. It turns out that the quality level is now very low, and this can also be seen in the poverty of the dialogues, in the amount of clichés and situations that, instead of making us laugh, make us wonder to what extent the screenwriter was a competent person.\r\n\r\nThe cast does what they can with what they've been given, but they don't have the space or material to stand out anyway. Bubba Smith assumes an unquestionable protagonism, but he doesn't have a character or even material that makes him stand out more. Michael Winslow does what he can, but he doesn't stand out much either. Easterbrook and Ramsey are a shadow of what they were in other films. Matt McCoy is no joke and shouldn't be here. Villains can be more idiotic and childish than the Looney Tunes and George Gaynes, as respectable as he is, turned his character into an old man with no memory or sense of the ridiculous. Who is still standing out in some way is G.W. Bailey, but this happens mainly because of the ridiculous situations in which he ends up involved.\r\n\r\nTechnically, there isn't much to say about this film. It seeks to maintain the characteristics and visual aspect of its predecessors, with standard cinematography, conventional editing and few notable effects, in addition to the shots and some interesting situations, such as the one in which Tackleberry writes with his machine gun. Everything else is simply more of the same and doesn't deserve a specific mention."

        "content": "Bound for the promised land, indeed.\r\n\r\nOne of the last great epic movies to come out of MGM that was a roaring success, How the West Was Won still has enough quality about it to warrant high praise. The story that drives the film on was suggested by the series of the same name that featured in \"Life\" magazine 1959. Narrative is formed around one family, the Prescott's, who set out on a journey West in 1839. They and their offspring fill out five segments of film that are directed by three different men, \"The Rivers\", \"The Plains\" & \"The Outlaws\" is under the guidance of Henry Hathaway, and \"The Civil War\" by John Ford and \"The Railroad\" by George Marshall. \r\n\r\nFilmed in the unique Cinerama format, which in a nutshell is three cameras filming at once to project a fully formed experience for the human eye, the production has an all star cast and four supreme cinematographers aiding the story. To name all the cast would take forever, but in the main all of the major parts were filled by stars who had already headlined a movie previously. The cinematographers are naturally key since such a sprawling story inevitably has sprawling vistas, they come up trumps with some truly special work: William H. Daniels, Milton Krasner, Charles Lang Jr. & Joseph LaShelle, four great names who help to make the film a poetic beauty.\r\n\r\nAs a whole it's undeniably far from flawless, complaints such as it running out of steam towards the end (the irony of it since a steam train features prominently), and the plot contrivances, are fair enough. However, when the film is good, it's real good: raft in the rapids, Cheyene attack, buffalo stampede and train robbery, each of them are good enough to be a highlight in separate movies. Even the songs are pleasant, particularly when they revolve around the effervescent Debbie Reynolds, while home format transfers are now finally up to a standard worthy of investment, time and cash wise.\r\n\r\nHard to dislike for a Western fan, and carrying enough about it to lure in the casual viewer, How the West Was Won really is a case of they don't make them like they used to. 8/10"

        "content": "_**Unique, entertaining all-star Western epic comprised of vignettes is a mixed bag**_\r\n\r\nReleased in 1962-63 and written by James Webb, \"How the West was Won\" is an epic Hollywood Western covering fifty years between 1839-1889 focusing on the Prescott family's move West and narrated by Spencer Tracy. This is a history lesson amped up with melodrama, romance, adventure, violence and song & dance.\r\n\r\nThe film was done in Cinerama, which was a short-lived cinematic experiment involving three synchronized projectors and a huge curved screen. Only one other film with a traditional story line utilized this process, \"The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm,\" released the same year. Cinerama was invented so film could keep ahead of its growing rival, television, but it proved too expensive and cumbersome. Despite this, \"How the West was Won\" was a huge success at the box office.\r\n\r\nThere were epic Westerns before and after, of course, like \"The Big Country\" (1958), \"The Alamo\" (1960), \"Dances with Wolves\" (1990) and \"Wyatt Earp\" (1994). What separates \"How the West was Won\" is that it's split into five vignettes directed by three different directors, as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE RIVERS (1839), directed by Henry Hathaway. This opening segment may turn off viewers with its eye-rolling \"Disney Goes West\" vibe and the corresponding corny dialogue, particularly the lightning fast romance that starts between Linus Rawlings (James Stewart) and Eve Prescott (Carroll Baker). But, if you can endure past such cringe-worthy moments, there's a sudden shift when the travelers run into a malevolent gang of river pirates (Walter Brennan, Lee Van Cleef and cutie Brigid Bazlen). The switch from quaint family-friendly material to nigh shocking violence is notable. One villain gets an ax wung into his back and another a knife into his chest (!). The episode ends with a thrilling fatal rafting sequence. Karl Malden plays the patriarch while Debbie Reynolds plays the less-romantic sister. I must say that the producers knocked it out of the ballpark by featuring Baker, Reynolds and Bazlen in the female department; all three are breathtaking.\r\n\r\nTHE PLAINS (1851), directed by Henry Hathaway. Lilith Prescott (Reynolds) ends up in St. Louis as a dance hall performer where she learns she's inherited a gold mine in California. A handsome gambler (Gregory Peck) catches wind and tags along on the wagon train, led by a character played by the great Robert Preston. Both guys want the babe, but only the latter seems sincere, which curiously doesn't interest Lilith. This segment is highlighted by Reynold's beauty and her entertaining song & dance sequences and a thrilling Cheyanne attack on the wagon train.\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL WAR (1861-1865), directed by John Ford. This segment starts at the Prescott homestead in Ohio where the son of Lilith, Zeb (George Peppard), decides to join the Civil War, after his dad did a couple of years earlier. This is the weakest of the vignettes because the scenes where Ulysses Grant (Harry Morgan) and General Sherman (John Wayne) hang out are obviously studio bound and, worse, the Shiloh battle sequence is almost non-existence. What a letdown!\r\n\r\nTHE RAILROAD (1868), directed by George Mashall. After the war Lieutenant Zeb gets a gig in the U.S. Cavalry, trying to maintain peace with the Indians while befriending grizzled buffalo hunter Jethro Stuart (Henry Fonda), but Zeb becomes disillusioned when an arrogant railroad mogul (Richard Widmark) violates treaties with the Arapaho by building in their territories. The Natives retaliate by stampeding bison through the railroad camp and killing many. It's an impressive sequence.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTLAWS (1889) directed by Henry Hathaway. Widowed, Lilith moves from San Francisco to her remaining asset, an Arizona ranch, inviting Zeb (Peppard) and his wife (Carolyn Jones) & kids to oversee it. But Marshal Zeb is threatened by a vengeful outlaw (Eli Wallach). Instead of waiting for the thug to strike, Zeb goes on the offensive with the help of reluctant Marshal Lou Ramsey (Lee J. Cobb). They hide out on a train with an unusually large gold shipment to ambush the outlaw and his gang. The exciting climax is impressive for its time and obviously influential in action-oriented cinema.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the movie is a series of thinly-connected stories with a few characters carrying over to other segments (Baker, Reynolds, Peck, Peppard). It's a big film rather than a great one. But you have to respect its uniqueness and the fact that it pulls out all the stops to entertain on so many levels. The score by Alfred Newman, for instance, is one of the all-time best film compositions. While the movie sometimes disappoints — particularly the opening \"Disney goes West\" vibe and the truncated Civil War sequence — there's just too much good here to give it a bad grade. You just have to be willing to acclimate to its quirks and uniqueness. Needless to say, don't expect a conventional Western because \"How the West was Won\" is anything but.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 164 minutes and was shot in Kentucky & Illinois in the East; and South Dakota, Utah, Arizona, California and Oregon in the West .\r\n\r\nGRADE: B\r\n"

From the opening bars of Alfred Newman's score, you can rest assured that we are in for something grand - and, cinematographically speaking, we certainly are. The story is essentially episodic in nature, depicting three stages in the lives of families who emigrate west, encountering just about every obstacle and danger imaginable as the gold rush, railroads (and robbers!), Indians, civil war - and the terrain - challenge even the most adaptable and determined of families. Debbie Reynolds provides some early camp-fire entertainment with a rousing rendition of Sammy Cahn's \"Home in the Meadow\" that sets the scene as they traverse the wilderness. No point listing the stars, it would be easier to list the ones who didn't take part - but there are some notable efforts from Karl Malden and Jimmy Stewart as our journey begins; George Peppard has a distinct glint in his eye, Henry Fonda \"Jethro\" - and Richard Widmark also adds a bit of character as the hard-nosed railroad man \"King\". The ageing processes are less well managed, the application of some grey dye to Reynolds and Peppard is so obvious as to question it's necessity - we know many years have elapsed, this just seems to exaggerate what we are quiet capable of imagining. The writing benefits from one hand at the tiller (there were three directors and as many on the photography); with some frequently pithy, earthy dialogue well delivered by the plethora of acting talent. It's 2¾ hours long, this - but we are carried along without much drudgery through their escapades, love stories, tragedies and sheer bloody-mindedness well. The narration from Spencer Tracy borders on the oozingly sentimental at times, especially with his epilogue but if you enjoy a good western, then this is hard to beat..."

The residents of Lago at first view the stranger with suspicion, but when news that some outlaws that are out for blood are on their way to town, they ask the stranger for his help. \r\n\r\nThis is Clint Eastwood's first Western film that he directed, and it's clear and evident that the guy not only loves the genre that made his name, he also knows what makes it work. Obviously having worked for Sergio Leone, Eastwood was making notes because High Plains Drifter oozes the mythical aura of many of Leone's finest genre offerings. To which, with thanks, the result is one of the best offerings in the 70s for the Oater enthusiast. \r\n\r\nThe film opens with our mysterious drifter slowly coming out of the beautiful sprawling haze and into Lago, it's ethereal, then there's just the sound of the horse breathing and the clop of its hooves that can be heard (the sound mix here is incredible), it's a gloriously mysterious opening that sets the tone perfectly. Yet Eastwood is just toying with us though, for a quick jolt of sex and violence snaps us out of the beatific warmth and into a quite hauntingly cold and morally challenged place. From here on in the stranger will demand all manner of odd things from the residents of Lago, he seems to be toying with them and revelling in their discomfort, with Lago quickly resembling an arid hellhole. You see, Lago has a dark secret, and our mysterious stranger has a purpose, and it's this purpose that makes High Plains Drifter an intriguing and gripping experience. \r\n\r\nA well known fact now is that the great man of the genre, John Wayne, wrote Eastwood to strongly complain about his harsh vision of the West, one can only think the Duke failed to grasp the post Vietnam feel of a 70s made Western. It's a great directorial effort from Eastwood, more so when you marry up his acting performance to his directorial duties. Very much the perfect role, it lets Eastwood accentuate his rugged Western leanings. Eastwood would direct the similarly themed Pale Rider in the 80s and then the genre crown topper Unforgiven in the 90s. A Western great in each decade? Well that will always be debatable, but what we do know is that the Western genre was considerably lucky to have had such a man to keep the genre going for the newer interested wanderers into the Wild West. \r\n\r\nBeautifully photographed (Bruce Surtees) on the shores of Mono Lake, California, it's a film pungent with sex, sadism, retribution and risks. High Plains Drifter is mystical and magnificent and essential Western fare. 9/10"

Geoffrey Lewis, a frequent castmate of Eastwood's, is the best of the rest, if I had to pick.

Makes sense? Not if you're looking for credible motivation.\r\nBut credible motivation isn't a part of most of Eastwood's Westerns. Certainly not the spaghetti ones.\r\nSo, the rest of the movie is just sound and fury, signifying nothing, and don't try to make sense out of any of it. It's just another movie about homicidal maniacs being everywhere. If the West or East or anywhere was anything like this, there wouldn't be anyone left in one piece to keep a town going. They'd all either be dead or crippled.\r\nBut Eastwood loved to be in that sort of thing. A hundred years from now, he'll be remembered for many good Westerns like Hang Em High and Joe Kidd, and his Rawhid series, and Dirty Harry, because he played credible characters in those. \r\nHe doesn't do that here."

This is done through a small handful of characters: Marko and Blacky are friends, but follow different life paths: one becomes a kind of boss of the Communist Party, the other the head of a clandestine arms factory, which helps the another to get rich\r\n\r\nDirected by Emir Kusturica, it's a rather surreal and hard-to-understand film that feels like it was made for a niche audience that I don't belong to. There is something deeply cynical about all this, especially if we consider the critical way in which the director thought of the film: it is a film that does not bother to explain historical events, presumes that we already know them, and works on them in order to criticize the way we look at war heroes.\r\n\r\nI honestly prefer not to talk too much about the cast because I don't know any of those involved. Anyway, I feel they did a pretty satisfying job, considering the film it is and what the director wanted to do. The script has a lot of black humor, sometimes of debatable taste, and there are a number of issues that, if we think about it, make us question the plausibility of the script. For example, how is it possible for a group of people to stay hidden underground for so long without knowing what is going on in the world around them. It does not make sense.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has excellent sets and a very well achieved cinematography. The editing is, however, a little poorly done as the film fails to maintain a regular pace, with several scenes too long. But what tired and irritated me the most was the strident soundtrack, dominated by a brass band and songs, with an adequate Slavic sound, but exaggeratedly strong and flashy."

This woman is prone to vivid dreams set many centuries earlier, where she lives happily with her parents (and without her dull as ditchwater sister) and where she is regular regaled with portentous stories by her grandmother (Angela Lansbury). It's in one such dream, and whilst walking through the woods to visit her elderly relative that she encounters a handsome and enigmatic young man who wants to bet who will reach the old woman's house first! She is intrigued, but is she prepared for the true identity of her admirer? Though the story is a bit staccato at times, but this is still a rich and vividly constructed adaptation of a story that mixes romance, fable and a soupçon of horror cleverly and entertainingly - whilst subtly presenting an undercurrent of emerging sexuality. Sure, some of the effects are not what they might be and the stylised presentation doesn't always work, but the storytelling of \"Granny\" and some of her warnings about the path, the fruit and about a chap whose eyebrows meet in the middle are engagingly delivered by an on form, and ideally cast Lansbury. A solid supporting cast and a rich score from George Fenton make for quite an enjoyable and creative interpretation of a well trodden story, and I quite enjoyed watching it."

        "content": "There seems to be a never-ending feud between many horror fans regarding 'Suspiria', due to the fact that this film is considered Dario Argento's outstanding masterpiece. Personally, I'm completely against the idea of praising something that you don't actually like, so I respect anyone who thinks that this movie is overrated or even plain awful. My summary is only an opinion, but by no means I intend to make people change their mind or disapprove their concept of this film.\r\n\r\n'Suspiria' is one of the many Italian horror films that came out during the late 70s and early 80s, that is extremely criticized for having a supposedly questionable plot and denouement. If we compare this movie to some of the other popular films directed by Dario Argento, we're probably going to think that 'Suspiria', is perhaps not as intriguing or well developed, when it comes to the story. To give a few examples of some of the Argento films that are widely considered the actual masterpieces because they offer an intriguing plot, good imagery and well done endings, I would probably name 'The Bird with the Crystal Plumage', 'Deep Red' and 'The Cat o' Nine Tails'. So what is it that we should believe? Nothing! Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and even though I agree with those who claim that 'Suspiria' is Argento's real masterpiece, I would never waste my time trying to convince people that this is true. As a matter of fact, I'll be honest and say that I also believe that 'Suspiria' has a somehow underdeveloped story, but I still regard it as one of the best horror movies in history. The reason is simple: in my opinion, you can make something wonderful, without a wonderful plot. This is perhaps one of the most visually enchanting horror movies I have seen so far and I honestly doubt I will ever find another film that can enchant me as much as this one. Everything about 'Suspiria' is beautiful, even the violent deaths. I know this may sound sick and disgusting, but I believe Mr. Argento has the special gift to make beautiful images out of gruesome situations, like murder, for example. From the beginning until the end, this film takes us to a dark dreamland with beautiful contrasting colors, eerie locations and a recurrent unsettling music. The locations are perfect. The ballet school in which the story takes place, seems to be a nonexistent place taken from someone's dream. Indeed, it was revealed once that 'Suspiria' was partly inspired by a dream that Daria Nicolodi once had (Mrs. Nicolodi was the co-writer and Argento's girlfriend at the time). So if the idea was to create a dream-like movie, I would say they did a perfect job. Everything about 'Suspiria' looks surreal and charming. It's a dark fairy tale, in which the characters behave in a childish way, like playing along with the scenario. It is also said that the actresses were initially supposed to be little girls, but fearing that the film could be banned, Argento had to choose older actresses, but he didn't really change much of the dialogs, which I think is genius. Strangely, the characters don't come off as moronic or anything, they simply are strange and childish, but in a good way. The subject of sex, for example, is barely even mentioned, which is something that doesn't happen too often in horror movies with twenty-something year old characters. But regarding the actors who played these characters, I would mostly compliment the work of the late actresses Joan Bennett and Alida Valli. The young cast was simply fine, but no one did a remarkable job. Not even Jessica Harper, who was a bad choice for the lead character, in my opinion. This is probably the only little detail I would criticize about this film. Mrs. Harper pretty much has the same facial expression and tone of voice throughout the entire film, which is not good. On the other hand, like I said before, Mrs. Valli and Mrs. Bennett were flawless as the two bitter old women who run the school with their awful temper and their little psychological tortures against those who stand in their ways.\r\n\r\nSo concluding: 'Suspiria' is one of those films that you either love or hate. Both feelings are equally respectable and I can understand why some people don't really appreciate it. But if I have to recommend or 'sell' this movie to someone, I would definitely highlight the dream-like imagery and the creepy music composed by The Goblins, that go perfectly well with what is seen on the screen. Enjoy this dark fairy tale about witches and childish girls."

Nothing will ever come close to this movie’s cinematography and soundtrack. Many people comment on the ‘style over substance’ aspect of Suspiria (and some of Argento’s other films), but I don’t see it as a flaw. It’s an experience. I don’t care if everything makes 100% perfect sense, when I put Suspiria on I feel transported to another world and that’s the best kind of movie. One that can just take you away from the real world. \r\n\r\nSuspiria is oddly comforting to me. I guess it’s that taking me away from the world feeling. It feels like a hug which I know isn’t what Argento was going for, but hey, apparently people ran out of theatres screaming in the 70s and I’m just a freak.\r\n\r\nWould recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I can’t imagine not liking it. I get that the dubbing and the cinematography or whatever may be a little jarring at first as beautiful it is, but go in with an open mind and let yourself get lost in the beautiful world of Suspiria and I can’t see anyone at least not somewhat liking it.\r\n\r\nNothing I could ever say could sum up how much I truly love this movie."

Regrettably, it’s the least of these. There’s nothing wrong with the cast or technical filmmaking as the gore, F/X and swamp sets are fine, although the ‘monster’ make-up looks kinda cartoonish (which fits the genre).\r\n\r\nWhile it’s relatively amusing and occasionally funny, it’s hindered by an odious raunchy air right out of the gate. For instance, the two supposedly hot girls flash their breasts every 5 minutes in the first half hour. Don’t take that as prudish, I’m just pointing out that a movie is questionable when it goes overboard with female nudity to hide its deficiencies. Meanwhile the heroine played by Amara Zaragoza is interesting, but she has little sex appeal, although that’s a matter of taste.\r\n\r\nI could handle those flaws if the story was more compelling and the humor more amusing, yet that’s not the case. Although the plot is great, the script needed a rewrite to flesh out better prospects. But that takes time & money and the flick only cost 1.5 million, which is almost six times LESS than what “Club Dread” cost.\r\n\r\nI should add that Kane Hodder plays the Jason-like antagonist while Robert Englund has a cameo in the opening.     \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, with a longer version running an additional 9 minutes. It was shot in New Orleans (Mardi Gras sequences) with the swamp scenes done in a convincing indoor set at Sable Ranch, Santa Clarita, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-/D+"

Shirley MacLaine is great alongside Mr. Eastwood, she suits and plays her character extremely well. The two have excellent chemistry. Elsewhere, Manolo Fábregas spearheads the rest.\r\n\r\nHow about that score? I love it! Impossible not to tap along to whenever the main title is used and every single time it sounds so, so good. Ennio Morricone, what a ledge! The humour in this 1970 film is also top notch, while the pacing and editing is also on point. I really enjoyed the journey that the plot takes, it's simple and there's a clear beginning, middle and end but it's all supremely entertaining.\r\n\r\nI will no doubt be revisiting this!"

Once it gets going, though, it's one of the best crime thrillers I've seen in ages. It all centres around the kidnapping of a small boy for whom the anger-prone, shoe millionaire \"Gondo\" (a strong contribution from Toshirô Mifune) is supposed to pay a ransom of ¥30 million - a colossal sum. It turns out, though, that it's not his son who has been snatched - it's the child of his chauffeur. Why ought he to pay? Will he just get on with his impending company takeover or will he risk bankruptcy for the young \"Shinichi\"? This is a film split into three sections. The first deals with the decision making process around will he/won't he/why should he. Next, the police must try to apprehend this individual. This process is meticulously carried out and Kurosawa has chosen to immerse us in some of that detail, rather than just cursorily skip through it. This makes the whole detection process a much more interesting part of the film; allowing some aspects of the characterisation of the police officers to develop and also introducing some dark humour to the proceedings. Finally, we reach the denouement with it's own rather curious and not entirely explicable agenda. There's an element of \"what would you do?\", there's a grim depiction of a seamier side of Japanese (heroin-fuelled) culture that we seldom get to see and there is a rather starkly effective dose of humanity presented here as the story juggles aspects of human nature, nurture and good old fashioned greed in quite an effective fashion. It's based on an Ed McBain book (which I haven't read) but the entire project has been successfully subsumed into it's guest culture for a gripping and detailed mystery that flies by."

Instead of cabin-in-the-woods, it’s a manor-in-the-woods flick, but don’t expect over-the-top slasher antics (e.g. silent masked killer with a machete), as this one’s more low-key and realistic, albeit saddled with eye-rolling thriller/horror clichés.\r\n\r\nIf you can roll with that flaw and a laughably executed snake sequence, this is pretty much on par with “What Lies Beneath” and “The Messengers” although it lacks the artistry of “Undertow.” Stephen Dorff is outstanding and the movie brings to life the small town/rural area with the residents thereof. People criticize the casting of gruff Dennis Quaid as a “wuss,” but he’s not a wuss; he’s just not rash because he knows a reckless social mistake can bring life-changing tragedy in seconds. Most other nitpicks can be just as easily explained. For instance, a person can’t very well push someone into a well if they’re no longer in the area.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot at Cruickston Park, Cambridge, Ontario, and places nearby in the Kitchener/Cambridge region with studio stuff done in Toronto, which is just an hour’s drive east.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

        "content": "I always had a bit of a crush on Stephen Dorff, and his topless torso helps this start off quite promisingly. Sadly, that is the undoubted highlight in this otherwise really poor horror mystery. \"Cooper\" (Dennis Quaid) and his wife \"Leah\" (Sharon Stone) take their kids from the city to live in an old rural manor house. It needs a bit of work, and they hire in the son of the former owner \"Dale\" (Dorff) to help out. That's mistake number one as we quickly discover that this house might not be the family's most shrewd purchase. Mike Figgis tries quite hard to build and sustain a sense of menace here, but he is completely let down by a storyline that is far too thinly stretched and by a really lacklustre effort from both Stone and the really weak Quaid. It doesn't so much end, as just peter out - I couldn't have cared less about any of them and once Dorff put his shirt on, my interest waned completely. An early outing for Kristen Stewart and a pointless one for Christopher Plummer (who didn't even have to get out of bed) add quite literally nothing to this mundane thriller that is really light on thrill."

        "content": "Never smile at a crocodile. Don't be taken in by his welcome grin.\r\n\r\nRogue is co-produced, written and directed by Greg Mclean (Wolf Creek). It stars Michael Vartan, Radha Mitchell, Sam Worthington & John Jarratt. The film is inspired by the true story of \"Sweetheart\", a giant Australian crocodile that terrorised boats in a 5 year period between 1974 & 1979. Plot sees travel journalist Pete McKell (Vartan) in the Northern Territory of Australia finishing off his latest feature. With time to kill he joins a river boat cruise led by spunky local lass Kate Ryan (Mitchell). So along with assorted other tourists, they set off up river. Where after a tricky encounter with a couple of local nuisances, one of the tourists spies a distress flare further up stream, then another, and another. As captain of the boat, Kate is duty bound to respond to aid anyone who may be in distress on the waters. However, this means straying into \"sacred waters\" and before they know it, they are in the middle of the hunting ground of a gigantic crocodile - who promptly attacks the boat and forces the group onto the nearest mini island, an island that is in tidal waters and the tide is coming in...\r\n\r\nUpon viewing Rouge it would seem that it may be one of the most unfortunate horror releases of the time. It barely got a theatrical release outside of its own country (practically one week in selected cinemas in America & Europe), and it came out at a time when killer-croc movies were appearing almost every other month; Primeval, Black Water and Lake Placid 2 (good grief) all \"surfaced\" (hrr hrr hrr) during 2007 to take a \"chomp\" (ok I'll stop now) of the movie watching public. This following on from the sub-genre of aquatic reptile horror movies already being well served by Steve Miner's Lake Placid (1999) & Lewis Teague's Alligator (1980), both of which have huge fan bases. It's all relevant because Rogue happens to be the best of the bunch, a snappy (sorry, couldn't resist), scary, fun and slickly produced Aussie movie. It's sickening that reams of sub-standard horror remakes get wide distribution whilst something like this, that deserves the chance at least, can't. The Weinstein Bothers should be ashamed of themselves for the treatment of Mclean's film.\r\n\r\nStraight away we should make clear that, as its certification suggests, Rouge is not particularly bloody. Those in need of sequence after sequence of a crocodile tearing humans limb from limb need not seek this film out. While it is in no way able to live with Lake Placid in terms of being \"intentionally\" humorous, thus comedy seekers should approach with caution, what Rogue does offer is a movie that's tightly structured and paced to precision. Packed with suspense, Mclean affords the characters some time to actually impact on the story. The first half hour is technically sublime, as we get to know the various folk on board the boat, we are treated to gorgeous cinematography from Will Gibson (location the estuaries of the Northern Territory), accompanied by one of the most pleasingly orchestral scores ever laid down for a creature feature (François Tetaz - with the nods to Jaws being just fine). All of this of course serves to offer up the calm before the inevitable storm, from where Mclean then follows the marker set by Jaws by not giving us full sight of the croc. It's the ultimate tease until the attacks start, but even then its mostly teasing suggestion, so the tension mounts as we couple it with our own imagination.\r\n\r\nWhat unfolds from here is a series of set pieces as our stranded group try to avoid becoming crocodile lunch. Here normally a film of this ilk shows dumb people doing dumb things, but Mclean shows respect to the genre and its fans by having some of these folk do silly yet understandable things, thus the scares are elicited by way of believable reactions. And of course the situation brings out the best and worst from most of them since peril has a funny way of doing this to a human being. Also of note here is that Mclean doesn't make the croc a monster, this is merely a hungry animal protecting its territory. A quick piece of dialogue earlier in the story had pointed to hunters possibly being the ones who fired the distress flares, as croc goes about his snarly way, it doesn't hurt to remember this pertinent fact. The cast all give credible performances, notably the handsome hero in waiting Vartan, Mitchell (who was becoming something of a screen queen darling back then) & Jarratt, who shows us a different string to his acting bow than the one he played as loony Mick Taylor in Wolf Creek.\r\n\r\nThe movie has flaws, but they are few and far between. The croc on appearance will irk some people, so it's true that Mclean could have done better there, while one \"WTF\" turn of events loses impact as the director isn't as bold to follow through like he did in Wolf Creek, but they are forgivable irks. For as we find ourselves holding our breaths during the creepy and practically silent finale, that culminates in a fine \"B\" movie bit of outrageousness, we realise that above all else it's been the suspense and ominous foreboding that made this one damn effective thriller. Mclean appeared to be holding a grudge against his native country, his first two films back then were hardly enticing the tourists to explore the gorgeous lands of Australia! What ever his means or motivation, long may it continue if he keeps producing films like this. Lets hope that his future projects are not as ignored as this one was, because for sure there is a very good director here and it would be tragic should a talent be burned by how his movie was handled.\r\n\r\nEvocative beauty blends with \"B\" movie thrills for a devilishly great time. 8/10"

Under threat to their families and themselves, both Jerry & Rachel must overcome the most hazardous of situations. Intriguingly everything around them seems to be controlled by the female voice that guides them, but just why is the FBI so hot on their tail?, does Jerry's twin brother hold the key?. All will be answered as our protagonists hurtle towards something that may have deadly consequences for America.\r\n\r\nBig Brother gets a reboot and delivers as fun a genre picture as was released in 2008. Yes it's total nonsense, but really the critics venting spleen on this one must have gone through a popcorn entertainment bypass prior to viewing it. Director D.J. Caruso continues his Hitckcockian leanings by following his surprisingly fun \"Disturbia\" with this \"North By Northwest\" type concept that meets a host of the genre staples, where the influences are very hard to miss. Yet as daft as it is, and it is folks, \"Eagle Eye\" knits well together to play out as a highly accomplished piece, the action is first rate, in fact on big screens the two main sequences explode with joyous action abandon. This isn't found wanting on the thriller front either, it's safe to say that no new ground is to be found as we get to the tick tock countdown finale, but Caruso, and writers John Glenn & Travis Wright, have spliced together a series of wholly interesting and thrilling strands. So much so that the finale is disappointingly unable to quite deliver on the promise of the prior build up.\r\n\r\nShia LaBeouf seemed destined to be a young actor who had to earn even the smallest bit of respect, where much like DiCaprio at the time, you felt LaBeouf was likely to get better notices later in his career. After being sidekicks to John McLaine, Indiana Jones, and erm, Optimus Prime, LaBeouf here earned his acting spurs and carries the film with a charm and credibility that the daftness of the piece doesn't quite deserve. Shia is helped enormously by a strong female lead, Michelle Monaghan has an impressive ability to sweat strength whilst channelling believable emotional turmoil, and her interplay with LaBeouf is the heartbeat of the picture. Of the rest, Michael Chiklis is a bit underused, but this is offset by Billy Bob Thornton continuing that knack of being one of the most watchable actors of his generation. Rosario Dawson is sadly weak in this and William Sadler is barely noticeable, conversely though a nod of approval goes to Anthony Mackie who shines in a crucial sequence towards the end.\r\n\r\nMy first viewing was when I went to the cinema with the then two ladies in my life, we were a bit early and sat in the foyer for a while, we watched as they were queuing out the door for \"High School Musical 3\" and weird looking people were trundling in to see \"Saw 5\". There were a total of 12 people in the cinema to see \"Eagle Eye\" on its second week run, at a peak viewing time as well. That was a damn shame because \"Eagle Eye\" may well be a dumb and fun action/thriller picture, but it's not pro-porting to be anything else, and really film's with honest entertainment intent are to be treasured and used for why they are made for in the first place. \"Eagle Eye\" is made for those who want to shut off from the world for a couple of hours, and in doing so have an energised blast in the process. 7.5/10"

I wouldn't say I enjoyed it or that it's that good, but it makes for an OK watch.\r\n\r\nThe casting is as obvious as possible. It features the likes of Terry Stone, Roland Manookian, Neil Maskell, Billy Murray, Kierston Wareing and Frank Harper - none of which are surprising to see, I'm more shocked Danny Dyer didn't appear. Ricci Harnett plays the lead role, he's alright.\r\n\r\nOne negative, though, about this 2007 film is Harnett's Carlton, who isn't likeable whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, the characters in these sorta films are always bad people but with ones like <em>'Green Street Hooligans'</em> or <em>'The Football Factory'</em>, there is at least a small reason to 'care' for the main character. I never did for Carlton, even at the end when it wants you to.\r\n\r\nOther negatives include the pacing, dialogue and overall story really. I will say it isn't anything that bored or irritated me, but there isn't much - if anything - that I liked either.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I'm still planning to watch the three sequels."

The character was so popular at the time that he inspired a black & white magazine as well (1989).\r\n\r\nThe reason The Punisher was and continues to be so popular is because he's essentially an over-the-top version of \"Dirty Harry\" and \"Deathwish\": Frank Castle's family is killed by the mob while on a picnic in Central Park and so he declares war on all criminals wherein he becomes their judge, jury and executioner. Unlike Daredevil, a lawyer who utilizes the justice system, The Punisher just kills 'em all.\r\n\r\nThe first movie version was 1989's \"The Punisher\" with Dolph Lundgren, which was a disappointment. Lundgren was good, but the movie was too Grade B cartoony and it took too many liberties. Still, some consider it a cult flick. The 2004 movie with Thomas Jane curiously transferred the character from New York City to sunny Florida, specifically the Tampa area. There were other oddities that didn’t sit well, but Jane was good as the protagonist and there was enough good in the flick to marginally enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThis 2008 rendition, “Punisher: War Zone,” was originally intended to be a sequel to the 2004 movie with Thomas Jane, but delays in the production caused him to pull out. Lexi Alexander ultimately got the gig as director and she pitched the idea of doing the film “as a throwback to '80s era action films” with 6’4” Ray Stevenson taking over as The Punisher.\r\n\r\nJigsaw (Dominic West) makes for a memorable villain with Loony Bin Jim an entertaining wacko sidekick (Doug Hutchison). Wayne Knight plays Microchip and Julie Benz the wife of an undercover agent that Castle mistakenly kills on one of his missions. The towering Colin Salmon stands out as a police agent intent on tracking down The Punisher.\r\n\r\nIt was a good call to bring the story back to New York City and, honestly, this has to be one of the best-looking big city movies I’ve ever seen, no kidding. The cinematography/locations/lighting are exceptional. While the movie has the urban grittiness of Nolan’s Batman trilogy, it balances it out with amusing cartoonish-ness. There is some quality drama, like Castle’s anguish over killing a “good guy” and his dealings with the dead agent’s widow & daughter, but it’s not overlong and dull like in “Batman Begins” (2005) and “The Dark Knight” (2008). Unfortunately, the last act, while serviceable, could’ve been better.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, “Punisher: War Zone” edges out the 2004 movie as the best film version of the character. It’s more faithful to the comics and overall more entertaining even though it totally bombed at the box office.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes and was shot in Montreal, Quebec.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

The gore, extreme violence, and borderline sadism is very much a part of the comic. Ray Stevenson is spot on as Frank Castle. Dominic West is not so good as Jigsaw but at least his gang is more competent than Travolta's.\r\n\r\nGiven that this came out in the same year as two other big comic book movies, there is one big thing that Punisher: War Zone contributes: proof that a female director can make an unforgivingly cruel but kick ass action flick, so I don't understand how more of them aren't being given the opportunity to do so."

The signal beams through TVs and radios, causing fear and paranoia.  Almost no-one is truly sure of anyone else or their motives.  Fear,  leading to hate, anger and violence.  The true horror of this film is that it is an accurate take on our world, only amplified to make its point.  \r\n\r\nHowever, The Signal is not merely a bleak film with no answers to the horrors expressed.  It provides hope and shows that love, support and trust are a remedy to the induced madness; a shared psychosis based on brainwashing.  It makes the case well for community over individualism, solidarity, substance over style, questioning, understanding, and hope instead of hate.  It does this through characters and situations that, although amplified, are poignant and credible reflections of our own societies.\r\n\r\nIf you like thoughtful horror films which make important points rather than the sheer pointless butchery of films like Saw, I highly recommend pulling the aerial out of the back of the TV and watching The Signal."

        "content": "The first thing that went through my head the second Sunshine Cleaning ended, was 'I could have gone on watching for at least another hour'. Not just because it ended a little abruptly, but mostly because I so thoroughly enjoyed this film, that I was seriously disappointed when it was over. It's like that book that's so compelling that you just want to inhale every word, but dread to actually finish.\r\n\r\nSunshine Cleaning is about two sisters, who, driven by dire financial straits, decide to start \"a biohazard removal/crime scene clean-up service\", cleaning up the houses of people who died gruesome deaths. The premise is fairly simple, but executed in a very lovely, heart-warming way, half tragedy – half comedy. Because of course, this film is not only about cleaning up other people's mess, but also about cleaning up some of their own baggage along the way, especially when the sisters are confronted with the memory of a death akin to what is now their daily business. Somewhere in between all this they have to deal with their eccentric father, the elder sister's peculiar son, love, loss, failure and a glimmer of hope. Reading this back now I realise this actually sounds really cheesy and sentimental, but I would have hated it if it was. Trust me.\r\n\r\nAmy Adams plays Rose, the eldest of the two, and Emily Blunt plays Norah, the rebellious younger sister. Rarely have I seen such great chemistry and energy between a leading pair. These two women make it seem like they've been working together for years, and physically they're a perfect match too, they actually look they could be sisters. Rose is obviously the mature, sensible one, whereas Norah just kind of takes things as they come, not worrying and not taking responsibility for her life. Though they seem to be bound not so much by kinship, but rather by a mutual fate and childhood hardship that has left its mark on both of them, although they deal with it very differently. Rose tries desperately to build a better life for herself and her son, but rarely finds any luck on her path. Norah just wings it and refuses to grow up.\r\n\r\nBoth Amy Adams and Emily Blunt prove to have great star quality and talent, and I think I can now officially call myself a fan of both. They are raw and real, one is sweet and the other is sour, without overacting anything. Alan Arkin is great as their dad. Eccentric, bitter yet loving, idealistic and seemingly in a mild state of denial. He plays pretty much the same character as in that other (great!) film of Sunshine Cleaning's producers, Little Miss Sunshine, where he also played the grumpy granddad. This type of role seems to be custom-made for him. Another great part is played by professional chameleon Clifton Collins, Jr. He plays Winston, the owner of a cleaning supplies shop, and he turns out to be that small shimmer of good luck that Rose so desperately needs. Actually, everyone in this film is so perfectly cast that it almost seems like this is a real family, in a real situation. It just doesn't feel contrived in any way, despite the lack of originality and obvious pitfalls where the story could have easily crashed and burned into a wasteland of melodrama and false sentiment. But like I mentioned earlier, this doesn't happen at any point. Usually when a film is on the borderline of becoming a total cliché, and yet works out successfully, it is because of one or maybe two factors. However, with Sunshine Cleaning, it's all of them. Cast, screenplay, dialogue, direction, camera work, production, just everything is wonderful. I'm actually running out of superlatives to describe this film.\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to give this film 10 stars, however there is just one small thing that kind of failed in my opinion and that's the ending. Nothing wrong with it story-wise, it just ended so abruptly that it feels like they literally ran out of tape. It actually kind of threw me off. But... oh, what the heck, this film deserves 10 stars, easily.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Sunshine Cleaning is just a beautifully crafted story about falling (hard) and getting back up on your feet again. It has a real indie-feel to it, it's basically just a pretty little art house gem. Funny thing – while I'm writing this, 4 Non Blondes' \"What's Up\" is playing in the background, and it feels strangely appropriate to the feeling of this film. So if you want to know what to expect of Sunshine Cleaning, listen to that song, it really captures the essence of the story. \r\n\r\nI can't think of much more to say to sell this film, all I can do is strongly recommend Sunshine Cleaning to pretty much anyone and everyone. It's wonderful.\r\n_(May 2012)_"

It stars Michael Keaton, Teri Garr and Martin Mull. Music is by Lee Holdridge and cinematography by Victor J. Kemper. Plot sees Keaton as Jack Butler, who after being laid off from work, is forced to become a house husband after his wife Caroline (Garr) lands a good job with Schooner Tuna - something he's really not cut out to do.\r\n\r\nAh, well, look, it's obviously very eighties, and thankfully society has moved on in leaps and bounds since this film was released. But good honest comedy is just that, honest, and for those looking for a good chuckle whilst admiring the talent of a pre-Batman Keaton, Mr. Mom is a bad mood lifter. Condensed into the 90 minute running time are enough gags and fun sequences to fill out a 12 episode sit-com, with a pre-teen-angst trail blazing John Hughes scripting it full of quotable lines. Lines which Keaton delivers with the comic timing not befitting someone just starting out in film.\r\n\r\nThe fun is mined from Jack being hopeless at basic household chores whilst badly tending the three young children at the same time. Enter scenes involving shopping, dropping the kids off at school, laundry, cooking and ironing. As his masculinity starts to wane, Jack starts too slob out and gets his kicks by watching day-time soap operas and playing cards with the neighbourhood women. This coincides with his wife Caroline (Garr adorable) advancing well at work, but paying a price for it by being away from the family home far too much. There's also the looming presence of Caroline's smarmy boss (Martin Mull delightfully sleazy) and the good time girl (Ann Jillian sexing it up) who has her eye on Jack for fun and frolics. Both of these are stereotypes, but they existed then as much as they exist now, with that, it's easy to cut Mr. Mom some slack.\r\n\r\nSupporting slots fall to Christopher Lloyd (who would re-team with Keaton for the very funny \"The Dream Team\" in 1989), Jeffrey Tambor (\"City Slickers\"), Graham Jarvis (TV \"Starsky & Hutch/Cagney & Lacey\") and Miriam Flynn (\"National Lampoon's Vacation\"). The child actors put in pleasing turns, where they score funny points both visually and orally, and director Dragoti (\"The Man With One Red Shoe\") directs in an unfussy natural way. Ultimately it's Keaton and Hughes' script that lifts it to better comedy heights, the latter of which also plays on some basic fears that arise in the real world. Yeah, it's not just about Jack's bumbling around the home, that John Hughes was a sharp fella you know. 7/10"

There’s even dashes of obsession, religio slights and a meditation on grief that earths the electricity buzzing about the hormonal place.\r\n\r\nThankfully, Lichtenstein keeps away from I Spit On Your Grave territory, finding a nice balance for Dawn, she is a character bombarded with a myriad of emotional conflicts, but hysteria does not dominate her make-up, and she’s never cartoonish either. View it more as a genre splicer than outright horror and better rewards await the interested observer. 6/10"

These thieves are so inept they leave their van parked next to the house, in full view of a couple of policemen who are even more inept; “This truck was used to rob a liquor store last night,” they inform the homeowners, whereupon they just drive off, leaving the getaway vehicle right where it is (but then cops are always incompetent in a Wes Craven film; cf. The Last House on the Left).\r\n\r\nThe inside of the house, which appears to have been designed by serial killer H.H. Holmes, is full of booby traps, including a door whose knob has been rigged to deliver electric shocks – in one hilarious scene, young Fool (Brandon Quintin Adams) grabs the doorknob with one hand while holding Leroy's (Ving Rhames) hand with the other; Leroy’s other hand is currently between a Rottweiler’s fangs, and the electrical charge travels through the two intruders and knocks out the dog.\r\n\r\nThe People Under the Stairs is like a Scooby Doo episode with a lot more blood in it; it’s indeed so ludicrous that the stolen coins are meant to pay for “mom's operation.” Having said that, there’s no question it was Craven’s intention all along to make a comedy. Moreover, it's impossible not to have a soft spot for a movie that includes a kid punching a Rottweiler in the face, an homage to The Shining, and the aforementioned dog going on an unexpected ride down a homemade slide, all in the space of just over three minutes."

That's about all I did rate from this though, with Oz itself not looking as magical as it should while the non-human characters are boring to me.\r\n\r\nTalking of the onscreen lot, Jean Marsh as Princess Mombi is the only performance I felt entertained by - she's very good. Away from her, there's not much to note. Fairuza Balk is solid in the role of Dorothy, nothing really to say about her other than she does an OK job; considering her age. The Wheelers are kinda interesting, they do look cool.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame they don't make use of Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion and Tin Man - the latter I'm actually glad they didn't, given how awful his design was. I get why they don't feature more, given the source material, but it feels a needless change-up especially with Billina, Tik-Tok and Jack Pumpkinhead being so lame.\r\n\r\nI read that this is apparently true to the original book series, which is respectable.

Traumatised by her first visit to \"Oz\" her desperate \"Auntie Em\" (Piper Laurie) resorts to electrical therapy to try and help her young niece. Luckily, a thunderstorm comes to her rescue and escaping from the asylum where she was to be treated, she finds herself back in a now desolate land of \"Oz\". The yellow brick road has been torn up and the emerald city is but a ruin. It turns out that the subterranean \"Nome King\" has determined to reclaim all the precious stones stolen (as he sees it) from his realm, and so together with the Princess \"Mombi\" has reduced the once mighty city to rubble. It falls to young \"Dorothy\" and her new friends \"Jack Pumpkinhead\" and the rotund tin soldier \"Tik-Tok\" to find the mysterious powder of life and try to outsmart the pair and restore the kingdom. This story has much more menace to it. The treatment scenario at the start (aided well by Nicol Williamson and Jean Marsh) works effectively, and the multi headed Princess gives Sophie Ward and Fiona Victory an opportunity to spread a little mayhem too. My biggest gripe with this is that Miss Balk looks much younger that Judy Garland, and she isn't a terribly engaging actress either. The animation is a bit on the basic side, too, but it does move along well with plenty of flying sofas and a message that green is always good!"

It was apparently considered to be a transitional role for the young lead actor, Haley Joel Osmont, from The Sixth Sense and Pay It Forward, to more mature roles. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, when it showed comic strips drawn by the boy as an adult, it reminded my strongly of Walt Kelly’s Pogo, and the character’s name is also Walt.

However, I am fully aware that this type of summit is usually a rallying point for demonstrators in favor of a thousand ideals: rebels without a cause, anarchists, socialists, communists, environmentalists, conspiracy theorists...\r\n\r\nI don't really know what happened, but there is no doubt that these protests were violent and, to a certain extent, they managed to achieve their objectives, severely disrupting the summit and the life of the city, and becoming a juicier and more relevant matter than the summit itself. In the following summits, there was more care. I could make a series of considerations around the real usefulness of the WTO, or even if there aren't other ways to encourage a greater trade flow and greater ease in commercial exchanges between countries, making it possible to end this, apparently questionable, organization. But one thing I learned in my life: the owners of money usually win these wars, even if they lose some battles along the way.\r\n\r\nThe film is very competently directed by Stuart Townsend. The director does not hide that his heart and admiration are with the protesters in the streets, and the film is not neutral about that. Thus, we witness the glorification of peaceful protests, the demonization of authorities (even though the police are portrayed as men who only do their job) and even the exposure of many of those who, under the cover of protests, broke and burned things just because it seemed a good idea. Personally, I would have preferred a more neutral approach, because if the idea was to demonize the economy and the WTO, it should have been better contextualized.\r\n\r\nThe cast has some well-known names, and Martin Henderson turns out to be one of the actors who deserve our applause. He's done a good job, he's in excellent shape, and he's used the material he's been given very well to give personality and depth to his character. I also really liked the performance of Charlize Theron, in the role of her wife. Ray Liotta is very good in the role of a mayor who is overtaken by events. The rest of the cast, however, I felt didn't stand out, and didn't do much more than they really had to.\r\n\r\nThe film has an extraordinary cinematic beauty, as it manages to recreate very well what was experienced on the streets during those days in December 1999. The way in which everything was recreated is pleasantly aesthetic without losing any kind of credibility or realism. The sets (streets) and costumes also help a lot and the cinematography makes good use of gas fumes and light and shadow effects, in addition to a series of moving camera shots, which transport us to the middle of the action."

Story focuses on a group of London youngsters who have been given the day off school when one of their classmates commits suicide after being bullied. The various groups of friends spin off to do their own thing, which invariably involves drugs, violence, casual sex, teenage pregnancy angst, revenge and lots of cussing in street speak. All this is crammed into a 24 hour period, suggesting that the yoof of today never live a dull moment when not at school.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWriter Noel Clarke (who also stars) and director Menhaj Huda clearly want to keep things raw and authentic, but it eventually comes off as wholly unbelievable. In fact it at times feels like it’s a bunch of mates making a film and living out some fantasies where they get to be wicked for a day. There’s some messages in the mix trying to break out of the hysteria, to be a wake-up call to parents and elders as to what is happening under our noses, but ultimately sensationalism wins the day.\r\n\r\nIt’s a film strung together by a number of instances, characterisation and reasoning is given short shrift, the makers over egging the pudding in their unrelenting mission to shock. Some scenes are undeniably attention grabbing, while the soundtrack pulses away with verve and Brian Tufano’s cinematography is right on the money, but come the preachy finale you may feel you really haven’t learned anything new about the unruly and unfeeling kids of today. 6/10"

Scott as the infamous Ebenezer Scrooge, Clive Donner’s movie pays great respects to the source material and garners a multi stranded piece of brilliance out of Scott. The characters of course remain the same, but headed by Scrooge having a complex and painful background and a persona of confused emotions, there’s meaty substance holding the movie up high. Donner and writer Roger Hirson retain the black heart of the source story, with the horror elements suitably effective to bother the children, while the Victorian atmosphere always feels – crucially – authentic.\r\n\r\nIf you haven’t seen this version of the often filmed tale, put it on your list for next yuletide. 9/10"

Scott) gains insights on the past, present and future.

Scott makes for a fitting Ebenezer Scrooge and everything is in glorious color with haunting cinematography. Anyone who knows the tale knows there are heartwarming aspects, but also very spooky bits, like Jacob Marley’s ghost and the dark specter Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come.   \r\n\r\nWhile I prefer winsome Ann Rutherford as the Spirit of Christmas Past in the 1931 version, Angela Pleasence is fine in the role (she’s Donald’s daughter and looks it). Also notable on the female front is Susannah York as Mrs. Cratchit, who still looks great at 44 during shooting, as well as the lovely Caroline Langrishe in the role of Janet, the wife of Scrooge’s nephew.  \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

        "content": "Dead Space Downfall reduces its space horror aesthetic to a chunk of unpolished planetary rock. Back when Electronic Arts released the original ‘Dead Space’, I happened to download and install the demo. A thirty minute segment that highlighted the darkened horror and survivalist gameplay mechanics. That, well, was enough for me. Far too frightening and involving for me. So when I heard an animated prequel was released, my intrigue once again spiked and perhaps would illicit a fresh wave of adoration for the video game franchise. Sadly, it did the opposite, deterring me away from the games forever. A planetary flight crew discover an extraterrestrial monolithic marker that rapidly turn members into homicidal nightmarish creatures, meaning the remaining individuals must fight to survive.\r\n\r\nThus begins the enduring battle against the animalistic Necromorphs. Yet beneath the blood covering the crevices of the Ishimura and the mundane brutality of limbs being severed, is an undercooked plot circling around faith. Followers of the Church of Unitology demanding to see the newly acquired holy relic, devotees oblivious to the chaotic harm that it has caused. Religious persecution, if you will.\r\n\r\nHowever the writers chose to subdue this interesting strand and instead incorporated a thirty minute montage of crew members being savaged by Necromorphs through some of the most bland, stilted and downright dreadful animation available. Over-textured blurry 3D CGI monstrosities that forced me to question if I had my spectacles on or not, never complementing the basic 2D character designs. The original ‘Scooby Doo’ series looked better than this, a cartoon created decades ago! The characters themselves had no personality injected into them and instead emanated hard talking shells. “Fight...or die!”. “I’m not a hero, just a man!”. The voice acting was nearly as tedious as a Bible reading powered by the emotionless tones of Tommy Wiseau. The blood, whilst insurmountable in terms of quantity, was too excessive and tame to be effective.\r\n\r\nIf it wasn’t for the overburden of paranoia, mass hysteria and delusional grandeur, which can be contributing factors for deep space travel, this animated prequel would have nothing going for it. It’s just an ‘Alien’ ripoff, and about as dead as the animators’ sense for artistic quality. Just play the game instead."

        "content": "'Friday the 13th' turned out to be one of the biggest disappointments when it comes to horror classics remakes. After watching the trailers, I got the wrong idea that this film was going to be more serious. The previews gave me the false impression that this remake was going to go deeper into Jason's background story or maybe even offer extremely gory murders, when in reality, it is exactly the opposite. I'm not one of those horror lovers who want to know everything related to the villains, their origins and such, but in this case, it would have been acceptable to throw in some flashbacks regarding Jason Voorhees' past. Unfortunately, this remake wastes all the opportunities to make this interesting and instead, it offers an exaggerated and ineffective amount of comedy situations that are badly placed and ruin the possibility of creating a genuine horror feeling. Comedy situations in slasher films are no surprise, but in this remake, the attempted comedy is badly placed and seems like it was forced by the producers to make the film more marketable. I will give an example: after a really tense and dramatic persecution, the film cuts to a scene involving a horny stereotyped hillbilly lusting over a mannequin, while Jason silently walking up to him from behind, with the obvious intention of slashing him. How can they mix cheap humor and tension in one scene? The results obviously cannot be good. It was a murder scene, but instead of causing uneasiness, tension or shock, everyone at the movie theater was laughing at the guy talking about how he lost his virginity to a mannequin. The worst part is that the so-called humor is extremely 15-years-ago and even back then, it wouldn't have been funny.\r\n\r\nThe gore is very unsatisfying also. Nowadays, slasher films usually offer creative and really brutal murders and even if the plot is not so good, you can always at least settle for that. When I found out that Marcus Nispel was directing this, I thought it was good news, because he directed \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" remake, which is a fine example of a movie that may not be as good as the original, but at least it offers something more serious, gory and overall fulfilling. Naturally, since Marcus Nispel also directed 'Friday the 13th' remake, I expected something in the same vein as 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' remake. Sadly, that was a very inaccurate assumption. In this film, the gore is completely unsatisfactory and in some cases, the murders are even funny. The entire movie theater burst into a maniacal laughter during some of the murders and I must say that in those cases, I had to agree with them.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that bothered me about this film, is the fact that they could have showed a little bit more about the character of Mrs. Voorhees. Unfortunately, she only appears during the first seconds of the film and they cut her scenes with the opening credits, which is a disgrace. The confrontation between Mrs. Voorhees and the counselor girl is perhaps one of the finest points of the entire 'Friday the 13th' series, and it should have been remade in an equally tense way. Cutting the scene with the opening credits is, in my opinion, a self-sabotage. I think it's safe to say that many fans of the original film were eager to learn some more about Jason's beloved mother and see her more time on the screen. But no... apparently, they didn't even take advantage of that opportunity to make this movie more interesting. True, we see a little bit about Jason's environment, since the characters get to take a tour inside his house and it was a good idea to show his bedroom and evidence the fact that once upon a time, the killing machine was an innocent boy with a normal life. However, that doesn't make up for the lack of space that Mrs. Voorhees had on the story.\r\n\r\n'Friday the 13th' turned out to be a teen comedy with lousy humor and some badly placed murders from the beginning until the end. Watch it if you're curious, but unless you're a silly teenager who thinks everything is funny, don't expect anything even remotely good, because you'll be devastated."

        "content": "***Scarier and with a more dangerous Jason, but not as fun***\r\n\r\nI became a fan of the \"Friday the 13th\" series after seeing \"Part V: A New Beginning\" (1985) on TV in the late 90s and have subsequently digested all of the films in the series. This '09 reboot takes elements of the first four films, drops all campy elements seen in Part III (and V, VI, IX & X) and provides better scares with a more dangerous Jason, who runs, shoots arrows, uses traps and schemes. In the original series Jason was comparable to an unstoppable zombie-like force, particularly as the series progressed where Jason became more & more infernal and monstrous. Here he's more human, which makes sense since it's early in the timeline and Jason hasn't yet morphed into the hellish zombie he became in later segments.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of the series for is not the gore or kills but rather the plot of a group of youths gathering in the wilderness; the inclusion of a psycho killer on the loose adds a necessary element of threat & suspense, and Jason's a quality nemesis/monster. Simply put, \"Friday the 13th\" is an entertaining series with creepy elements, but I never found the flicks all that scary, not even the first two films, which are the most serious in tone, along with IV, VII, VIII and XI. Of course there are jump-scares galore, but that's not what I'm talking about. With the third installment, campiness was added, which made several of the installments even less scary. The good thing about this '09 reboot is that it throws out the campy aspects and opts for a more serious approach. In addition, it has a couple of sequences that produce actual frights, something I never experienced with the rest of the series, as well as scenes with genuine suspense, like when Jason chases the three protagonists through the tunnels, etc.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the three protagonists, the cast is filled with youthful no-names, but the three main protagonists, a brother & sister and a brunette who takes a liking to the brother, are good and likable. It's always nice to have some people you can root for. Really, there are only two characters who are unlikable, a creepy redneck hick (and his \"hot\" mannequin, lol) and the arrogant alpha-male whose father owns the vacation house.\r\n\r\nI found one aspect of the film highly unusual and unique. I'm referring to the 24-minute prologue before the opening credits. This has to be one of the longest prologues in film history. I have to give credit to the filmmakers for being creative and trying something different.\r\n\r\nThis reboot also just plain LOOKS better than all those older films; I'm referring mostly to the creepy woods at night. This is to be expected, of course, with the advancements in filming technology since 1980, not to mention the bigger budget.\r\n\r\nThe series is known for its excellent assortment of women in every entry, but this one's not quite as good as most of the films in the franchise. There's the excellent Amanda (America Olivo) in the first act and also Whitney (Amanda Righetti) and Jenna (Danielle Panabaker) as the two female protagonists. They're solid, but not in the same league as Pam in Part V, Agent Marcus in Part IX and Heather in Part XI (FvJ). I suppose it's all a matter of taste though. \r\n\r\nThe film was shot in the heart of Texas, mainly in regions relatively near Austin.\r\n\r\nFINAL WORD: My biggest criteria for judging the worth of a film is whether or not it pulls me in and makes me forget about the passing of time. This '09 reboot succeeds in this respect. Although nothing can replace the initial 1980 film and its immediate sequel, this reboot should be given credit for generating a few genuine scares, which I rarely if ever experienced with the rest of the series; not to mention providing a worthy trio of protagonists, as well as scenes with genuine momentum. \r\n\r\nOther than these factors, the reboot is just more of the same, but it's at least as good as the better sequels, although it's not as fun as several of them because it shoots for serious horror. This is good, but the first half is more effective than the second. And it fails to approach the greatness of the '09 remake of \"The Last House on the Left,\" a veritable masterpiece that transcends the usual one-dimensional nature of most slasher flicks, not that I would expect (or necessarily want) that for \"Friday the 13th.\" \r\n\r\nI have the \"Killer Cut\" that runs 105 minutes, while the theatrical version runs 97 minutes. Needless to say, this is a heavy R-rated picture.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

        "content": "**The following is a long-form review that I originally wrote in 2009.**\r\n\r\n_Friday the 13th_, originally released in 1980 began one of the most successful film franchises of all time. Now, 31 years later, the newest incarnation of _Friday the 13th_ has just been released on Special Edition DVD. It seems unlikely that the director of the first film Sean S. Cunningham (who is also the producer of the 2009 version) could ever have seen just where the monster he had helped to create would go. So now, with the series being given one of those oh-so-popular of late \"reboots\", it's important to take a look at what Jason Voorhees has been up to, what has changed, and just as importantly, what hasn't.\r\n\r\nThe film loosely follows the progression of the first four _Friday the 13th_ films, the opening credit sequence has mother dearest Pamela Voorhees on June 13, 1980 confronting one of the Camp Crystal Lake counsellors , she is promptly decapitated with a machete, as per the original story. This is a powerful intro to the rest of the movie, as a reboot, you have to show Mrs. Voorhees at some point in time, but it can't take up too many of those valuable 90 minutes. At this point the film begins to deviate from the original, we get some of Harry Manfredini's musical score (Ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma) but this time round Jason is very much alive, sees his mother beheaded and picks up his iconic machete and some very bad habits from here on in. After the credits there is a new bunch of kids, looking to score some pot, have a little pre-marital sex, get wasted, go places they're not allowed, and just generally set themselves up to die. But something is missing... that would be... Oh yes, the cast! Only a single member of the \"media-hyped\" actors portrays a character in this group, so we already know that these guys are going nowhere. Only after their demise are we given the \"_FRIDAY THE 13TH_\" movie title, and the film begins. Unfortunately, by the time this happens, we have already been through a good set of characters, and it feels like watching a sequel after you're 23 minutes in.\r\n\r\nThe new group of rowdy teenagers have much the same plans in store as the last, but they are much less believable characters when compared to the ones we had just minutes ago. They are somewhat saved by the performances of Travis Van Winkle (from _Accepted_) as Trent, the \"rich asshole\" of the movie, and Aaron Yoo as Chewie, the lovable little stoner. Jared Padalecki's character Clay (a reboot of Rob from _Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter_) is wholly out of place, maybe it's his _Supernatural_ fame or maybe it's his deliberate intention to not have a good time. Either way the protagonist of the entire film really doesn't seem like he belongs in the movie at all. Sort of a down point when you think about it.\r\n\r\nWhile the film didn't seem to have plot holes per se, it very much seems as though they tried to fit the creation of the film in before it was due to be released on Friday, February 13th. Now don't get me wrong, I love novelty and a good theatrical gimmick as much as anyone can, but know what I care about even more? The end product (especially when it comes to _Friday the 13th_)! The time could have been much better spent on filling in all the little bits where the movie just seemed to be missing something. You're not quite sure what it is, but that's their job to figure out.\r\n\r\nThe hype over the film's sexual content seems to have been grossly over-exaggerated. Supposedly Michael Bay walked out of the first screening due to the sex scenes. After having watched the film, I find this very difficult to believe. Although the sex does seem to have been thrown in for the Hell of it (isn't it always), there really isn't all that much. But, after all of the problems the film goes through, they get the most important thing right, Jason. With culturally recognised hockey mask and machete in tow, Mr. Voorhees does his thing, and he does it well. Whilst this particular incarnation of Jason is wholly more believable than any of the others, Derek Mears makes it work, he's not a supernatural boogieman-esque killing machine, he's a hunter, he's a natural, he's almost the anti-hero. Upon first hearing that Kane Hodder was yet again not to be playing the role of Jason Voorhees, I think a little part of me died inside. But I submit, Derek Mears has given the best representation of Jason I think we've ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe 2009 reboot of _Friday the 13th_ is the type of movie that you can watch, and when it's finished, want to go right back to the beginning and watch it all over again, you're just not sure why...\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_"

It does manipulate the facts a little; though the use of bouncing bombs - innovatively designed from scratch - well, with a little help from Napoleon - by Barnes Wallis (Michael Redgrave) to destroy three German dams on the Ruhr by a squadron led by Wing Commander Guy Gibson (Richard Todd) is fact. The film gradually demonstrates the frustrations as these devices are tested, of the dedication of those charged with delivering them and, of course, of the peril faced by the crews - many of whom were destined never to return. I saw this recently on television and the announcer apologised in advance for the \"racist language\" which i assumed referred to Gibson's dog. Strange it didn't see fit to apologise for the portrayal of indiscriminate death inflicted by both sides on the other. An odd, modern day irony only made possible by the exploits of the sorts of people and achievements this film sets out to commemorate."

But this soon becomes the very least of their problems, because they are car-jacked by escaped convict Dennis Farell (Shea Whigham) and his drug addict girlfriend Lacey Belisle (Rachel Kerbs).

It’s a siege situation with the enemy some sort of porcupine – vegetable – human hybrid, and it’s relentless and clever. Director Toby Wilkins doesn’t once let the picture sag or suffer from filler, all scenes and character interactions are integral to the plotting. Mercifully free of characters doing the dumb things that are so inherent in this splinter (hrr hrr hrr) of horror, Wilkins’ film is consistently effective in what it wants to achieve. \r\n\r\nThe effects are kept to a minimum and the only real complaint is that for every attack by the creature we are subjected to shakycam. If this is to hide the effects work we don’t know? And it’s always great to have a horror assailant be used sparingly on a visual level, but the shakycam becomes annoying and feels like a bit of a cheat in the final quarter. The small cast offer up some sterling performances, with Whigham standing out as the hateful villain, while Nelson Cragg’s photography strips the colours down to primal indie level and the film is better for it.\r\n\r\nA pleasant surprise and recommended to horror fans after a quick and bloody siege horror that never disappoints. 7.5/10"

They rioted, beating the local priest and killing a merchant and government official. The two men considered ringleaders, Aslak Haetta and Mons Somby, were tried and executed. This incidence is little-known in most of Europe, but in the history of the Sami people it is one of the few tales of resistence to pressure from their southern neighbors and has gained a sort of epic status. Nils Gaups' 2008 film <i>The Kautokeino Rebellion</i> depicts this event. The main character of the film is Ellen Aslaksdatter Skum, who with her husband Mathis Haetta, was sentenced to long imprisonment. Ellen is played by Anni-Kristiina Juuso, a Sami actress best known for her role in Aleksandr Rogozhkin's 2001 film <i>The Cuckoo</i>. The film is multilingual, with the Sami speaking their own language, Swedish used as a lingua franca, and Norwegian heard from a few outsiders. Mid-19th century Norway is depicted in absorbing detail, and watching the film I felt to some degree that I was sharing the challenges of the characters in the frozen north.\r\n\r\nThe film takes a few liberties with history (the whipping of the priest isn't portrayed, and the rioters are stopped by what seem to be Norwegians instead of their own other Sami neighbors. Still, it's generally factual and really inspires the viewer to go out and learn more about the event. What I really admire about the film is that it doesn't try to portray the murderers as bold defenders of national consciousness: their uprising was something of an act of blind rage and they were betraying their own Christian ideals. Other depictions of the riots, such as Launis' godawful opera \"Aslak Hetta\", give in to hyperbolic National Romantic feelings, but Gaups' film keeps it on the level."

I admittedly do have a difficult time separating film and real life, to me films are just fictional things but I get they can/do have real world implications.\r\n\r\nStrictly as a film, it is entertaining. Clint Eastwood is remarkably good at being a super racist and super grumpy old man, who literally hates every single person he encounters across the opening portion of the film. His character's lines in this are nuts and his delivery with them is incredible - the look of utter disgust on Walt Kowalski's face when someone pisses him off in a new way is just amusing to watch. If not for his on point delivery, it wouldn't have worked.\r\n\r\nEastwood is the only actor in this worth talking about on a grander level, though I could've done without his ropey singing at the end, but I did enjoy the showings of the earlier mentioned Vang, Ahney Her and John Carroll Lynch - not that the latter does much, I just like the guy as an actor... all stems from <em>'<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Walking Dead</a>'</em>, he's in literally one episode back in 2015 and yet I always remember his character.\r\n\r\nI'm not sold on the ending, Walt isn't exactly redeemed and it does reek of white saviour let's be real, but it didn't affect my enjoyment in film terms to be honest."

I've heard it said that, with this tale, Dickens invented Christmas. I am not able to go that far, but I recognize that the tale changed the way we face this season: instead of being just a religious festival, it became a family celebration, much more secular and almost returning to its pagan roots. This is just another movie based on the tale.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, I won't waste my time talking about the script, we know how it ends. And perhaps because of this condition, I felt that this film lacks an additional dose of irreverence and humor, which tends to be more evident whenever the Looney Tunes are called. Here, the humor is essentially based on the amount of aggression, slaps and deformations that poor Daffy Duck can withstand for forty-five minutes. This ends up tiring after a while. I also felt that Bugs Bunny is lefting in the film, he acts almost like a “jiminy cricket”, a voice of conscience, and not like a plot character.\r\n\r\nThe film is technically very good and features several well-known voices for those familiar with the Tunes. Joe Alasky and Bob Bergen are especially good, however they are masters of the task at hand and I doubt this film was too challenging for them. Visually, the film is very elegant. I don't know if it was made using digital animation, I believe so, but the truth is that it seems to respect the aesthetics and traditional appearance of the dolls we grew up with."

The only problem is that the latter is an expert fighter and survivalist.\r\n\r\nThis is a well done revenge Western with spectacular and varied remote Western locations (detailed below). If you thought Brosnan was a pretty boy as James Bond this movie will change your mind as he’s virtually unrecognizable as the skilled Rambo-like militarist. The tone is similar to contemporaneous Westerns like “The Missing” (2003) and “September Dawn” (2007), but with a revenge-chase plot. The final act throws in supernatural elements with characters like Mr. Charon (Wes Studi) and Louise C. Fair (Angelica Huston). You don’t have to think too hard to figure out who they really are. \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 55 minutes and was shot in Oregon (McKenzie River, Sahalie Falls and Koosah Falls), New Mexico (Lordsburg, Taos, Bramlett and Santa Fe), Arizona (Willcox Playa, Pirtleville, San Bernardino Valley and Chiricahua National Monument) and Death Valley National Park, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

        "content": "Go as you wish. That which is yours will always return to you. That which you take will always be taken from you.\r\n\r\nSeraphim Falls is directed by David Von Ancken who also co-writes with Abby Everett Jaques. It stars Liam Neeson, Pierce Brosnan, Michael Wincott, Xander Berkeley, Tom Noonan, Kevin J. O'Connor, John Robinson, Ed Lauter, Wes Studi and Anjelica Huston. Music is by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by John Toll.\r\n\r\nIt's post American Civil War, 1868, the Rocky Mountains, and Gideon (Brosnan) is being hunted by Colonel Morsman Carver (Neeson) and his hired killers. The reason why is not yet known, but it's the beginning of a relentless pursuit that's propelled by rage and hatred, a pursuit that will force both men to the day of reckoning.\r\n\r\nThe premise is as simple as it gets and on the surface the film holds no surprises until the divisive ending. However, before taking in the thematics of the story, it's refreshing to find a film of this genre type utilising the scenery to the max, whilst simultaneously playing out with sparse dialogue as two grizzled actors tell the story. An obvious forebear to \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\", Seraphim Falls is ultimately a meditation on revenge and remorse. Moments of violence flit in and out of proceedings, these moments cloaked magnificently by natural surroundings, where the expansive wilderness plays host to the intimate human drama unfolding. It's also a film that pulses with mythical atmosphere, where Carver's pursuit of Gideon plays out like that of the Grim Reaper and his charges sent to capture the soul of the fleeing man. The falls of the title clearly indicates man's decent into hell, because it's not for nothing that the finale is played out on a blistering plain, which as you cast your eyes upon it, it is indeed hellish.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that we the viewers are never sure who we should be rooting for - if either of them!? Gideon is out on his own, but he is an immensely skilled mountain man, one who is seemingly out skilling his pursuers. Is he the bad guy here? Or is it Neeson's Carver? One is ex Union, the other Confederate, this gives added spice to what then develops into a most intriguing journey. Where the film has irked some critics is with the ending, with some calling it pretentious and a very weak pay off. It's true enough to say that Ancken has slackened the grip slightly, as the tight gritty tone gives way to something more open and even airy. Yet I personally like it a lot, it helps to round out the supernatural feel that appears to loom as we have headed towards the day of reckoning. It lacks dramatic impact for sure, but thematically and for tonal bedfellow process, it pays off on what had gone before it.\r\n\r\nBrosnan (stepping in when Richard Gere bailed out) and Neeson revel in the roles, seemingly enjoying the complexities and war torn burdens that their characters carry. Their scenes together are as professional as one could wish, both men comfortably doing world weary characterisations. Wincott is on hand for gravel voiced villain duties, his portrayal of Hayes is cold and in keeping with the movie. The other notable names in the cast drop in and out of the narrative, each important, and in the case of Huston and Studi, suitably weird. But the real star of the show is John Toll (Braveheart/Legends of the Fall), whose photography is pristine and  always remaining atmospheric, he captures the natural beauty of Oregon and New Mexico with great keen eyed skill. Switiching seamlessly from the blue, grey and whites of the mountain pursuit to the browns and yellows of the salt flats, we witness a master cinematographer at work. \r\n\r\nLikely to infuriate as much as it enthrals, one just hopes that it's the latter that anyone reading this does indeed find to be the case. 8/10"

Pressure is on then!?\r\n\r\nBasically this is just real solid kidnap thriller film making, the kind that we were well served with back in the 1980s, and with that in mind this comes off like a throw back to that decade. Brosnan (how nice to see him doing a natural Irish brogue) grows ever more spiteful, while of course our handsome couple get more frantic.\r\n\r\nBut naturally there's a mystery going on here, we are left in no doubt about that there is something lurking beyond the edges of the frames. To which the inevitable twist, on which the whole pic's very being depends upon, will either make or break how you ultimately feel about the piece as a whole.\r\n\r\nI liked it. 7/10"

Now he (\"Damian\") and his pal \"Anthony\" (Lewis McGibbon) are honest sort of lads - though not take it to the police station sort of honest - and they decide that they can become the benefactors for some people and institutions who need a bit of help. Clearly, though - they can't distribute it all in time, so they gradually start to include their friends and family in the disposal of their largess and that's when the story starts to take on a more critical aspect. We see humanity in many of it's guises emanating when lucre is involved - and some of that behaviour isn't so charming. The writing is often quite pithily amusing - the young lad has an habit of talking to saints, to whom he attributes his windfall, and writer Frank Cottrell Boyce quite cleverly uses this innocence and generosity of spirit to create a template for a look at just how we react when money is the raison d'être - too little, too much, sharing, hoarding, stealing... This is a well delivered testament to the acting talents of the two youngsters and to a bit of amusing, though-provoking, writing that I would not say is especially memorable - but it is enjoyable."

Ginny is incredibly, pretty much, the villain of the production, for no real reason other than disliking the current period for logical reasons. Elsewhere on the cast, you have notable roles for Harry Dean Stanton (Gideon) and Elisabeth Harnois (Abbie). Stanton, himself, is alright.\r\n\r\nThe film actually builds up nicely, before the already mentioned capitulation with the story occurs. <em>'One Magic Christmas'</em> is extremely odd!"

The psychological thriller – specifically that of a spouse being tormented by their partner – has been mined for all its worth - and will continue to do so. Even the terminology of very real life instances such as Gaslighted/Gaslighting have been born out from the pic, so if it is thought of being dated or old hat, its influence is still quite considerable.\r\n\r\nIt’s still a terrific atmospheric thriller anyway, played out to a magnificent backdrop of Victorian London, of fogs and cobbled streets, and of course gas lights and eerie shadows. Pic is split into two halves, first half is the set-up of a whirlwind romance that leads to marriage, then the move to the marital home and support characters - nosy neighbour (Whitty), housekeeper (Everest), tart housemaid (Lansbury on debut) - are introduced to proceedings. Deft psychological touches are being played out, though wonderfully we never actually see the misdirection machinations actually being done.\r\n\r\nThen as the second half happens upon us it really hits the diabolical straps, the methodical manoeuvres of Gregory Anton really start to gnaw away at our senses. We witness Paula come apart, her mind fractured, so vulnerable and confused, you would have to have a heart of stone not to have your very core ache. It’s here where Bergman, in the first of her three Best Actress Oscar wins, excels without duff histrionics. Boyer also is superb, where guided by the astute Cukor he makes Gregory a dashing dastard, only given to subtle clues about his devious and wicked doings.\r\n\r\nCotton doesn’t try to do a British accent, which is fine as he holds his end up well as Brian Cameron, the man getting to grips with what’s actually going on in the Alton home. Brian is our hero in waiting, giving us something to hang onto as the pic reaches revelations point. With Ruttenberg (Oscar Nominated) drifting what would be known as noirish contrasts over the piece, and Kaper’s music unobtrusively subtle, Gaslight hits high marks for tech credit substance. All told it’s a truly great film, and one that’s well worth going back to if you become jaded with the more slick and polished production line genre pieces that follow in its wake. 9/10"

Weaver wasn't really as innocent or as guilty as they made him out to be, he was more the catalyst than anything else.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it's still a movie about a legend. My dad told me the story, my grandfather told me the story, it was party of my childhood and we Cubs fans. So, walking into this, when I was 8, I already new how it was going to end, all the names involved...\r\n\r\n...and reviewing it at almost 40, it hasn't changed at all, it's still the legend Chicago baseball fans grew up with, projected on the big screen, to sit back and take in as if you were watching the cautionary tail yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd the thing is, it holds up to it. It holds up to the story of Shoeless Joe that inspired but the book (named after him) and the movie that would become Field of Dreams. It lives up to the stories that Grandpa and Dad told me from different points of view about where the guilt rested. It lives up to the stories of the darkest times during the greatest era in baseball history.\r\n\r\nI'm writing this in 2018, the movie is set almost exactly a century ago and people are still telling stories of Joe Jackson, Ty Cobb (unfortunately slurring his name still), Babe Ruth, Buck Weaver, Honus Wagner,Cy Young, Lou Gehrig, and so many others. They became legends that Nolan Ryan could only dream of...and it was because the era was so important in the history of our national past time.\r\n\r\nAnd Eight Men Out stands up to that legend and that mythological era where the gods played baseball.\r\n\r\nIt's really a must watch for any fan of the sport, and a must watch for any fan of movies in general simply because it lives up to all of that."

It stars Richard Burton, Claire Bloom, Oskar Werner, Peter van Eyck, Sam Wanamaker, Rupert Davies and Cyril Cusack. Music is by Sol Kaplan and cinematography by Oswald Morris.\r\n\r\nDisillusioned spy Alex Leamas (Burton) returns from Berlin and is required to \"come in from the cold\" and work in a stable everyday job environment. But this is just a small piece of a much bigger jigsaw… From start to finish this is a deliberate downer of a movie, the complete flipside to the spy adventures served up in other high energy filmic quarters. Filmed in coarse monochrome to set the mood, picture is often depressing, overtly talky and complex in its characterisations and narrative bent. However, those things are not hindrances, for this is undeniably adult stuff, oozing with intelligence and intricacies for the mature film fan, a clinically spun web of pawns, manipulations and distrustful men. The Cold War backdrop is marked as deathly cold, where the grey weather is only matched by the colourless complexion of Burton's depressed spy. As the twists rack up and the tension noose is tightened, Ritt and his cast of excellent performers are only interested in keeping it real, right up to, and including, the devastating finale.\r\n\r\nNot one to turn to when in need of a pick-me-up, or in fact a film you want to watch perennially, but certainly it's a piece of work that serves to remind us that intense well written and performed cinema is always available to view when the mood fits. 8/10"

From there it gets even weirder. I felt this took away from his character rather than make him more intriguing. Regardless, Nolte does a respectable job in the role and, again, I did enjoy his many gems of wisdom throughout. Some say his philosophies reflects a Buddhist mindset, but I saw Biblical Christianity. For instance:\r\n\r\n* The stress on service and humility, i.e. servanthood.\r\n\r\n* \"Putting out the trash,\" i.e. putting off the 'old man' (the flesh) and putting on the 'new' (the spirit).\r\n\r\n* Random thoughts are not you but they can become you if you embrace them and allow them to control/lead you.\r\n\r\n* Joy despite the mundane.\r\n\r\n* Discerning the real spirit of others (in the compassionate sense, although sometimes for protection).\r\n\r\n* Give to those who ask of you.\r\n\r\n* Turning the cheek as one's initial response to antagonism (but, keep in mind, you only have two cheeks, facially speaking).\r\n\r\nAnd much more. These are axioms, universal truths that are true regardless of one's lineage, culture or present belief system. It's this aspect and the character of Socrates that make the film worthwhile.\r\n\r\nOther than that, though, the plot mechanics are just too obvious. The viewer's aware of the contrivances just as much as the peripheral actors, who struggle with the material because of it. But the main actors do a splendid job despite these negatives. Speaking of the actors, beauties Amy Smart and Agnes Bruckner are noticeably underused. (I watched the 'deleted scenes' and their screen-time was cut; the fools).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours and was shot in the areas of University of California, Berkeley, and USC, Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

In this movie, lowly criminals meets councillors, junkies, dead musicians, dirty accountants, nasty crime bosses and filthy rich russians. Sounds like another movie by Guy Ritchie, more or less, and it does indeed follow the same rhythm (and theme) as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with the narrator, Archy, who breaks down the plot for us in tiny, easy-to-digest bits, and thats definitely my least favorite bit in the movie, but sadly, needed. This plot is a twisted labyrinth, that constantly shifts from one person to the next. There are no real heroes here, just fish eaten by sharks, hunted by humans, killed by... you get the point.\r\n\r\nRocknRolla has a huge cast, and some big names too. In smaller roles, you'll see names such as Tom Hardy (Handsome Bob), Jeremy Piven (Roman), Thandie Newton (Stella) and Idris Elba (Mumbles), and in the bigger, you find names like Gerard Butler (One Two), Mark Strong (Archy) and Tom Wilkinson (Lenny Cole). Most of them delivers quirky and fun characters, and some of them even gives us a bit to think about, like Tom Hardy's role, Handsome Bob, who is coming to terms with being gay.\r\n\r\nThe movie is fast-paced to begin with, but slows down a bit later on. It has the obligatory violent Guy Ritchie scenes that reminds us of the early movies of Quentin Tarantino, but in the end, it is all a bit hollow. This is a movie about greed, about screwing over those with money, or even, those without.\r\n\r\n_Last words... looking for a bit of solid entertainment, a good plot (not too easy to get your head around, but not too hard to loose you either) and some nice solid actors (and actresses), this is definitely the movie you are looking for._"

A great ensemble cast delivering a gangster thriller that pokes it's tongue out at just about everything/body whilst still retaining enough menace to keep it engaging. As ever with Ritchie films, it does run a bit to dialogue - and this one has an, at times, irritating narrative. Tom Wilkinson (\"Lenny\") is quite good as the mob boss who facilitates - and takes a cut from - most big property transactions in London; and he makes a good living from it. A Russian oligarch arrives on the scene and engages Lenny, and his slimy but ruthless sidekick \"Archy\" (Mark Strong) to help his with a fairly mammoth development. At this stage it all starts to go a bit pear shaped and we slowly become aware that there is much more afoot. There are several fun subplots with Gerard Butler, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy and Thandie Newton all having some skin in at least part of the game; and Toby Kebbell is cracking as his dead-loss, rockstar, coke-head son \"Johnny Quid\". The writing is taut and humorous, and the violence much more \"fantasy\" and implied - even kinky, on occasion, than gory. The whole thing is a thoroughly entertaining piece of cinema - complete with killer lobsters and the smallest of cameos from Hugh Grant!"

With no money and trouble coming thick and fast, the three of them will do well to survive the week together, especially since love is once again in the air.\r\n\r\nIt's probably (in a good way) the simplicity of the plotting's that made it such a popular franchise. For the \"Road\" movies are in truth simple frameworks on which to hang the charming comedy contrasts of Hope & Crosby. Though Crosby is not the straight man as such, he's the more reserved part of the duo, his mannered delivery of the lines and his casual approach to the scrapes they get in blends delightfully with Hope's more crash bang characterisations. And of course they are aided by Lamour who acts as not just as a catalyst for some play off shenanigans, but also as the rose between two spiky hormonal thorns.\r\n\r\nRoad To Singapore is far from the best of the series and far from being the worst, but it holds up very well and harks back to a time when harmless innuendo, breezy pacing and a willingness to let the actors ad lib situations made for good wholesome comedy. Good songs dot themselves throughout the piece too, with the stand out being \"Too Romantic\" performed by Crosby & Lamour.\r\n\r\nA lovely little piece that serves as a foundation for a much loved series. 6.5/10"

Jamie Campbell Bower also delivers well amongst a supporting cast of solid British stage talent - a rather menacing Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall amongst them. It is dark and gritty, and stays fairly faithful to the theatrical performance that impresses not just with it's solid performances (perhaps not so much with Johnny Depp who comes across as eerily uncomfortable) but with the super costume and make-up effects, the lighting and, of course, a score that marries cleverly the threatening with the frequent (very black) humour. HBC is probably at her best here, I have rarely seen her more effective in a role and she can certainly hold the attention, if not so much perfect pitch, whilst having fun converting customers into pasties. Like the stage play, it has highs and lows but on the whole it progresses entertainingly enough to a conclusion that I didn't like so much - I always like a good baddie, and these two were certainly of the most creative.

Milla Jovovich and Brian Krause play the two youths while Nana Coburn is also on hand.\r\n\r\n“Return to the Blue Lagoon” (1991) is the sequel to the 1980 hit movie, but bombed at the box office, likely because it’s basically a retread. I prefer this one for various reasons; including the entertaining last act and the simple fact that I favor Milla over Brooke Shields (the latter never did anything for me). Both movies were based on Henry De Vere Stacpoole’s trilogy, although this one deviates more than the first.\r\n\r\nThere are similarities to Edgar Rice Burroughs’ “Tarzan of the Apes,” which suggests that Burroughs was influenced by “The Blue Lagoon” since it debuted in 1908, four years before “Tarzan” (although Burroughs claims that his only inspiration was the Roman myth of Romulus and Remus). (Why Sure!).\r\n\r\nThis is a well done and realistic island drama/adventure/romance and doesn’t deserve its bad rap. If you like movies involving castaways, like “Mysterious Island” (1961), “Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan” (1984) and “Six Days Seven Nights” (1998), it’s a must. This one just lacks the fantasy or farcical elements and is more akin to “Crusoe” (1988) and “Lord of the Flies” (1990).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and was shot on Taveuni Island, Fiji.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

The sun and the moon change, but the army knows no seasons. \r\n\r\nThe second instalment of the acclaimed John Ford cavalry trilogy had a lot to live up to after Fort Apache (1948). So it may not be too controversial to state that \"Yellow Ribbon\" doesn't quite achieve the potential promise that Fort Apache's foundation building had provided. However, here is still a mighty Western of many joys. \r\n\r\nThe lead theme here is the passing of time, of time and love lost, lest we forget indeed. These themes give the film a strong emotional heartbeat from which to work from - even if on proviso it's noted that elsewhere there is not much in the way of an adrenalin pumping action extravaganza. Accepting it as an affecting character piece is something of a requisite if you want to get the most out of the viewing experience, and of course simultaneously getting wrapped up in the gifted art of film making in the process. \r\n\r\nJohn Wayne gives a top notch performance in what is obviously one of the first out and out serious roles that Ford gave him. His ageing Captain Nathan Brittles requires him to put in a very fallible human type of performance, something that he achieves in spades. He's a believable leader who is ruing the calling of time on his career in the service. Yet even Wayne's affecting turn is trumped by some of the most gorgeous cinematography you could wish to see from the 1940s. \r\n\r\nWinton Hoch clashed with Ford on the shoot about various perfections (both parties equally to blame of course), but the final result is incredible. Witness a scene as Brittles visits his dead wife's grave, the backdrop is all purple and red, a storm is imminent, metaphorically and in reality. Has shooting in the desert ever been so colourfully lush? The locations are breath takingly brought to vivid life, Monument Valley in all its glory.\r\n\r\nPicture leaves an indelible mark on the conscious for the art and performances (Joanne Dru, Ben Johnson, Victor McLaglen & Harry Carey Jr bring their \"A\" game), but temper that slightly for as a story it just about gets by for dramatic purpose. Yet of course John Ford knows his onions and structures it accordingly, bringing precision and a genuine love of the genre and the material to hand. 8/10"

Music is by Cezary Skubiszewski and cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos.\r\n\r\nNot a biopic of Harry Houdini, but an episode in his life, Death Defying Acts (a bum steer of a title) is lukewarm across the board. Story charts the years after the death of Houdini’s mother, where he travels to 1920s Edinburgh and falls in with Psychic Tricksters Mary (Jones) and Benji McGarvie (Ronan), a mother and daughter team who spy an opportunity to prise a cash reward offered by the great escapologist.\r\n\r\nWhat is intended to be a searching examination of Houdini, his mental fragility, hang-ups, strengths and etc, just plays out as a romantic period piece lacking vim and vigour. Pearce works hard as Houdini but never gets to grasp the tormented angle of the man, while Jones is miscast and not even her pretty face can light up a dull performance. Ronan is sprightly enough and Spall shows some emotive verve as Houdini’s concerned manager. The moments of trickery perk things up a bit, but even then the makers think it’s wise to debunk the mysticism. The romanticism of the era, and that of Houdini’s place in it, is well crafted onto the screen, but the flatness and confused thematic threads elsewhere leave this well below average. 4/10"

Now I'm not really a fan of this kind of humour, I just don't find it funny - but one has to admire the sheer precision of their performance. The quickly paced, expertly choreographed \"spontaneity\" of it all is precise and impressive. The four brothers (perhaps Zeppo, not so much) each have an unique sort of characterisation to bring to the mix, and Harpo manages a turn on the harp with some skill too. It's the very precision of it all that renders it sterile for me; it could be a comedic ballet with everything so meticulously planned and executed. The humour - which misses just as often as it hits - just seems incidental to their expertise in purveying it - and that didn't work for me either. Zany? Maybe... Funny? Not really..."

Whilst at this swanky soirée, a very valuable painting is stolen and so he, along with Harpo, Chico & Zeppo all pitch in to recover it for their hostess; the glamorous but no-nonsense \"Mrs. Rittenhouse\" (Margaret Dumont - who frequently struggles to keep a straight face during the ensuing shenanigans!). It quickly accelerates into a rapid-fire series of set-piece sketches - and the best game of bridge you're ever likely to see on screen - with some wonderfully timed one liners. I always found Groucho's accent a bit tiring after a while - his really thick New York accent is not so easy on the ears, but that's an incidental criticism of a really fun vehicle for four folks who just knew how to make us laugh. Maybe one too many musical hiatuses that slow it down somewhat, but hey - you're bound to enjoy most of it."

Benjamin Bratt, James Franco, Max Martini, Joseph Fiennes, Connie Nielsen and Marton Csokas star.\r\n\r\n\"The Great Raid\" was based on the books \"The Great Raid on Cabanatuan\" and \"Ghost Soldiers.\" I've read the latter and it's interesting seeing the film for live-action visuals of what I saw in my head.\r\n\r\nThe rescue, along with the liberation of Camp O'Donnell the same day, allowed the POWs to share the truth about the Bataan and Corregidor atrocities. While the raid had no strategic value, as far as winning the war goes, it sparked a new wave of resolve in the war against Japan. Not to mention, it remains the most successful rescue mission in USA history.\r\n\r\nAlthough the movie was shot in 2002, it was pulled from release schedule on several occasions before finally having a limited released in August, 2005, with little-to-no marketing. Was it any wonder it failed to garner an audience and box office success?\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, this is a solid WW2 flick based on a true story. The prisoners of the camp are the survivors of the infamous 60-mile Bataan Death March of April, 1942. The movie's not politically correct in that it shows the truth of the brutal savagery of the Japanese military. The actual raid doesn't take place until the 95-minute mark, but it's worth the wait; the build-up is informational and keeps your attention.\r\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't call it great, it's a well-done and informative war flick for those interested in the subject. It's even better if you've read either of the books on which it's based.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes, and was shot in Bribie Island, Queensland, Australia, with the Manila sequences shot in Shanghai, China.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

In a troubles-torn Belfast, the young Wilbur (Dylan Roberts) finds a ring in a burnt out aircraft left over from WWII. His search for the owner leads him to Shirley MacLaine's \"Ethel Ann\", and our story slowly reveals, via a mix of current and retrospective scenarios, just what happened when and to whom. The beginning is a bit disjointed, the chopping and changing of timeframes and characters happens too soon after the film starts without us having quite enough information to follow the story easily, but once that settles down and the role of Christopher Plummer (\"Jack\") becomes clearer, this makes for an engaging story of loves lost and bravery. It also doesn't ignore the fact that bombs continued to fall in Belfast for some years after the end of the War too. It's a simple vehicle for the two stars, that isn't the most plausible of stories, but it has a gentle warmth that just about carries it off."

        "content": "BARAKA is a 1993 film, shot by Ron Fricke in some 24 countries, that is a sort of documentary on three universal themes: 1) the grandeur of the natural world, from the peaks of Everest to low deserts, 2) the oneness of the human race illustrated by juxtaposing almost identical shots from vastly separated cultures, and 3) the desire for a connection with something transcendent. Shot in 70mm film, watching the Bluray on a projector or a large-screen television offers one of the most visually stunning cinematic experiences around. There is no dialogue or voiceover, no characters, but the enormous amount of footage is presented here in a way that gives BARAKA a gripping dramatic arc, and it's a sequence that, on repeated viewings, increasingly seems the one logical way in which all this could have been edited.\r\n\r\nWith unquenchable anthropological curiosity, Fricke identifies commonalities that link us all. A Japanese mafioso's tattoos, for example, are followed immediately by a shot of the same on an indigenous resident of Papua New Guinea. But it's not only exotic tribalism. A shot of affluent Japanese schoolgirls looking at the camera is mirrored later by an almost identical shot of low-caste girls in Calcutta. Nonetheless, don't expect a mushy call for tolerance; Fricke's editing indeed makes a convincing case for appreciating differences, but there is nuance.\r\n\r\nFricke's occasional use of footage from churches, mosques, temples, etc. is less an advocacy for belief in religion than an extension of the commonalities he identifies. Human beings have an urge for contemplation as solace among the complicated and sometimes senseless world around them, and they draw on inner sources of mercy to go against the cruelty that people show to their fellow man. The consequences of a world cut adrift from calm and compassion are shown during a heartbreaking sequence that ranges from Auschwitz and the Cambodian killing fields to homeless across the globe and teenage prostitutes in a Bangkok nightclub.\r\n\r\nThe footage is accompanied by an array of musical pieces which help to set the mood for each series of shots: minimalist loops form the soundtrack for scenes of industrial production, we hear harsh bagpipes as the camera tours the burning oil fields of Kuwait, and Dead Can Dance's \"The Host of Seraphim\" plays during an indictment of poverty worldwide. Some of musicians involved are rather New-Agey and would never have a place in my music listening, but when integrated into the film they are remarkably effective. The 5.1 surround sound excellently balances cinematic effect and faithfulness to the scenes portrayed.\r\n\r\nI've watched BARAKA many times now, each time discovering many new things and always being moved, whether to pity (Calcutta garbage-pickers) or wonder (the unreal glittering hall of Shiraz's Shahcheragh mausoleum). I would certainly rank it among my favourite films. Will you like it? That's hard to say. BARAKA is my go-to Bluray when friends and family want to try out my fancy home theatre setup with HD projector and surround sound, and while some of them have been just as stunned as I am, others don't really care. Apparently many people, even those with a well-rounded education, don't have much curiosity for things outside their own everyday experience, and so Fricke's survey of world cultures doesn't resonate with them.\r\n\r\n(Note that while Fricke created a 2011 follow-up called SAMSARA, I would recommend staying away from it, as it is less focused and only repeats BARAKA to diminishing effect.)"

        "content": "_**Realistic and potent drama about relationships**_\r\n\r\nReleased in 2007, “Snow Angels” is a drama revolving around a handful of ordinary couples, young and older, in a Northeast hamlet at winter time (filmed in Nova Scotia).\r\n\r\nSome criticize that the film is depressing but it's inaccurate to say the WHOLE movie is depressing. Nor does it leave the viewer in a totally depressed state. There's a lot of beauty and hope amidst the shadows and darkness. Plus it leaves you pondering many things, including the numerous real-life people the characters remind you of. One of the storylines is tragic and depressing, no doubt, but that's not the whole focus of the story (although it is the dominant focus). The picture is about romantic relationships in various stages and whether they're successful or not depending upon their responses to the inevitable crises & temptations of life:\r\n\r\nArthur and Lila's high school relationship is just budding and seems healthy and promising. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile Glenn and Annie's relationship has been devastated by Glenn's alcoholism and anger/obsession issues; Annie wants to move on but takes a foolish course of action. She's not only foolish, but also treacherous! Glenn is trying to recover from his personal demons, he even gets born-again, but for some reason he has a hard time getting over his ex and moving forward with life. His struggle between the positive and negative forces within us all is real. Both Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale are outstanding in their roles, Rockwell particularly so. In fact, I've hardly ever seen such a realistic and powerful performance. The viewer sees his sincere desire to improve his life but foolish and selfish temptations manifest when he's faced with rejection and tragedy. Will he take the wise or foolish path?\r\n\r\nElsewhere Nate and Barb's relationship hits its first major crisis: Nate is discovered to be unfaithful. Barb responds with fierce anger, at first, until a tragedy shows her true angelic nature. \r\n\r\nArthur's parents separate but maybe there's still hope for their relationship and family. \r\n\r\nGlenn's parents are in the latter stage of a committed relationship, which seems to have been successful. \r\n\r\nGlenn's loving & loyal retriever is the anithesis of Annie, who treats Glenn with hostility and desires to move on in life, away from him; although this is understandable, the viewer can't help but empathize and root for Glenn in light of his sincere attempts to improve his life and reconcile with his ex. After all, he's genuine & humble, he loves his daughter (and vice versa) and he's not an unfaithful scumbag. Pay attention to the very last scene to discover the fate of Bomber.\r\n\r\nTake note of the scene where one of the main characters takes down a painting of the cross and there's a kid's handprint on the wall accompanied by the word \"me.” This signifies the turn he's decided to make.\r\n\r\nThe film leaves the viewer with hope despite the foolish, tragic and criminal events — hope that love will triumph, a certain couple will stay together and a youthful couple will make wise decisions and overcome the potential pitfalls that destroy others. It could go either way. Yes, the young couple looks happy and natural together, but every couple is like that in the early years of their relationship. Although the movie shows someone’s hostility toward another, it’s revealed that the person in question used to help the other person focus on the positive side of life and the support was always comforting.\r\n\r\nA young character is shown flirting with alcohol and pot; not all people get thrown off-track by flirting with such things, I know, but one main character obviously did. Will he?\r\n\r\nOnly time and wrong or right choices will answer these questions.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the film I read a story about a recent incident in Arizona that mirrors the main storyline in the film. It happens.\r\n\r\n\"Snow Angels\" is reality. Once seen, you'll never forget it. Some will treasure it. My only complaint is that sometimes the camera bobbles around too much, which smacks of amateurishness. I realize the director was trying to be hip or whatever but the camera should never draw attention to itself. Fads pass away while solid filmmaking endures.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 47 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

        "content": "Sometimes it's not about knowing the right answer.\r\n\r\nStarter for 10 is directed by Tom Vaughan and adapted to screenplay by David Nicholls from his own novel of the same name. It stars James McAvoy, Alice Eve, Rebecca Hall, Dominic Cooper, Benedict Cumberbatch, Catherine Tate and Elaine Tan. Music is by Blake Neely and cinematography by Ashley Rowe.\r\n\r\nSet in 1985 England, working-class student Brian Jackson (McAvoy) navigates his first year at Bristol University - which lends him the opportunity to feature on his favourite ever TV Quiz Show - University Challenge.\r\n\r\nI have never read the book so have no frame of reference there, thus the complaints from devotees of the written source are null and void to me. For I absolutely loved this film, a fresh and breezy coming of age comedy that's tinted with dramatic intelligence. How nice to have a pic of this genre ilk that's not built around trying to lose one's virginity, or standing up to bullies etc. For sure there's a whole load of angst on show, a bit of class distinction dichotomy, the perils of formative fumbling romances, and of course whimsy. Yet the framework of education, the thirst for knowledge and an understanding of the problems evident in the world at time of pic's setting, all make this a smarter than your average bear British rites of passage piece.\r\n\r\nCast are on splendid form to make the multidimensional characters work (each main character moves away from being mere caricatures). McAvoy is splendidly affable as Brian, who is still nursing the loss of his father years previously, and then has to watch as his mother (Tate) takes a lover - the local ice-cream man (John Henshaw). It's no easier at University, where he lusts after the blonde bomber (Eve) when in fact he obviously should cop on to the fact that the girl for him is bleeding heart socialist Rebecca Epstein (Hall) - but she isn't the quiz type! McAvoy has a good comedy way about him, gawkish but lovable and perfect when portraying Brian out of his depth in certain scenarios.\r\n\r\nOf the others it's Cumberbatch who steals the show as Patrick Watts, an absolute toff, an upper class twit who has no comprehension of the working class system and the perils within that structure. He is burned by his miserable failure on University Challenge the previous year, his inadequacies and stubborness blinding him to the benefits that others around him can afford him. The facial expressions, the posh vocab speak and the need to be in charge are brought vividly to comic life by Cumberbatch. Eve smoulders as Alice, but deftly plays her vulnerabilities, Hall has her character down pat, while Cooper, Tate and James Corden leave favourable marks. As do Charles Dance and Lindsay Duncan in unforgettable scenes as Alice's parents.\r\n\r\nThe whole play is covered over with an 80s soundtrack, mixing student favourites with punky pop tunes, while the period detail for Brian's home life prior to going to University (Southend-On-Sea) has been given great nostalgic thought. A lot of the humour is sure to be too British for none UK folk, more so those not familiar with what the mid 1980s were like in Britain, while it has to be acknowledged that where the story ends up holds no surprises. Yet this holds many pleasures for the right audience, so fingers on the button and see if you get this starter for 10."

He asks for Surinder and Taani and makes them promise to get married so that she is taken care of by someone he trusts. Taani comes to live with Surinder but barely speaks a word to him, despite his extreme gentleness and attempts to make her laugh. One day she comes on an advertisement for dance lessons. She asks Surinder to do it. He doesn't care about it at first, then accepts. He sees improvement in her mood, but she doesn't open to him. He then disguises to get into the dance lessons, but the school gets into a dance competition and couples are (randomly?) chosen.\r\n\r\nI saw maybe 300 Bollywood movies, most being romantic comedies. This one begins as a drama, then the mood gets lighter as the movie goes on. The characters are very likeable from the start, and the story development is mostly slow to allow to know them better. The scenery is only the small town they live in, so nothing fancy there, only the dance course is somewhat more colored, and improves a bit as the tension grows.\r\n\r\nBut what makes the movie is the stunning performance of SRK, playing both a shy guy in a strange situation and the bold dancer trying to warm Taani's heart. And Anushka Sharma (in her first role) is totally stunning, she plays this broken young woman in such a moving way, either very sad, a bit angry, lost among other people ...\r\nA special sequence with lots of guests (Kajol, Rani, Bipasha, Lara Dutta ...) brings a happy moment.\r\nVery recommended."

Unfortunately for them, an evil mogul wants the map they’re using (Christopher Adamson). \r\n\r\n“Allan Quatermain and the Temple of Skulls” (2008) was put out by The Asylum just before “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” debuted. The company is notorious for releasing cheap knockoffs of major releases to steal some of their thunder. The Asylum has certainly put out some cartoony dreck (e.g. \"30,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" and \"Mega Piranha\"), but they can also surprise you with some worthy low-budget stuff (e.g. “6 Guns,” \"The Land That Time Forgot\" and \"Grimm's Snow White\"). \r\n\r\nIn other words, this movie is a mockbuster, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it HAS to suck.  \r\n\r\nThe plot was taken from “King Solomon’s Mines” (1985), but it lacks the over-the-top dynamic fun of that movie, which is wildly entertaining.

Simply, this is an howler with virtually no redeeming features aside from being marginally less static than my television screen-saver. The dialogue and score offer little by way of a lifeline for this totally unnecessary re-versioning of a great adventure story reduced here to some posh accents, way too much chatter and hardly any actual vitality at all.

        "content": "As fizzy as a Sarsparilla.\r\n\r\nCalamity Jane is directed by David Butler and written by James O'Hanlon. It stars Doris Day, Howard Keel, Allyn Ann McLerie, Phillip Carey & Dick Wesson. The score features music by Sammy Fain and lyrics by Paul Francis Webster. Out of Warner Brothers, the film is seen as a response to the success of MGM's production of Annie Get Your Gun in 1950, where Keel was also starring. Plot here is loosely based on the life of Wild West heroine Calamity Jane (Day) and explores the relationship between Wild Bill Hickok (Keel) and herself. \r\n\r\nI guess the first thing that should be said is that this is no biography of one Martha Jane Cannary Burke (AKA: Calamity Jane), in truth this is more a comedy musical romp built around that famous frontiers woman, so with it being very basic on narrative and direction, this is predominantly appealing to the film fan with musical leanings. However, on that score the film is utterly delightful, such as it is fronted by the spirited lead performances from Day & Keel and a handful of truly great tunes headed by the Oscar winning \"Secret Love\" (Day luminous and vocally on peak form). \r\n\r\nPic also earns some bonus points for giving Day the chance to play something other than the naive innocent girl next door type (it was a personal favourite role of hers). She gets to be spunky and brash without ever losing that adorable appeal that carried her throughout her career. The play on sexual stereotypes is rather humorous without being twee, something that you feel director Butler was under appreciated for, while Wilfred M. Cline's gorgeous colour photography enhances the playfulness of it all. \r\n\r\nSeen now as a feminist fantasy with a gay following thanks to \"Secret Love\", there's no denying the film is all very Hollywoodized - with characters so animated they could actually burst. But all told, if one is able to forgive and see past its tiny flaws then this is a film guaranteed to light up the darkest of wintry days. 7.5/10"

David Tomlinson and Joe Flynn are on hand as dastardly villains.  \r\n\r\n\"The Love Bug\" (1969) is a fun Disney racing-oriented fantasy that inspired three sequels by 1980, a television movie in 1997 and a 2005 theatrical sequel with Lindsay Lohan. \r\n\r\nThis is a good flick when you’re in the mood for some innocent fun, but I feel the latter three movies are the best ones: “Herbie Goes Bananas” (1980), “The Love Bug” (1997) and “Herbie Fully Loaded” (2005) with the 1997 one arguably being my favorite (perhaps because it features the Dark Herbie and Alexandra Wentworth).\r\n\r\nBut this is the one that started it all. It features a fitting cast and superb locations. It’s a tad overlong though and should’ve been abbreviated by 15-20 minutes.   \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes and was shot entirely in California, including San Francisco, Big Bear Lake, Riverside, Agoura, Santa Clarita, the Monterey Peninsula, Cuddy Valley, San Bernardino National Forest and studios in Burbank.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

The youths were interested in the local Indian burial grounds whereupon they discover some of the remains are quite recent. What’s going on?\r\n\r\nReleased in 2009, “The Devil’s Ground”, aka “The Cycle,” is a backwoods slasher in the “Wrong Turn” mold with some nods to the “Friday the 13th” flicks, i.e. a hulking masked assailant in the woods with a machete. \r\n\r\nWithout giving away vital revelations in the last act, the story comes down to a toxic waste, bitter yokels and some mysterious crows. The Indian burial ground functions simply to attract the out-of-state college students and isn't related to the other stuff, unless you view the grounds as sacred land that curses anyone who desecrates it. Let's be generous to writer/director Micheal Bafaro and go with that.\r\n\r\nThe striking Lee Tomaschefski stands out on the female front as Lisa, although she doesn’t do much for me personally. Meanwhile Maria Gruending is worth a mention as Tammy and I like protagonist Leah Gibson’s doe-eyed look.\r\n\r\nThe filmmaking is professional so this is worth checking out for those who appreciate backwaters horror, particularly of the slasher variety. Despite some eye-rolling script flaws, like the map contrivance and the youths constantly referring to the killer as “the monster,” I’d watch this over “Wrong Turn.” But it’s not as entertaining as any of the “Friday the 13th” movies. For a similar Canadian flick that’s more effective, see \"Butchers\" (2020).\r\n\r\nThe flick runs 1 hour, 28 minutes. It’s a Canadian/Czech production, but I can’t find specific info on filming locations; the credits list the British Columbia Film Commission, so I’m assuming that’s where it was shot (thankfully they don’t show the Cascades or Rockies in the background since the story is set in northwestern Pennsylvania). \r\n\r\nGRADE: C+"

Daardoor warmt de kern van de aarde met grote snelheid op wat zal leiden tot rampzalige gevolgen voor de planeet. Adrian haast zich terug naar de Verenigde Staten en waarschuwt Anheuser, stafchef van het Witte Huis, die op zijn beurt de president inlicht. Adrian maakt vanaf dan deel uit van de staf van de president en wordt gevraagd een schema te maken van de mogelijke gebeurtenissen die zullen plaatsvinden in de komende jaren.\r\nIn 2012 blijkt dat de president opdracht heeft gegeven om 8 grote arken te bouwen waarin 800.000 mensen op basis van DNA, expertise en wetenschap zich schuil zouden kunnen houden. Inmiddels weten ook alle leiders van de meeste landen in de wereld van dit plan af en worden er selecties gemaakt. Ondertussen komt Jackson Curtis in Los Angeles zijn kinderen ophalen bij zijn ex-vrouw Kate (die samenwoont met haar vriend Gordon). Hij neemt z'n kinderen mee naar Yellowstone National Park. Daar worden ze vervolgens meegenomen door het leger en ontmoeten Adrian, die hen de smoes voorlegt dat Yellowstone in moeilijkheden verkeert en daarom geen toeristen toestaat. Ook ontmoeten ze Charlie Frost, die een eigen radiozender heeft en Jackson vertelt dat de wereld binnenkort vergaat. Hij zegt erbij dat er een grote groep mensen is die plaats mag nemen in \"ruimteschepen\" waar hij de locatie van weet. Jackson brengt op verzoek van zijn ex-vrouw zijn kinderen terug naar L.A., alwaar hij hoort dat er een aardbeving heeft plaatsgevonden die een grote scheur in de aarde heeft veroorzaakt. In het Witte Huis wordt duidelijk dat het schema van Adrian sneller verloopt dan ze dachten, en dat door de grote hitte van de aardkern de mantel ook vloeibaarder is geworden, waardoor de aardkorst als het ware \"los\" kan drijven, en dus zal gaan verschuiven. Ook krijgen ze te horen dat er maar 4 arken op tijd klaar zullen zijn. Jackson wordt opgeroepen als chauffeur om de zoons van de Russische miljardair Yuri Karpov op te halen en ze naar het vliegveld te brengen. Hier laat één van de zoons per ongeluk los dat zij de rampen zullen overleven en Jackson niet. Met de informatie die Jackson al van Charlie kreeg, realiseert hij zich dat er inderdaad rampzalige dingen zullen gaan gebeuren, en hij rijdt terug naar L.A. om z'n familie op te halen. Hij gebruikt een vliegtuig en Gordon, die amateurpiloot is, is uiteindelijk gedwongen het vliegtuig te besturen wanneer hun piloot blijkt te zijn omgekomen. Terwijl ze opstijgen is de familie Curtis getuige van de complete verwoesting van Los Angeles. De stad verdwijnt door de aardkorstverschuiving volledig in de Stille Oceaan.\r\nIn het Witte Huis wordt Adrian verteld dat de aardkorstverschuiving voor honderden aardbevingen heeft gezorgd en al 2 miljoen slachtoffers heeft geëist. President Wilson geeft het bevel dat zijn personeel zo snel mogelijk het vliegtuig in moet om naar China te vertrekken, waar de ruimteschepen liggen. Hij onthult ook aan Adrian dat hij zelf niet mee zal gaan, omdat iemand de rest van de wereld op de hoogte zal moeten brengen van de komende rampen die tot het einde van de wereld zullen leiden. De president vindt dat hijzelf daar de aangewezen persoon voor is. Adrian gaat vervolgens met Anheuser en andere personeelsleden aan boord van een Air Force One. Jackson beseft intussen dat als ze het willen overleven, ze de locatie van de schepen moeten zien te achterhalen. Hij overtuigt Gordon er daarom van om naar Yellowstone te vliegen en Charlie te vinden, om zo de locatie van de \"ruimteschepen\" te achterhalen. Terwijl Gordon het vliegtuig bijvult met brandstof, gaat Jackson op zoek naar Charlie en vindt hem. Hij vertelt dat de kaart in zijn camper ligt. Jackson weet net op tijd weg te komen als de vulkaan onder Yellowstone plotseling uitbarst. De familie ontsnapt met het vliegtuig net op tijd aan de aswolken. Jackson ontdekt op de kaart dat ze naar China moeten en ze landen uiteindelijk in Las Vegas om nieuwe brandstof te tanken. Hier lopen ze Yuri en z'n gezin tegen het lijf. Hun vliegtuig is gecrasht. Yuri's piloot Sascha neemt vervolgens een oude Antonov An-225 over, maar heeft een co-piloot nodig, waardoor de familie Curtis en Gordon mee kunnen. Ze willen landen in Hawaï om meer brandstof te tanken, maar ontdekken dat Hawaï volledig is veranderd in een vulkanisch gebied. Ze zijn gedwongen verder te vliegen. Sascha voorspelt dat ze binnen 15 minuten in de Stille Oceaan zullen neerstorten. Wanneer hij door de wolken heen is, ziet hij dat waar de oceaan zou moeten zijn, een grote ijsmassa te vinden is. Jackson realiseert zich dat de aardkorstverschuivingstheorie werkelijk bestaat. Ze storten neer op een gletsjer waarbij Sascha omkomt. Vervolgens worden ze gevonden door Chinese troepen, die bezig zijn dieren over te brengen naar de schepen. De soldaten nemen Yuri en z'n kinderen mee wanneer hij zijn tickets laat zien. Daardoor blijven de familie Curtis, Gordon en Yuri's vriendin Tamara (die geen ticket had) achter. In China, bij de schepen, wordt duidelijk dat van één van de arken het dak is ingestort door de aardkorstverschuiving en wordt het Laura en Adrian duidelijk dat de passagiers helemaal niet op basis van DNA en wetenschap zijn gekozen, maar dat rijke mensen hun toegang hebben kunnen kopen: zij hebben per ticket 1 miljard euro neergeteld. Adrian wordt vervolgens door zijn Indiase collega opgebeld met de mededeling dat India op het punt staat overspoeld te worden door een gigantische tsunami. Hierdoor beseft Adrian dat de tsunami hen eerder zal bereiken dan gepland, en dat ze op moeten schieten. Wanneer Anheuser dit hoort, maakt hij de beslissing de poorten van de schepen eerder te sluiten, waardoor tienduizenden mensen, onder wie Yuri en zijn zoons, buitengesloten worden.\r\nJackson en z'n familie worden intussen opgepikt door een Tibetaanse monnik die op weg is naar de schepen om aan boord te gaan. Ze worden door diens broer aan boord gesmokkeld van een ark via de machinekamer en Jackson beseft dat de schepen geen ruimteschepen maar arken zijn. Ze komen vast te zitten wanneer de poorten weer zakken op bevel van Adrian, die de buitengesloten mensen toch wil binnenlaten. Gordon wordt tussen de tandwielen geslingerd en overlijdt, en tegelijk komt ook een drilboor vast te zitten tussen de motoren, waardoor de poort niet meer volledig kan sluiten. Yuri weet z'n kinderen net op tijd aan boord te krijgen, maar valt vervolgens zelf van het platform en sterft. Nu de poort niet meer volledig sluit, kan de bemanning de motoren niet starten. De tsunami komt al snel hun kant op en water begint de ark binnen te stromen, waarna de passagiers benedendeks door het water waden. Jackson en z'n gezin worden gesplitst doordat waterbestendige deuren sluiten. Daardoor komen zij in verschillende compartimenten terecht. Adrian ziet via de camera's dat Jackson aan boord is weten te komen en haast zich naar de compartimenten om hem en zijn familie te redden. Tamara, die alleen zit, verdrinkt al snel wanneer het water te hoog komt. Jackson hoort van Adrian dat de compartimenten alleen maar open kunnen gaan wanneer de boor uit de motoren wordt gehaald en het hele systeem weer werkt. Met hulp van z'n zoontje Noah weet Jackson dit voor elkaar te krijgen. De poort sluit weer zodat de motoren kunnen worden gestart en een botsing met de Mount Everest ternauwernood wordt voorkomen. Jackson en z'n familie maar ook de monniken worden bevrijd, en Jackson en Kate herenigen zich.\r\n27 dagen later (datum: \"27ste dag van de eerste maand, jaar 0001\") krijgen de arken de eerste satellietfoto binnen, waaruit duidelijk wordt dat Afrika het enige continent is dat niet volledig is overstroomd. Het ligt nu zelfs hoger, waardoor de Drakensbergen nu de hoogste bergen ter wereld zijn. Uit metingen wordt duidelijk dat de lucht weer enigszins schoon is en dat de poorten van de arken kunnen worden geopend. Daardoor kan de mensheid voor het eerst sinds de overstroming weer naar buiten."

It's an easy film to dislike from an intellectual level, artistically as well, while the science fiction boffins no doubt had kittens where the science was concerned. It's also easily one hour too long in length, and come the second half of the marathon it starts to sag. There's only so many times you can watch your lead protagonists escape crumbling carnage - via various modes of transport - before the fun factor begins to wane. However.\r\n\r\nThe carnage effects are grade \"A\" stuff, eye popping and ear splintering, Emmerich is a master at this sort of thing, and with a likable cast comfortably chewing through the safe disaster film making screenplay, it's a very decent popcorn blockbuster. It also isn't afraid to explore some dark moments, all of which - while not all being a surprise - strike strong emotional chords. It knows its disaster movie roots and is happy to tug on them.\r\n\r\n2012 made a $500 million profit, that's a figure not to be ignored. The blockbuster movie loving public lapped it up, they often love this stuff, they just want to see the world exploding and chases and crashes and humans imploding or being heroic. If you have to strip it bare on any sort of cerebral level, then of course it's naked. But fully clothed, attired purely in modern film popcorn clobber, then it's grand dramatic and exciting fun.

It's all going pear shaped marvellously well for her until the hunky and charming \"Todd\" (Tab Hunter) offers her a dreamboat opportunity to escape the tortures of her family life. It's great fun, this - the characterisations are no deeper than a puddle but the pace at which John Waters keeps the mayhem and mischief coming thick and fast with plenty of humour that is entertaining, though admittedly a bit puerile and basic at times, manages to parody effectively quite a few more serious American comedy films made in the late 1970s.

I think a broken nose may have come about if that subject had of been broached... \r\n\r\nOnce Kersey (Bronson hard as nails again) goes about dealing out his brand of justice, the film hits its straps, teasing the viewers with moral - cum - ethical outrage or conversely, vicarious thinking. Vigilante films are always going to swim in tricky waters, provoking anger and heated debate from all walks of the political spectrum, but better to have them out there to provoke a response than not.

It’s not hard to see why, for no matter how much we may moan about remakes and the general languid nature of slashers turned out just for coin, there’s a big market out there for them. As it happens this isn’t half bad, oh it’s all very familiar, there’s another Michael Myers clone stalking the residents of some American town and offing them in gruesome ways. Here the perp is The Miner, dressed up in his work clothes, armed with a pickaxe, face covered by a gas mask that in turn makes him creepy looking and gives him Darth Vader breathing exercises to do. \r\n \r\nThe mystery element is that this new series of murders are being re-enacted from crimes ten years previously, so is the old killer back from the dead, or is there a copycat at large? Enter troubled teenagers, townsfolk acting suspiciously and mucho blood and screaming sitting in tandem together. There’s the requisite amount of nudity, including one of the longest nude scenes ever, while Lussier shows a good knack for blending humour with the terror. The 3D is of a high standard, and the sound mix is incredible, this really is one to give your sub-woofer a work out. It pans out as expected, but it manages to eek out good suspense for its finale and having Atkins and Tighe in the movie is a reassuring presence.\r\n \r\nThe original was no great film anyway, and although this is better, it’s still just a bunch of acting props being killed in different ways.

It includes most of the vital elements for an effective flick of this genre.\r\n\r\nThe basic formula was well established by \"Halloween\" (1978) and the first two \"Friday the 13th\" flicks (1980-1981): A crazy masked killer and a group of youths in a specific environment, whether a town, camp, forest, college, resort, building, etc. In this case it's a mining town, shot in Kittanning and Bethel, PA, and points nearby along the Allegheny River.

(Not that there's anything wrong with BC, of course, but enough is enough).\r\n\r\nBeautiful women is a must for these types of films and \"My Bloody Valentine\" delivers superbly with Jaime King (Sarah), Megan Boone (Megan) and Betsy Rue (Irene), the latter in an extended nude scene, which I think is unnecessary, but some will obviously appreciate it.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the story is engrossing and keeps you guessing as to the identity of the killer till the very end. Compared to the original movie, it’s more compelling and all-around more entertaining.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 41 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"

The conductor (Danny Glover) and two other passengers (Leelee Sobieski and Steve Zahn) come up with a dubious plan that they think will improve their lives, but how wrong they are. Matthias Schweighöfer is on hand as an assistant to the conductor.\r\n\r\n\"Night Train\" (2009) is a suspense/thriller that takes place almost entirely on a train. The set-up is the same as “Terror Train” (1980), but this isn’t a slasher, although there’s a little bit of that. It’s more Hitchcockian, not to mention more compelling. Think “A Simple Plan” (1998) on a train, albeit with a MacGuffin and a mystical element. Speaking of the latter, this would’ve worked better without that angle (for me, anyway).\r\n\r\nDespite losing points for that and the use of cartoonish CGI for the train barreling down the tracks at 200 MPH (which didn’t bother me, personally), “Night Train” is an entertaining ride highlighted by the stunning Leelee in her prime. It’s not great like “Runaway Train” (1985) or even as good as \"Horror Express\" (1972) and \"Train\" (2008), but I’d put it on par with \"Beyond the Door III\" (1989) and “Howl” (2015). \r\n\r\nAlthough a throwaway flick, it delivers the goods if you’re in the mood for a train flick.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes, and was shot in Sofia, Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

The photography here is striking, as is the repetitiveness of their rather pedestrian existence. They spend most of their time, well, killing it! Their perfectly toned bodies frequently exposed to the relentless sunshine - as they do their laundry and their ironing - and to the azure waters of the ocean. For the most part, they are simply bored! It is perhaps that boredom that contributes to the increasingly frustrating existence of \"Galoup\" and of his commander (Michel Subor). It has a degree of violence to it, a physical and  intellectual torment that is well illustrated as the story unfolds slowly but distinctly and not in any way predictably either. This isn't a love story in any traditional guise; but there is affection and sentiment here and as we gradually learn a little of what makes \"Galoup\" tick, I felt a little immersed in his scenario. The music plays a big part here too - not in a soundtrack manner, but augmenting the imagery and standing in for a dialogue that is sparing and effective. It's a slow burn, but I did enjoy it."

Organized as a series of tableaux separated by title cards, IF... spends its first half depicting the harsh rules that these boys live under at their elite public school, and the arbitrary punishments given out by senior boys, headed by the sinister Rowntree (Robert Swann) and the distant school officials. This is all in an environment of bizarre old rituals, Latin refrains, and hardly more intelligible English public school slang (and of course, it wouldn't be a classic story of British public school life without some innuendo about buggery.) In the second half of <i>If....</i>, as the storytelling takes on an increasingly surreal tone where we question what is real and what is fantasy, the boys and a girl from town get their hands on weapons and ultimately commit a massacre.\r\n\r\nThe 1960s was a time of war in Vietnam (and other violent conflicts brought to viewers globally by the media) and youth uprisings in the United States and France. Plus, these elite British school also featured compulsory military drill. In <i>If....</i>, the walls of these boys' dormitory is covered with magazine cutouts of war photographs, as if to say that in a violent world, it is no surprise if the young too made recourse to violence. In this respect it feels very much like a precursor to Aki Kaurismäki's <i>The Match Factory Girl</i>. <i>If....</i> also reflects the new sexual freedom of 1960s Britain, and the frustration kindled in these young men who see such open sexual expression in magazines and town streets but cannot have any of it. There are a number of films from this era that document the rise of a counterculture and more open attitudes, but few are as sympathetic to these young people as this film of Anderson and Sherwin.\r\n\r\nThe only serious flaw of <i>If....</i> is that the main actors are too old to convincingly play teenagers, being in their mid 20s at the time of shooting. Imagine how much more shocking the film would be if it were real sixth-formers acting, though I suppose the (few) sex scenes made this impossible. Still, <i>If....</i> is deservedly a classic."

He hopes to get them to help fund his dockside development, but someone is murdering his men, and although Harold has a good idea who is responsible, he isn't quite prepared for the events that follow.\r\n\r\nPlot wise, The Long Good Friday is a lesson in under taxing the audience, simplicity in structure and forgoing thunder in the name of telling a solid story. The Long Good Friday is a British gangster picture that owes more to the Paul Muni and Edward G Robinson pictures from the golden age than something like \"The Godfather\". Where the characters are men of the street, working class villains who literally could be living around the corner from us, their respective antics giving them a reputation as infamous stars to be feared - and grudgingly admired.\r\n\r\nWhat many modern day film lovers may not be aware of is that \"The Long Good Friday\" had its release delayed, held back a year as Margaret Thatcher and her merry men frothed at the mouth due to the film's portrayal of the Irish Rebublican Army. This was at a time when the Irish troubles were reaching new and terrifying heights, and here in this film, the government sensed a fall out that could have sent wrong message shock waves across the British Isles. This is one of the chief reasons that lifts the pic high above many of its contemporaries, it may be a simple story, but it's not merely about two gangs striving for power on one manor!.\r\n\r\nBarrie Keeffe's script positively bristles with a hard bastard edge, some of the set pieces play out as true Brirtish greats, once viewed they are not to be forgotten. Some of the dialogue has an air of timeless bravado about it, delivered with cockney brashness from Bob Hoskins' Harold Shand. Hoskins is on fire, seemingly revelling in the role and fusing menace with a genuine sense of earthiness, one moment Harold is the bloke you want to have a pint of beer with, the next he's one step from rage induced retribution. Helen Mirren is fabulous as Harold's wife, Victoria, loyal and unerringly calm in the face of the madness unfolding, while the supporting cast are also highly effective, with a cameo from Pierce Brosnan that is icy cold in making a point.\r\n\r\nPerhaps now it feels like it's only of its time, and it may well be that it's only British viewers of a certain age that can readily embrace the all encompassing thread of gangland London at risk from insurgents? But I will be damned should I ever choose to love this film less with each passing year, for to me it only just stops shy of being a British masterpiece, bristling with realism at a troubled time, and cheesing off Margaret Thatcher in the process, hell it works for me, always. 9/10"

Set against a backdrop of religious intolerance, and ultimately a pogrom, this is a clever, engaging depiction of the harsh conditions endured by rural Russians in general and the Jewish community specifically. Norman Jewison contrives to reconcile sometimes quite brutal stories of religious prejudice with a defiantly gentle, joyful communal spirit in a thought-provoking and personable fashion. Jerry Bock's instantly recognisable score - based around a delicate, witty and entertaining lyric from Sheldon Harnick makes this as good as any of the genre and although it does drag a bit at the start of the second act, it passes the three hour mark with considerable style."

Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Billy Williams.\r\n\r\nIn early twentieth century Morocco, a Berber Sharif kidnaps an American woman and her children, forcing President Theodore Roosevelt to send in forces to conduct a rescue mission. \r\n\r\nOn basic terms it was meant to be a sly attack on American colonialism, what we actually get is a wonderful collage of homages to great desert epics of the past - with tongue firmly in cheek. It's funny, thrilling, and is in turn boosted by a soaring Goldsmith score and stunning natural location photography.\r\n\r\nHowever, lets not be swept up in it all to not notice it's a vastly inaccurate observation on US interventions. It is unashamedly a flag waving piece of jingoism, but the myth making gusto of it all, with all its entertainment values, makes it a sort of serial piece of fluff entertainment. Not even Connery's Scottish brogue can detract from the fun of his Berber chief Raisuli - or Bergen turning into Lara Croft at one point...\r\n\r\nBut with Brian Keith excellent as Teddy Roosevelt, historical truths be damned. Seek out the real story behind the events of the story being told here and just have a good cinematic time. 7.5/10"

It needed more meat on the bones (pardon the pun), too mediocre.\r\n\r\nStiller isn't great either, in a part which is basically a watered down version of the role he'd play nine years year, White Goodman, in <em>'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story'</em> - he, surely, used this character, Tony, as inspiration for White? Elsewhere, you have two of the funnier kids from <em>'The Mighty Ducks'</em> series, as well as a few fairly known faces like Jeffrey Tambor (Maury) and Tim Blake Nelson (Roger).\r\n\r\nI get the intentions, but the heartfelt message that (I think) the film aims for doesn't really come out clearly. The ending feels like an unconnected add-on that was put in to add to the run time. In truth, it isn't anything terrible - I just wanted and expected more."

Eddie Albert (Jason), Kim Richards (Tia) and Ike Eisenmann (Tony) are satisfactory, as is Donald Pleasence as Deranian. With that said, I think Pleasence should've been the main villain here - there's really not much need for Ray Milland (Aristotle).

More action-packed events would've been greater, especially as the opening titles seem to suggest that that may be on the horizon.\r\n\r\nThat wasn't the case, yet I still had a decent time with this."

Our pair of kids get to go to Los Angeles for a visit. On their way into town, they become separated - \"Tony\" (Ike Eisenmann) rescues a man he thinks has jumped off a building only to find that it is \"Sickle\", Davis' nephew and Lee's mind-control experiment guinea pig. They drug and kidnap Tony and carry out some fun capers in her search for loot... Meantime, \"Tia\" (Kim Richards) has rescued the \"Earthquake Gang\" from their own kiddie equivalent of \"West Side Story\" and they all set out to find her lost brother. The adult performances are all good fun, the story has a few twists and turns; goats and extortion, and there are some basic, enjoyable, special effects deployed throughout this rather, comically, predictable fantasy. This is a good follow up, an enjoyable family feature."

He realized the reasons storytelling have been significantly important since the dawn of mankind, and devised, as the Brothers Grimm did, that fairy tales and children's stories had to be haunting and entertaining to be both memorable and timeless. This is a great film depicting the growing sense as a child approaches adolescence that their parents and their world aren't exactly as they seem, and that through their trials and tribulations (the 'rites of passage', if you will) they'll reach the 'happy medium' they need to in order to find true happiness in their lifetimes.\r\n\r\nI definitely hope that all of Gaiman's books and graphic novels are made into movies (I most anticipate the 'Miracleman' graphic novels--both those by him and Alan Moore). Ones so well-written would truly be 'comic book movies' worth watching for me."

While there is a lot left unexplained, there is plenty that is exampled about the Beldam and her world.\r\n\r\nThe movie also reminds me a lot of \"The Wizard of Oz\" in a few different ways so its good that there are family friendly movies of this quality that make vague callbacks to classic movies."

It stars Barbara Stanwyck, Barry Sullivan, Dean Jagger, John Ericson, Gene Barry, Robert Dix, Eve Brent and Ziva Rodann. Music is by Harry Sukman and cinematography by Joseph F. Biroc.\r\n\r\nIt's all going to kick off in Arizona between the Bonnell brothers, U.S.Marshals, and Jessica Drummond - the tough no nonsense lady rancher who controls the territory.\r\n\r\nSo what do we have here then? Just another recycled Western plot that is basically the Earp's/Clanton's feud that culminated in the Gunfight At The O.K. Corral? Well no, not really, for this is Sam Fuller on devilishly twisty form.\r\n\r\nFuller gives this particular Western a film noir make over, both in look and dialogue innuendo. Pic is filled with outstanding sequences, be it shocking deaths, bravado pumped show downs or chiaroscuro framing of key characters, no frame is wasted in this piece - visually or aurally.\r\n\r\nFrom a psychological stand point it's a right hornets nest, a meaty broth of cynical observations on love, power and that bastion of American cinema - the Western. The action construction on offer is electrifying, if Fuller isn't dallying with various camera techniques to keep the story on the hop, he's being kinetic with is action filming. All of which is in the Scope format, with the ace Biroc weaving some monochrome magic.\r\n\r\nProbably now it has risen above being just a cult Western classic, Fuller's standing in the decades that would follow this release have ensured that to be the case. Yet it is noted that this holds no surprises in how story eventually pans out, which is disappointing given the noir pulse beats driving it forward. In fact a charge of schmaltz at pics end is justified and stops this being the masterpiece many of us yearn it to be.\r\n\r\nStill, tis a superb genre piece of some considerable substance. A film that begs to be revisited on more than one occasion. Thank You Samuel. 8/10"

It stars Don Johnson, Virginia Madsen, Jennifer Connelly, Charles Martin Smith and William Sadler. Music is by Jack Nitzsche and cinematography by Ueli Steiger.\r\n\r\nDennis Hopper loves film noir, he has been in some bona fide classic neo-noirs, whilst also turning his hand to directing that style of film making. The Hot Spot may not be a total success as such, but it is a superb effort that lovers of all things noir can feast upon. Story pitches Johnson as drifter Harry Madox, who lands in a Southern state town, bluffs his way into a car salesman job, plots a robbery, and then finds that two local ladies - of very different qualities - are about to change his life forever...\r\n\r\nI found my level and I'm living it.\r\n\r\nHopper turns in a honest and faithful tribute to the first wave of film noir, but armed with the fact this was his era of film making relaxations, he gets to sex things up. Blending noir with erotic thriller conventions allows Hopper to pile on plenty of sizzle, which comes in the form of Madsen, who as Dolly Harshaw gives neo-noir one of its finest femme fatales. Overtly sexual and on the surface a ditz, an easy lay, it's only when this part of noirville shows its hand - in true old school fashion - does the character become memorable still further.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side is Connelly's more straight laced Gloria Harper, who Madox coverts, yet there's baggage there as well (is she virginal?), baggage which adds more potency and trickery to this smouldering hot spot hot-pot. The girls are great, but so is Johnson, he broods and has a raw masculinity most fitting for this type of role. It's a shame he didn't do more neo-noir because he has the tools for the trade. Hopper brings sweat, sweaty close ups and noirville fans, while the photography and musical accompaniments are superbly compliant to the required atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe editing is a let down, so many scenes needed to have the linger factor, but it's not enough to kill this fine slice of noir pie. A sexy guy in over his head, devious machinations from both sexes, robbery, arson, deaths, ignorance and stupidity, The Hot Spot is far from being boring! The deliberate slow burn pacing has alienated the casual \"crime/erotic thriller\" film fan, but for those who love and know their noir, the fireplace cinders approach is a joy because the pay off delivers all that we hoped. 8/10"

The sultry wife of the owner (Virginia Madsen) shows interest while he has his eyes on a winsome lass at the dealership (Jennifer Connelly), not to mention a nearby bank. \r\n\r\nDirected by Dennis Hopper, \"The Hot Spot\" (1990) is Southern Gothic neo-noir based on Charles Williams’ 1953 book “Hell Hath No Fury” (aka “The Hot Spot”).  The original script handed out to the cast was by Mike Figgis, but Hopper changed it to Williams & Nona Tyson’s screenplay from 1962 three days before shooting started. I point this out because the entire first half of the flick lazily meanders.\r\n\r\nTake the steamy Southern Gothic of Tennessee Williams, like “The Fugitive Kind” (1960), and mix it with the more modern approach of “Two Moon Junction” (1988) and that’s this movie. It has its points of interest, like the three stars, the sweltering heat of the Deep South, the Hamilton (natural) Pool and the defunct sawmill.\r\n\r\nIt’s like a Tarantino flick in the Deep South, just without the great dialogues. Meanwhile the blackmail subplot involving William Sadler is contrived and eye-rolling. Hopper originally wanted Mickey Rourke for the lead role and maybe that’s what got things off to a bad start. I should add that Johnson is certainly the king of cool here and I had zero problem with him in the role; Harry is just ignoble and therefore contemptible, although he has an impressive kick-axx side to him.\r\n\r\nFor something similar but superior, check out Michael Cimino’s underrated “Desperate Hours” (1990), which was released one week earlier.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes, and was shot in the heart of Texas as follows: Taylor (bank robbery), which is northeast of Austin; Luling (old sawmill), which is south of Austin; and Dripping Springs (swimming scenes), which is west of Austin. The sand dune sequence in the opening was shot at Monahans Sandhills State Park, which is along I-20 midway between Pecos and Midway, about 25 miles from the border of New Mexico.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+"

To be fair, no only is this in that string of unnecessary sequels that Disney did, it is right after they switched from classic cell animation to digital cell animation, but it was 2 years after \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" and that looks amazing.\r\n\r\nThe other immediate problem (even on the cover) is that Mowgli is still wearing his mystery diaper (never established where it came from) instead of actual clothes.\r\n\r\nAs Mowgli struggles with being of two worlds (an arguably great point from the original movie), he extends his entitled behavior to returning to the Jungle, aggravating the village, as Sher Khan returns to hunting Mowgli, extending his obsession / pride (sort of a Moby Dick thing).\r\n\r\nLacking some creativity, they return to some of the old songs (3 that I can think of, \"Bear Necessities\" and \"Jungle Rhythm\" being over used, and \"I Wanna Be Like You\" at the credits of all places) instead of using original material.\r\n\r\nAs the adventures continue it's reveal that Mowgli had no natural connection to the animals, it's just that EVERYTHING speaks English, the other human characters don't bat an eye or lose a beat.  It completely ruins the movie.  At least in Tarzan it was clear he would \"ooh ooh\" to the Guerillas.  What little charm they were able to drag from the previous movie to this one is just destroyed by that.\r\n\r\nThe dramatization of Mowgli's endangerment also has a lesser impact this time, as he's survived before, and this time around we also have 2 other hapless children running about the Jungle who must have been blessed with invincibility to survive all that they do.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying there isn't something to enjoy here, but there is a lot more that I didn't, and there are far too many other movies to see."

In fact, that it most certainly is not in the lower tier of Eastwood Westerns that ratings across internet forums say otherwise. Truth is, is that with Eastwood starring, Robert Duval and John Saxon supporting, John Sturges directing and Elmore Leonard writing, well this really should have turned out far better than it did.\r\n\r\nIn short order it has Eastwood as gunslinger/bounty hunter Joe Kidd who somehow finds himself helping a wealthy landowner and his henchmen to track down a Mexican revolutionary leader - it's a land issue we think.... But once on the trail as part of the posse, Kidd comes to find a conflict of interest and soon enough taking sides is just one of the issues to hand.\r\n\r\nSadly I myself can't join with the band of loyal fans who put forward this as a misunderstood piece of work. It plods along as it works its way through a muddled screenplay, which really is very thin from a narrative standpoint, and ultimately it doesn't pay off for character crescendo value come the finale. Add in that Duval's character is poorly under written and Saxon is miscast and you got a few problems to be annoyed about.\r\n\r\nHowever, the script does have some nifty dialogue, Bruce Surtees' location photography is outstanding, while Eastwood is yet again a magnetic presence that draws you in to stay the course. Action is well enough handled, including a brilliant finale involving a train as a weapon of mass destruction, and there's some weapons of interest to be interested in!. But you feel that there should have been a bit more complexity on show here, and that the running time of just an hour and twenty minutes does suggest, there's half an hour of film that really should have been added here. 6/10\r\n"

Don Stroud is on hand as one of the pompous gringo’s heavies.\r\n\r\n\"Joe Kidd\" (1972) is generally viewed as one of Eastwood’s lesser Westerns when it’s more entertaining than Sergio Leone’s overrated trilogy from 1964-1966, at least in my opinion. It has a notable cast, a superb score and great locations, not to mention being directed by John Sturges, known for great (or near-great) films like “The Law and Jake Wade” (1958), “Chino” (1973) and “The Eagle Has Landed” (1977).\r\n\r\nTrue, Sturges was reportedly struggling with alcoholism during shooting and the story starts to meander in the high country during the second act, but the flick works as a whole and everything ties-together for the climax. Originally, Saxon’s ‘bandit,’ Chama, was supposed to be more heroic, but this was changed when Clint was hired on and Joe Kidd became the amusingly fearless hero, the intermediary between two opposing forces.\r\n\r\nVery little is predictable, from the interesting costumes & weaponry to the bizarre plot twists to the amusing ways the protagonist gets himself into and out of trouble, like the ladder/trapdoor sequence, the swinging water jug scene, the sniper vs. sniper sequence and the whacky train ride.\r\n\r\nStella Garcia (Helen) and Lynne Marta (Elma) are featured in the feminine department.\r\n\r\nAnyone who favors Eastwood’s other Westerns will find a lot to like here.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 28 minutes, and was shot at Old Tucson & Sonoran Desert, Arizona, and Alabama Hills & Inyo National Forest, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"

        "content": "A very good movie could be made with Wesley Snipes, Ving Rhames, Michael Rooker, Wes Studi and Peter Falk; Undisputed is not that movie, and the fault lies not in its stars, but in writer/producer/director Walter Hill. \r\n\r\nThis is unfortunate because the film initially appears to be smarter than the average prison movie. Instead of the usual Force Prized Fights/Involuntary Battles to the Death wherein a Condemned Contestant goes through a Tournament Arc in order to Win His Freedom, we get a state-sanctioned, inter-prison boxing program.\r\n\r\nSadly, Undisputed manages to avoid all the above-mentioned clichés only to succumb to the The Thunderdome. In lieu of a ring with ropes, the bouts take place in a big-ass, roofless cage with barbed wire atop its walls — but why? Why go to the trouble of establishing the lawfulness of the premise only to make the actual thing look like a Texas Death Match?\r\n\r\nAnyway, disgraced heavyweight champion George 'The Iceman' Chambers (Rhames) is convicted of rape, sentenced to 6-8 years, and sent to Sweetwater maximum security prison in California. Chambers asks his cellmate Mingo (Studi) why he’s there. Mingo replies that «it's not considered polite to ask why we're here. Kinda violation of the ethics. You know, the code?»\r\n\r\nNo, I don’t know. What code? I’d seriously like to know, because it would mean that every prison movie where a character asks another character what he’s in there for (i.e., all of them) is in breach of some sort of tacit etiquette system.\r\n\r\nMingo’s right, though; no need to ask when Hill helpfully includes captions detailing the lives and crimes of every single characters — even those who only appear in a couple of scenes. Why exactly do we need to know that the announcer/commentator is a con artist convicted of larceny in 1995 named Marvin?\r\n\r\nMendy Ripstein (Falk), an elderly mobster/boxing fan, becomes dead set on booking a fight between Chambers and Sweetwater’s own state champion Monroe Hutchens (Snipes), so that he can (according to All Movie) \"pull in a million dollars in bets from guards and inmates\" (the movie actually speaks of multiple millions of dollars; either way, that’s a lot of cigarettes). \r\n\r\nChuy (Jon Seda), Ripstein's caretaker or something, says “I talked to the head guard [Rooker]. He’s OK agrees. But the warden [Dennis Arndt] is a problem.” The nature of this problem seems to be that the warden can’t make up his goddamn mind; first he allows the fight, as long as it happens while he’s on vacation. \r\n\r\nHe then backtracks and cancels it. Finally, he backpedals yet again and agrees to it. He’s not the only indecisive one, however; at first Ripstein wants a bare knuckle fight, but then someone complains, Ripstein thinks it over for about five seconds, and decides that it’s better with gloves — so why bring it up at all. \r\n\r\nI understand why they cast Falk in this role, but they needn’t have bothered him for something that Burt Young could have easily handled. As for Rooker and Studi, Hill forgot to write parts for them to play — which is odd considering that Rooker as a sadistic, racist guard C.O and Studi a mystical mentor are parts that pretty much write themselves (and even such clichés, that both actors are more than able to elevate beyond the commonplace, would be better than nothing).\r\n\r\nThat leaves Snipes, who does with his Zen Warrior what he can (not much, since he spends a good chunk of the movie in solitary confinement), and Rhames, who has the juiciest character and makes the most of it, as a man torn between the need to be a \"model prisoner\" if he wants to regain his freedom and resume his career before it’s too late, and his pathological desire to be respected and feared at all costs, something he only knows to achieve through physical violence. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the ugly business of rape remains unaccountably ambiguous. Chambers is unequivocally the antagonist, and Rhames is so good at being bad that it's hard to believe his claims of innocence. \r\n\r\nTherefore, either Chambers is innocent in that particular respect but a horrible human being in general, or he's guilty and ultimately gets away with it, since in exchange for fighting Monroe, Ripstein uses his clout to get Chambers out \"in special parole” (one has to wonder why Ripstein, who can get someone paroled without having served the minimum time required, doesn't use his obviously vast influence to his own advantage). \r\n\r\nWe are supposed to believe that the humiliation of being beaten by Monroe is punishment enough; Chuy narrates at the end that “The Iceman and his manager denied that the fight with Monroe ever happened and the story that he lost was just a big rumour” — and why wouldn’t they? It is, after all,  their word against that of 700 witnesses between inmates and prison staff, not to mention, as Marvin points out, “our friends from Las Vegas, here to witness this competition and report to various cities across our great country. A lot of bookmakers want to know what's coming.\" D'oh!"

        "content": "Why is it always, always so costly for Man to move from the present to the future?\r\n\r\n20 Million Miles to Earth is written by Bob Williams and Christopher Knopf from an original treatment by Charlott Knight. The film was produced by Charles H. Schneer's Morningside Productions for Columbia Pictures and directed by Nathan H. Juran. It stars William Hopper, Joan Taylor, Frank Puglia and a Ymir, a creation by stop-motion maestro Ray Harryhausen.\r\n\r\nThe plot sees an American rocket ship on its return from a mission to Venus, crash land in the Mediterranean Sea near the Sicilian village of Gerra. Some fishermen aid the stricken ship and manage to pull free two survivors, Colonel Bob Calder and Dr. Sharman. Once Calder recovers it becomes known that an important canister brought from Venus has not been found after the crash. However, Pepe, a young fisher-boy who was present at the rescue, found the container and sold its rubbery contents to his Zoologist friend Dr. Leonardo. Whilst in the hands of Dr. Leonardo the gelatin like substance gives birth to a tiny Venusian bipedal creature called a Ymir, but it doesn't stay tiny for very long...\r\n\r\nAs the work of Dynamation legend Harryhausen got more accomplished and praised, it became a standing joke that his creatures were better actors than most of their adult co-stars. That's never more truer than with 20 Million Miles to Earth, where one of his best creations takes centre stage and acts the actors off the screen. It's also true that some, not all, of Harryhausen influenced movies are just thin clothes lines to hang his work upon. Thankfully that isn't the case here, for although it's homage a go go to King Kong, where Harryhausen hero Willis O'Brien pioneered the stop-motion process, Juran's movie has intelligence within its on the surface monster on the rampage plot.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing totally new in this genre piece about mans pursuit of more via technological advancement, the unremitting pursuit of science as a tool or plaything. So where Jeff Goldblum mused in Jurassic Park many years later, about that nobody stopped to ask if they should be tampering with science and nature, so it be here. Where the Ymir creature is whipped from its home planet, starts off harmless, afraid, puzzled and very much a stranger in a strange land, yet is provoked into an aggressive state. This even after we are told that the Ymir only attacks if being attacked first, cue next scene as man who said it starts poking confused creature with a big pole! You would laugh if it were it not so adroitly cunning.\r\n\r\nNot only does the big question of \"why?\" loom large as things spiral out of control here in Italy, but animal rights are also given a poke, as is a nice thread as regards guns. It's just too cute not to mean something as Pepe, quite the capitalist indeed, wants to be an American cowboy. Buying himself a Texas hat he happily starts clicking away with his toy guns like some Western cowboy of the silver screen. You just know what is around the corner, soon enough the mighty army are throwing everything at poor Ymir, guns, tanks, bazookas, flame throwers, you name it and the mighty military are using it. America flexes its weaponry muscles on foreign soil, indeed. Against something that they are responsible for being here in the first place! You would laugh if it wee not so cunning...\r\n\r\nOf course the trump card here is the creature itself because it shows a number of basic emotions. Harryhausen works his magic as Ymir goes through the various stages of its sad stay on Earth. From its brilliant birthing sequence where it rubs its eyes and shies away from the light, to the rousing finale at the Colosseum where rage and anger has fully taken over as the creature fights for its life; on a planet it doesn't know or wanted to be on anyway. This \"thing\" may eat Sulphur, but it has one hell of a personality thanks to Ray, who sat at his table for days on end creating these wonderful sequences for us to enjoy. Letting the creature breath, flick its tale and wrestle other animals. Quite a character indeed.\r\n\r\nNo personalities with the human cast though, Hopper (son of actress and gossip columnist, Hedda) is lantern jawed adequate enough for the role, and Taylor is pretty but playing a totally perfunctory character. While the Italian characters are as stereotypical as they come. But just like King Kong, 20 Million Miles to Earth has many fans who just adore it. More so now as advancements in DVD technology have seen remastered releases (even with a colour choice that's not bad at all) reach a new and interested audience. A fine fine film that rises above its failings due to a wizard at his work table and some brainy cheekiness from the writers. 7.5/10"

The same can be said for Benedict Cumberbatch's Prime Minister William Pitt and for the most part this felt like a chronological history lesson instead of a drama that enthused me with the controversial issues of a debate that took all but a decade to reach a meaningful parliamentary vote. There is little of substance to what debate there was and whilst the film makes no bones about the position it takes, it does not flesh out the arguments out using rigorous discussion or characterisation to help illustrate just why it all took so long; just why the populace were indifferent to these atrocities. I found that this just overly relied on our own repugnance for the subject matter to bother developing the themes interestingly and provocatively - and I found myself struggling with it as it neared the two hour mark. A serious biopic of this visionary and dedicated man and of his friends and of his opponents would certainly make for compelling viewing - sadly, though, this isn't that!"

The fights here are definitely illegal, but they happen in an actual ring — as opposed to Undisputed’s Cage of Death. \r\n\r\nGeorge Chambers returns to prison, convicted of a crime he didn’t commit (unlike the rape charge from the original film). After defending his cellmate, Chambers declares that \"I don't like to see people being bullied\", and although he adds \"unless I am the one doing the bullying\", it’s still a 180 degree personality change. People can and do change, of course, but seldom do they go from Ving Rhames to Michael Jai White.\r\n\r\nIn Russia to shoot a vodka commercial (if only this Isaac Florentine-directed movie had been about a down-and-out boxer à la Apollo Creed), the rejuvenated Chambers is arrested for possession of cocaine (planted in his hotel room) and summarily sentenced to Chornya Cholmi maximum security prison. Chornya Cholmi translates to Black Hills, although the hills, if any, would be more likely to be white with snow; I guess it's just a name, like 'Monster Island' (which is actually a peninsula).\r\n\r\nThis is one of those Russian prisons, like the one in Black Widow, where everyone — warden, guards and inmates alike — speaks proficient English (continuing the unintentional irony, Chambers is one of the few characters to say anything in Russian, in the aforementioned commercial), including the undisputed prison champion, Yuri Boyka (Scott Adkins). \r\n\r\nA far cry from the boxing of Undisputed, the name of the game here is mixed martial arts choreographed like wrestling (complete with ref bumps, which I guess is the only reason why clandestine, anything-goes prison fights would have a referee to begin with); in that sense, Adkins's gravity-defying moves are the best thing about the film, though not quite what one would expect under the circumstances (a gritty Fight Club aesthetic would be more pertinent).\r\n\r\nChambers starts out as a boxer, so his first matchup with Boyka is fought under a \"fists only\" stipulation. In the film’s one instance of Truth in Television, Chambers easily overpowers Boyka; the problem, however, is that White and Adkins are both consummate martial artists, so this first encounter is as underwhelming as one-legged only ass-kicking contest — that is, until Boyka stops giving a crap and starts throwing kicks and knees at Chambers, who on top of everything has been drugged by his cornerman.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, White's casting is a misfire. Rhames can't do half the things White does, but he didn't need to either; his Chambers was the irresistible force as well as the immovable object. White, through no fault of his own, has to pretend he doesn't know zilch about martial arts and then pretend that Chambers learns everything White knows about MMA in an impossibly short period of time."

        "content": "\"Paul\" (Edouard Dermithe) is a young man who comes off rather badly after a snowball fight; one finds it's mark necessitating a visit from their doctor who advises bedrest - on a pretty permanent basis! He is to be looked after by his sister \"Elisabeth\" (Nicole Stéphane) with whom he shares a room. What now ensues is a hybrid of the sibling and the marital as their love to hate to love relationship, bordering on the incestuous (but never actually more than bordering) evolves. Both characters are handsome to look at, there are undercurrents of homosexuality and depravity - moral, certainly, physical less so - but I have to say I found the whole thing just a bit on the sterile side. It's not that their relationship together, nor with the rather unattractive \"Dargelos\" (Renée Cosima) needed any sort of visual consummation - it doesn't; but there is little if any chemistry to raise this above a rather statically, though beatifically crafted, story of people who can't live with, or without, each other. i am certainly no expert on Cocteau on Melville, but I ought not to have to be - this film should be able to stand it's own merits, and for me it is just a rather extended, unremarkable family squabble, with occasionally pithy but all to frequently petulant dialogue that 70 years after lacks any real potency."

Whilst his girlfriend is out of town he meets and beds a fan named Evelyn (Jessica Walter) who turns out to be the mystery caller to his show who sexily requests the Errol Garner classic tune \"Play Misty For Me\". Thinking that his night of passion with Evelyn is purely a one off, he starts to become concerned as Evelyn refuses to leave him alone, and things are about to get very out of hand and become very disturbing for all involved.\r\n\r\nThis was Clint Eastwood's first stab (hrr hrr) at directing and it proved to be a very commendable effort as he directs himself in the picture, polishes the production across the board, and then wrapped the film on time and under budget, quite an achievement and it's no surprise that he went on to be a big hitter from behind the camera right up to this present day.\r\n\r\nPlay Misty For Me is a truly tight and engrossing picture, and certainly more of a character study than its slasher shell would suggest. Eastwood (playing against type) plays Garver perfectly weasel like, and it's because of his selfish sexual proclivities, and all round disdain for his actions, that the maelstrom that comes his way is kind of like the reckoning. The picture firmly belongs to Jessica Walter, though, her turn as the irrational psychotic in waiting, Evelyn, is truly magic, lacing sympathetic sadness with outright moments of terror, believable to the point of forcing the audience into an uneasy understanding. It's a mystery (and a crying shame) that Walter didn't go on to be a big star because the marker for major talent was right here.\r\n\r\nEdgy and darkly fascinating, Play Misty For Me stands up today as a right on the money thriller, and not even the sight of Clint in his over large white underpants can dim the films appeal. 8.5/10"

As good as Clint Eastwood is, as he makes his directorial debut, Walter gives a superb performance as the unnerving Evelyn Draper - one that'll live in the memory, for sure.

Similar films were inspired by the same real-life episode: “Badlands” (1973), “Kalifornia” (1993) and “Natural Born Killers” (1994). Seventeen months after Starkweather’s spree he was wiped off the face of the earth via electric chair. Needless to say, we were wiser then.\r\n\r\nWhile “Badlands” and “Kalifornia” were realistic, “Love and a .45” takes the satirical route à la “Natural Born Killers,” but it tries too hard to be an oddball cult flick about dirtbags, not to mention it’s shallow. By contrast, the contemporaneous “Pulp Fiction” didn’t have to try hard; it just was (the real deal; and not shallow at all). But there are enough highlights in “Love and a .45” if you don’t mind movies about white trash crazies: Zellweger never looked better, not even in “Empire Records” (1995); Cochrane gives it his all; and Bellows works as a likable anti-hero.    \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and was shot in the heart of Texas (Bastrop & Austin).\r\n\r\nGRADE: C/C-"

With the seedy \"Toady\" (Peter Lorre) also whispering in his ear too, the scene is set for quite a tense battle of wills. The cast looks great on paper, and Lancaster and Rains are good, too - but somehow it doesn't quite click.

One of Disney's best live-action offerings up until 2005.\r\n\r\nIt's yet another sports drama from the studio, one of many still to come too, but it's a cut above their previous live-actions releases in this subgenre; even beating 2002's <em>'The Rookie'</em>, which I like tremendously.\r\n\r\nI love every detail of <em>'The Greatest Game Ever Played'</em>, which is about a true story. The score is splendid, the cinematography is excellent and the premise is riveting - even to someone like me who isn't a follower of golf. There are a few scenes that use effects, namely with Vardon, which look neat.\r\n\r\nVardon is portrayed by Stephen Dillane, who is terrific in the role. Stephen Marcus plays Ted Ray, he's another top performer as is Josh Flitter (Eddie) - the latter brings some amusing humour to events.\r\n\r\nThe film's star, however, is Shia LaBeouf. He does a grand job as Ouimet, he produces the goods in all of his scenes. I'm already a fan of LaBeouf's, so I'm glad I can add another one of his characters to my memory.\r\n\r\nThis did not feel like a 120 minute production. Great pacing, great film. Highly recommended!"

The men are shattered emotionally and after it's deemed that their previous commander (Gary Merrill) has been soft with them, there is no chance of that happening with Savage - but is he himself taking too much on?\r\n\r\nSplit into two parts, the first half of pic deals with how a group of men in war time can reach their lowest ebb. Fear of the jinx, fear of cracking under the strain, these men are by definition demoralised. Things are further compounded by the appointment of Savage, who drags the group further down the battered emotional scale. Second half softens things for a short while as Savage's methods begin take a hold, then there's the missions, which in turn builds to the film's revelation, which as it happens lets Peck become a revelation as well.\r\n\r\nDirector Henry King is on form, showcasing the skill of directing an ensemble cast, which sees Dean Jagger add mighty heft to the work of Peck, Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, Paul Stewart and Millard Mitchell. The flying sequences are expertly photographed (Leon Shamroy), with the real footage splicing very effective, while the writing allows the piece to exude a realism factor, which then offers up a more humane war film that is delving into psychological stings. 8/10"

Savage\" drafted into replace an extremely popular, but no longer effective squadron commander. Initially, his hard-nosed approach to them, their training and their attitudes engenders hostility, but over a period of time - and with the assistance of the intelligent camp adjutant/chief administrator \"Maj. Stowell\" (Dean Jagger) he sets about trying to change these opinions (and some of his own) before his entire squad transfers out. Henry King has managed to create a film that unsentimentally encapsulates some of the senses of frustration, fear, low morale and trauma that went with the relentlessness of constant missions - regardless of rank - not knowing who might return. The supporting cast - featuring Hugh Marlowe and Gary Merrill compliment the star well; some excellent original aerial battle cinematography and the Sy Bartlett screenplay has pace and detail enough to make this 2¼ hour assessment of leadership under enormous pressure a thoroughly entertaining and at times thought-provoking watch."

Aided by the magician Sokurah and his magic lamp, they manage to escape back on board with their lives intact. However, the lamp which contains a helpful genie, is left behind in the Cyclops' hands. Once back in Bagdad, Sokurah sets about getting a crew together to reclaim the lamp off of Colossa, but the chiefs of Bagdad refuse to sanction such action. After failing to impress all with his magic tricks, Sokurah shrinks the princess of Bagdad to the size of a hand, then craftily offers to restore the princess to normal the next day. Only trouble being that the ingredients needed for the cure are of course on Colossa. So Sinbad and his men, and the dastardly magician, set sail for an adventure that is fraught with danger... \r\n\r\nStop-motion maestro Ray Harryhausen, for his first film in colour, delves into the mythical legend of Sinbad The Sailor. Thus, along with director Nathan Juran, putting life into the Sinbad legacy that had been viewed as a no go area after less than favourable responses to prior attempts at the legend. Though not adhering to the Persian fable source, the 7th Voyage was nothing like this one and The Rocs for instance actually appear in the 5th voyage fable, Juran and Harryhausen turn the merchant seaman of the origin into a dashing hero figure. Someone that children and adults of both sexes can easily get on side with. \r\n\r\nVisually it's a treat, admire as Sinbad (in the form of a handsome sword swashing Kerwin Matthews) does battle with Cyclops', Rocs and a Harryhausen calling card, the Skeleton. Throw in a fire breathing Dragon, a genie of the lamp, a pretty princess (Kathryn Grant) and a devilishly creepy magician villain (the always great value Torin Thatcher) and the result is unadulterated joy. Some churlish folk will point to being able to see the lines between the real footage and Harryhausen's marvellous creatures, but quite frankly those people should be rounded up and sent to live on Colossa with all the other monsters. For to not appreciate the craft and genius on offer here is as sad as it is foolish. And with master composer Bernard Herrmann laying a brisk mystical flecked score over proceedings, it's a treat for the ears as well. \r\n\r\nWhen you consider the budget afforded this production, it's high quality film making, and it's now, along with the two sequels that followed it, still being enjoyed by those of us who remember before computers controlled such magical things. 8/10"

Sure, the younger twin sisters, Cindy & Cathy, dispute the claims of gross abuse (while admitting Joan was strict), but they were only 3 years-old when Christina was 11 and so weren’t present or were simply too young to know what went down with Christina & Christopher. Another thing to consider is that Joan learned a few lessons on parenting in raising the two older kids and therefore was wiser with her treatment of Cindy & Cathy.  \r\n\r\nThe movie is neither campy nor an “unintentional comedy.” This is a dramatic biopic of the final 38 years of Joan’s life with concentration on the 40s-50s. It’s a great behind-the-scenes look at Hollywood of that period. The viewer becomes privy to Joan’s struggles with romance, maintaining success in a challenging career, aging, finances, male chauvinism and… childrearing. \r\n\r\nWhile Gene Siskel gave the movie a fair 2.5/4 rating, both he and Ebert complained that the picture was too depressing, but that is a one-dimensional perspective. Yes, the abusive episodes aren’t fun, but there are only two really bad ones, the wire hanger and the choking sequences. In other words, there’s WAY more to this movie than Joan being an abusive monster.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the flick is surprisingly evenhanded with the \"Queen of the Movies.” It shows the good, the bad and the ugly, NOT just the ugly. Near the end of the story it’s clear that there was some genuine warmth and care in Christina’s relationship with Joan. The ending, however, put the final nail in the coffin (which I’m not going to reveal, even though it’s historically documented). Yet the film makes it clear that Joan believed in self-made success because she felt it created character as opposed to everything being handed to the individual. So perhaps in her mind she believed she was doing both Christina & Christopher a favor because she believed they had the talent & aptitude to make it in life just fine without any further help from her.\r\n\r\nSome critics, including Siskel & Ebert, claimed that the movie didn’t explain Joan’s abusive tendencies with Christina (and Christopher), but it does for anyone who opens their eyes. She was a control-freak and perfectionist, not to mention she clearly developed a spirit of competition with Christina, as observed in the pool scene and, later, the soap opera episode.\r\n\r\nFaye blamed the director for not reining her in during the two extreme scenes of mistreatment but, while these may or may not be slightly overdone, ALL biopics exaggerate things for dramatic purposes. For instance, do you think for a second that, in “Braveheart” (1995), William Wallace really trotted into a Baron’s bedchambers on a freakin’ horse for a confrontation and was easily able to escape on the horse? That said, I found those two maniacal scenes thoroughly believable. In fact, from my experience these kinds of hysterical incidents happen in practically EVERY family on occasion, hopefully very infrequently (just like in the film). For instance, I’ve had a few shameful meltdowns over the years that I wouldn’t care to elaborate on, how much more so a passionate actress juggling the demands of a Hollywood career and everything that goes with it?\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Dunaway’s performance, she was perfect for the role and shouldn’t be embarrassed by this movie in the least. Critic Pauline Kael rightly emphasized that she gave \"a startling, ferocious performance.\" Furthermore, the movie was a deserved financial hit at the box office and continues to make money decades later as a cult phenomenon. Unfortunately for Faye, it was considered blasphemous to honestly criticize such an icon as Joan Crawford. Evidently people can’t handle the truth.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 9 minutes, and was shot entirely in the Greater Los Angeles area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

It stars Billy Crystal, Gregory Hines, Steven Bauer, Darlanne Fluegel, Joe Pantoliano, Dan Hedaya, Jon Gries, Tracy Reed and Jimmy Smits. Music is by Rod Temperton.\r\n\r\nThe buddy buddy action/comedy cop formula has proved to be a most viable filmic commodity over the years. It gathered apace in the 1980s and right at the forefront is this often forgotten fun little treasure.\r\n\r\nPlot has Hines and Crystal as Chicago cops, tough and full of wise cracks, they are tasked with trying to bring down high profile drug dealer Julio Gonzales (Smits). The timing is unfortunate because after a holiday in Key West the boys decide they have had enough of police work and want to retire there. Can they bring down Julio Gonzales? Can they stay alive in the process? Questions to be answered in an entertaining hour and forty five minutes.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry between Hines and Crystal is set in stone, they are a great pairing and very quickly you warm to them. As per genre requirements some of their character's methods are unconventional. the gags are thick and fast, and crucially very funny - while the support slots are nicely filled (Pantoliano a joy).\r\n\r\nIn the mix as the two cops ponder retirement is the looming presence of two younger cops ready to step into their shoes, which of course makes for sparky rivalry. There's the emotional beat of \"the ex-wife\" as a critical plot development, though amazingly Fluegel is under written and hardly in the piece! And Smits never fully convinces as the chief villain, but he also is weirdly under written. \r\n\r\nBasically if you have a kink for this type of genre piece, especially ones produced in the 80s - and to have an understanding of that decades style of film making - then there's a good time to be had here. 7/10"

One, the movie doesn't necessarily hold up well (in terms of writing, acting, pacing, story, etc.) but in many ways that doesn't matter in terms of whether it's worth watching. It's probably a more important film than it gets credit for. It's hard to understate how groundbreaking this film was for the time, offering  onscreen representation and voice to several underrepresented segments and experiences in society. By today's standards, the romance feels a little Hallmark and Lifetime movie-esque, but in the moment, it was unheard of for a movie like this to have the reach it did with the message it had. I recommend this film to anyone interested in gay cinema, independent cinema, and the journey these industries have taken over the past 30 years."

While it’s a serviceable Presley flick and has its points of interest, it’s the least of the three IMHO with “Blue Hawaii” being easily the best.\r\n\r\nThe serious drama is situated amongst the Hawaiian boating/fishing industry wherein Presley performs a song every 7-12 minutes with “Return to Sender” being a highlight. \r\n\r\nStevens' role is rather small so the focus is on the protagonist's romance with the secretly rich girl. Speaking of whom, two years later Goodwin played Yeoman Colt on the original (rejected) pilot episode of Star Trek, which was reworked into the two-part episode \"The Menagerie,\" premiering in November, 1966. While Stevens and Goodwin are a’right, the female cast in “Paradise, Hawaiian Style” is superior.\r\n\r\nThere’s an interesting scene near the end where Elvis’s character is rescuing the girl and a sailboat runs into their smaller craft. The (presumable) stunt people in the motorboat get hit by the sailboat and somewhat pushed under.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Hawaii.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

I admit that I also like those kinds of horror films, but I can also acknowledge and praise something a little bit more complex, less violent and more 'psychological', which is the case of this film. 'Dorothy Mills' certainly went beyond my expectations and I honestly don't understand why some people are complaining about the movie being 'too slow'. For the contrary, this film successfully manages to capture the attention during the first minutes, which is a crucial thing to do when you're telling a story. If you shock the audience enough during the first minutes and develop a well narrative line that gets more and more complex throughout the end, you're all set, and personally, I think Agnès Merlet and Juliette Sales achieved this perfectly.\r\n\r\nI don't know anything about Jenn Murray, the young actress who portrayed Dorothy Mills. I am not acquainted with her earlier work, but I don't need any information to state that she is definitely one of the most gifted actresses I have seen in a long time. The first time we see Jenn on screen, her character is doing something extremely violent, which provokes repulsion and hate towards her. However, only a few minutes later, Dorothy suddenly appears as a poor innocent child, which causes more sympathy than fear or rejection. Jenn Murray is obviously gifted enough to elaborate a complex character, who never ceases to amaze the audience with a variety of types of behavior through the entire film. Dorothy is a flawless character, not only thanks to Jenn Murray, obviously, but also because the writers did a marvelous job creating her. Judding this film by the cover, one would be inclined to assume that 'Dorothy Mills' is another movie about a bad little girl who kills people and gets away with it because nobody ever suspects of young innocent little girls. Well... this is really not the case. The cover is misleading and it makes it makes it look campy, when in reality, Dorothy is a much more complex character with a lot of things to express. Again, I have a special love for campy films as well, but I'm just stating a difference, in this case.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend this fine psychological thriller, with one of the most complex 'villains' I have seen in a while. If you're in the mood for a good thriller with some well done twists, give this movie a chance."

If that battery is dead it'll have company.\r\n\r\nWhite Heat is directed by Raoul Walsh and adapted by Ivan Goff & Ben Roberts from a story suggested by Virginia Kellogg. It stars James Cagney, Virginia Mayo, Edmond O'Brien, Steve Cochran & Margaret Wycherly. Music is by Max Steiner and photography by Sidney Hickox.\r\n\r\nCody Jarrett (Cagney) is the sadistic leader of a violent and ruthless gang of thieves. Unnervingly devoted to his mother (Wycherly) and afflicted by terrible headaches since childhood, Cody is one bad day away from being a full blown psychotic. That day is coming soon, and everyone in his way is sure to pay.\r\n\r\nAround the time of White Heat being released, two things were evident as regards its star and its themes. One is that it had been a long time since a gangster, and a truly vicious one at that, had thrilled or frightened a cinema audience. The Production Code and a change in emotional value due to World War II had seen the genuine career gangster all but disappear. Second thing of note is that Cagney was stung by the disappointing performance of Cagney Productions. So after having left Warner Brothers in 1942, the diminutive star re-signed for the studio and returned to the genre he had almost made his own in the 30s. He of course had some say in proceedings, such as urging the makers to ensure a crime does not pay motif, but all told he needed a hit and the fit with Raoul Walsh and the psychotic Jarrett was perfect. It may not be his best acting performance, but it's certainly his most potent and arguably it's the cream of the gangster genre crop.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for the film is mostly agreed to be the real life criminals: Ma Barker, Arthur \"Doc\" Barker and Francis Crowley. A point of worth being that they were all 30s criminals since White Heat very much looks and feels like a 30s movie. Cagney for sure is older (he was 50 at the time) and more rotund, but he and the film have the presence and vibrancy respectively to keep it suitably in period and in the process becoming the last of its kind. White Heat is that rare old beast that manages to have a conventional action story at its core, yet still be unique in structure and portrayal of the lead character. Neatly crafted by Walsh around four Cody Jarrett \"moments\" of importance, the Oedipal tones playing out between Cody and his Ma make for an uneasy experience, but even then Walsh and the team pull a rabbit out the hat by still garnering sympathy for the crazed protagonist. It sounds nutty, but it really is one of the big reasons why White Heat is the great film that it is. Another reason of course is \"those\" special scenes, two of which are folklore cinematic legends now. Note legend number 1 as Cody, incarcerated, receives bad news, the reaction is at once terrifying and pitiful (note the extras reaction here since they didn't know what was coming). Legend number 2 comes with \"that\" ending, forever quotable and as octane ignited finale's go it takes some beating. \r\n\r\nAs brilliant and memorable as Cagney is, it's not, however, a one man show. He's superbly directed by Walsh, with the great director maintaining a pace and rhythm to match Cody Jarrett's state of mind. And with Steiner (Angels With Dirty Faces/Casablanca/Key Largo) scoring with eerie strands and strains, and Hickox (The Big Sleep/To Have and Have Not) adding noir flourishes for realism and atmosphere, it's technically a very smart picture. The supporting cast in the face of Cagney's barnstorming come up with sterling work. Wycherly is glorious as the tough and tetchy Ma Jarrett and O'Brien is needed to be spot on in the film's second most important role; a role that calls for him to not only be the first man Cody has ever trusted, but also as some sort of weird surrogate mother! Mayo isn't called on to do much, but she's gorgeous and sexy and fatalistic in sheen. While Cochran holds his end up well as the right hand man getting ideas above his station.\r\n\r\nWhite Heat is as tough as they come, a gritty pulsating psycho drama that has many visual delights and scenes that are still as powerful and as shocking some 60 odd years since it first hit the silver screen. What is often forgotten, when yet another clip of the brilliant ending is shown on TV, is that it's also a weird and snarky piece of film. All told, it is blisteringly hot. 10/10"

The bridge is crucial to the war effort to both sides, but for different reasons, here the narrative is a little complex so total investment in the dialogue is strongly recommended. The characterisations are high quality, even if the war is hell weariness of the American soldiers had been done many times before in other notable war movies. Guillermin thrusts the psychologically hurt soldiers into desperate combat situations, from which we the viewers indulge in seeing the survival of the fittest.

It may not be great like “Where Eagles Dare” (1968) or near-great like “Kelly’s Heroes” (1970), but it’s solid and fills the bill if you’re in the mood for WW2 movie from the European theater. \r\n     \r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes, and was shot in Davle & Most, Czech Republic (the river is the Vltava). Filming was interrupted by the Soviet invasion of August, 1968, wherein Cast & crew were taken to safety via a convoy of 28 taxis.

Raven sets out for the ultimate revenge and dovetailing towards the explosive finale with him is sultry conjurer Ellen Graham and honest cop Michael Crane.\r\n\r\nBased on the Graham Greene novel \"A Gun For Sale\", this is not a straight out adaptation, the plot has been re-jigged with very impressive results. The most enlightening thing I found when reading up on the film was that the studio were so blown away by the efforts of Alan Ladd as Raven, they turned the script around to make him the film's chief axis, and boy what a smart move that was for this is Alan Ladd's show all the way.\r\n\r\nLadd plays Raven with brilliant icy veneer, he's cold and devoid of emotion, his only trip to anything resembling caring is an affinity to cats - because in his own words, \"cats don't need anyone, they are on their own, just like me\", the result is one of the most unnerving killers put on to the 40s cinema screens. Veronica Lake is the stunning female of the piece, she glides through the picture with ease as Ellen, a character with her own issues, but thankfully she's integral outside of any sort of romantic plot, even though she is the only one who gets close enough to Raven to learn anything about what makes him tick. \r\n\r\nRobert Preston as Michael Crane was to be the pics focus but he becomes a mere side part thanks to Ladd's barnstorming show, and unsurprisingly Laird Cregar is suitably shifty as Gates. It's a fine film in its own right, it's tightly filmed, wonderfully scripted and contains a great noir ending, but ultimately it's all about the cold as death hit-man Raven - and of course the great performance by the man who played him. 8.5/10"

        "content": "When watching films by Japanese animation powerhouse Studio Ghibli a number of adjectives come immediately to mind; imaginative, wholesome, and quirky, to name a few. And there is perhaps no more quirky Ghibli film than _Kiki's Delivery Service_.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, _Kiki's Delivery Service_ is a coming of age film, telling the story of 13-year-old trainee witch Kiki who leaves home with her cat Jiji to continue her training. Arriving in a far-off European city, Kiki starts a flying delivery business, couriering goods around the town, which catches the eye of aviation-obsessed Tombo, who is immediately smitten by her flying.\r\n\r\nOne of the big draws of Ghibli is the simplicity of the stories, making them hugely accessible for the audience. In Kiki's Delivery Service we must just accept that there are \"some\" witches and even though people will possibly never see one, they are not feared. In fact, the only fear in Kiki's Delivery Service comes from Kiki's own self-doubt.\r\n\r\nConsidering, then, that Japan is far more conservative than the West - especially when it comes to family values - it is quite bizarre that one conservative Christian group in America took the decision to boycott the film solely for the purpose of glamorising witches.\r\n\r\nBut really, Kiki being a witch is completely secondary to the film. In some ways it could be argued that Kiki being a witch is simply another excuse for director Hayao Miyazaki to view another Ghibli world from the sky, allowing his team of animators to draw some of the most beautiful landscapes in animation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it allows Kiki's comic foil to be a talking cat (who, in the English dub, is voiced by the instantly vocally recognisable Phil Hartman, who you may remember from such shows as _The Simpsons_, where he plays Troy McClure). As well as dominating most of the film's funnier moments, Jiji also depicts Kiki's transition from innocence.\r\n\r\nDespite all of this marshmallowy innocence, _Kiki's Delivery Service_ is still a quirk. The plot is littered with unanswered questions - what happened to the other flying witch who was returning home? - and the final act involving the dirigible is, frankly, too overdramatic and out-of-place with the rest of the down-to-earth storyline.\r\n\r\nStill, it is perfectly enjoyable, and while it isn't necessarily the first Ghibli I would recommend, it is still one that you should see."

        "content": "**_Refreshingly different alternative WW2 drama/adventure_**\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, \"Inglourious Basterds\" takes place during the German occupation of France in WW2 and revolves around a ruthless “Jew Hunter” Nazi (Christoph Waltz), a beautiful young theater owner dripping with vengeance, a German war hero who pesters her and a brutal team of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine.\r\n\r\nThis was my first taste of the popular director's eccentric repertoire, although I've since seen all of his movies. The first time I tried to watch \"Basterds\" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue-driven opening sequence is great but the film seemed to bog down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation and the accompanying interminable dialogue (mostly in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this because I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WW2 film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of generally subtitled dialogue.\r\n\r\nI eventually gave it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the \"interminable dialogue\" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. The drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.\r\n\r\nThere ARE elements that bring to mind \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick-in until the final act, but \"Basterds\" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.\r\n\r\nAll effective films have quality characters and \"Basterds\" has several: The stunning Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor who quietly seethes with retribution; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the brutal Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Brühl as a genial German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.\r\n\r\nLike Tarantino’s other great movies (“Pulp Fiction,” “Django Unchained” and “Jackie Brown”), \"Basterds\" pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the idiotic \"blockbuster\" syndrome that plagues modern cinema with its predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc. Most movies seem like they’re in a rush and shy away from extended dialogues because they fear losing the viewer’s limited attention whereas Tarantino makes them a highlight because it’s an area where he excels. Instead of pedestrian verbiage that merely advances the plot or conveys the obvious, his interchanges are rich with amusement and mindfood.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

It stars Errol Flynn, Olivia de Haviland, Basil Rathbone, Ross Alexander and Lionel Atwill. Music is scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold and photography is shared between Ernest Haller and Hal Mohr.\r\n\r\n1685, England, and Dr. Peter Blood (Flynn) is unjustly convicted of treason against the King. Escaping the death penalty, Blood and the other supposed rebels are sold into slavery at the English colony of Port Royal. Bought by kindly Arabella Bishop (de Havilland), Blood settles down to work as physician to the local governor. But when the town comes under attack from the Spanish, Blood and his friends seize the opportunity to commandeer the Spanish ship and escape...\r\n\r\nAnd Thus Captain Blood Began His Career Of Piracy. . . With A Ship, A Handful Of Men, And A Brain. . . \r\n\r\nIt could all have been so different had Robert Donat not turned down the role of Captain Blood. In came Flynn at the last minute, a swaggering superstar was born and classic cinema got a handful of truly rousing swashbucklers that continue to delight millions even today. Not to mention it also brought further notice of de Havilland's ability, with this picture the first of eight she would make with Flynn. Even though it was seen of something of a gamble for Warner Brothers at the time, the film actually isn't that big in budgetary terms, all the remarkable, then, that Curtiz and his team have fashioned such an entertainingly rousing picture.\r\n\r\nAlthough Flynn gleefully dominates proceedings, and in the process gives the film its only real flaw by rendering much of the other characters to being like awe-struck observers, much of the credit for Captain Blood's success is down to Robinson's screenplay. Running at just over two hours in length, film is chocked full of action, plot and asides to the British monarchy of the 17th century, deftly split into two halves by the wily Curtiz. First half establishes the major players and incidence, taking a good honest man in a hot political climate and forcing him to go rogue. This then fills the second part as Blood becomes the feared pirate of the high seas, and then ultimately his journey back to a life of normality and love flecked happiness. \r\n\r\nIn amongst this journey to piracy and back, film is decked out with moments of spectacle. Be it Flynn swishing and swashing with blade, or swinging in on a rope, or the sight of cannons blasting away in tall ship duels, Curtiz ensures the pace is brisk and the adrenaline is often stirred. In the mix is the chemistry between Flynn and de Haviland, which obviously hits the ground running, and two deliciously shifty turns from Messrs Atwill and Rathbone. Stunts are aplenty and although the sets are at times at the bare minimum, Curtiz and his photographers get maximum impact by going for a near Expressionist style. All of which is scored with thunderous verve by master composer Korngold. \r\n\r\nFlynn would better this with both \"The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)\" and \"The Sea Hawk (1940)\", but Captain Blood is undeniably the influential template. 9/10"

It does still, however, demonstrate clearly what must have been the feelings of despair and frustration when the gates are heard to close and the prisoners' freedom lies tantalisingly but inaccessibly close. Eric Portman and Lionel Jeffries steal this for me (I always found John Mills just a touch too arrogant and superior). Once the castle is up to full strength and the inmates start to collaborate, this become an excellent showcase for what can be done when there is a will. There is plenty of humour too - the \"croque mort\" joke still makes me laugh even now."

John Saxon plays the local detective.\r\n\r\n“Black Christmas” (1974) obviously influenced “Halloween” (1978), e.g. the closet scene, but was influenced itself by psycho slasher flicks like “Psycho” (1960), “Dementia 13” (1963) and “Silent Night, Bloody Night” (1972).\r\n\r\nHonestly, the 2006 remake has a more absorbing story which, to me, is the best indicator of a quality movie. This version is dull by comparison, particularly the first half, but it picks up steam in the second. And the open-ended climax is interesting. \r\n\r\nBut I strongly prefer the female cast in the remake; they're just all-around superior IMHO. Of course Olivia Hussey is attractive in this rendition, albeit cold, and Lynne Griffin as Clare is winsome, although her part is small. Andrea Martin (Phyl) comes across as a shorter version of Cher with short, curly hair. Unfortunately, Margot Kidder as Barb is one of the most obnoxious characters in cinema, a real turn-off (so is Mrs. Mac, but less so). Thankfully, Barb's only prominent through the first half.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot in Toronto.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-"

        "content": "Black Christmas decorates traditional festivities with blood, suffocation and disturbing phone calls. Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! And have a slashin’ good time! The slasher sub-genre was most proficient during the mid-to-late 70s, with ‘Texas Chainsaw Massacre’, ‘Halloween’ and a plethora of spicy Argento features to add a worldly aesthetic. However, one film that innovated the tropes and traits commonly found in the aforementioned titles, was Bob Clark’s Black Christmas. A horror “slasher” (if you can classify it as that...) where an anonymous serial killer remains secluded in a sorority house, gradually picking off the girls one by one. Just in time for Santa to come down that warmly lit chimney and deliver them coffins wrapped up in cute little bows.\r\n\r\nTo say that Black Christmas was revolutionary and a blooded sprout for the blossoming sub-genre to come, would be an understatement. A nameless unknown killer that exhumes mental instability? Check. An expendable cast of characters that stupidly investigate ominous sounds by themselves? Check. Excruciating tension with every camera movement? Absolutely! Surprisingly, now that I’ve witnessed various films during the conception of a horror movement, it’s incredibly easy to see how influential Black Christmas is. Not for its innovative concept, as other simpler thrillers utilise slashing techniques with efficiency (‘Psycho’), but rather for its technical proficiency.\r\n\r\nClark’s direction, whilst unpolished, is solid throughout. Taut camera pans to explore the darkened hallways of the sorority house. Minimal sound editing to heighten the suspense. Excellent use of shadows to illustrate the antagonist’s anonymity. Sublime POV perspective to place the viewer in the shoes of the killer. And a ramped up conclusive act that will have anyone watching perched on the edge of their seats eagerly anticipating to unwrap the plot twist, even if that narrative turn was predictable from the offset. The camera can be visible on specific occasions, mostly through reflections in picture frames as it glides through hallways. Emphasising that unrefined quality of Clark’s novice-like direction. It does give the feature some flavour, perhaps not the jolly festivities one was yearning for. More egg nog than champagne.\r\n\r\nYet what really injected some holiday spirit into the story, were the characters. Uniquely all acquiring a distinguishable personality that made them different and relatable. The shady drunk friend or the intellectual gal who has all the common sense (that is until she goes wandering by herself...!). The point is, they were all memorable, and that’s a rare achievement in slashers. The second act, where the campus police become involved, does stagnate the overall pace with minimal storytelling momentum. Fortunately the third act immediately picks it back up for an explosive bauble of...slashing.\r\n\r\nSo despite the lack of actual slashing, overall unrefined quality and inconsistent pacing, it’s an extremely enjoyable horror flick that takes a gentle holiday season and turns it into a crazy murder-sesh. Perhaps my new annual Christmas film? We’ll see...! I am sadistic after all!"

It could have survived that unlikely coincidence if left on its own, but then there came a point when suddenly I knew how it was going to end and I thought, “Surely not!” But yes, the reversal at the end that I suppose was to provide karma and balance instead seemed to me to be amateurish and, as noted a moment ago, horrifyingly predictable.\r\n\r\nOh well."

        "content": "Experience has taught me never to trust a policeman. Just when you think one's all right, he turns legit.\r\n\r\nOut of MGM, The Asphalt Jungle is directed by John Huston and based on the novel of the same name by W.R. Burnett. It stars Sterling Hayden, Jean Hagen, Sam Jaffe, Louis Calhern, James Whitmore, Teresa Celli, and in a minor but important role, Marilyn Monroe. Miklós Rózsa scores the music and Harold Rosson photographs it in black & white. Plot sees Erwin \"Doc\" Riedenschneider (Jaffe) leave prison and quickly assemble a gang to execute a long in gestation jewellery heist. However, with suspicion rife and fate waiting to take a hand, the carefully constructed caper starts to come apart at the seams.\r\n\r\nJohn Huston liked a tough movie, having given film noir in America a jump start with The Maltese Falcon in 1941, he also that same year adapted W.R. Burnett's novel High Sierra. Burnett also had on his CV crime classic stories Little Caesar & Scarface, so it's no surprise that Huston was drawn to The Asphalt Jungle. As it turned out, it was a match made in gritty urban heaven.\r\n\r\nThe Asphalt Jungle was one of the first crime films to break with convention and tell the story from the actual side of the criminals. Where once it was the pursuing law officers or private detectives that were the heavy part of the plotting, now under Huston's crafty guidance we have a study in crime and a daring for us to empathise with a bunch of criminals, villains and anti-heroes. As a group the gang consists of very differing characters, and yet they have a common bond, for they each strive for a better life. Be it Hayden's luggish Dix, who dreams of buying back his father's horse ranch back in Kentucky, or Jaffe's Doc, who wants to retire to Mexico and surround himself with girls - it's greed and yearning that binds them all together - With alienation and bleakness, in true film noir traditions, featuring heavily as the plot (and gang) unravels.\r\n\r\nWith gritty dialogue and atmospherically oozing a naturalistic feel, it's also no surprise to note that Huston's movie would go on to influence a ream of similar type films. Some good, some bad, but very few of them have been able to capture the suspense that is wrung out for the actual heist sequence in this. Fabulous in its authenticity, and with that out of the way, it then sets the decaying tone for the rest of the piece. Interesting to note that although we are now firmly in the lives of the \"gang\", including their respective women (Hagen, Monroe & Celli all shining in what is a very macho movie), we still know that the society outside of their circle is hardly nice either! This is stripped down brutalistic film noir. Merciless to its characters and thriving on ill fate, and closing with a finale that is as perfect as it gets, this is a top line entry in what is the most wonderful of film making styles. 9.5/10"

Unfortunately it's no masterpiece or close to being in the upper echelon's of each actor's respective works. But that doesn't make it a bad film.\r\n\r\nA change of director saw Blake Edwards replaced by Richard Benjamin after Eastwood and Edwards, ahem, couldn't see eye to eye, so that immediately put the film on the back foot in many critic's eyes. Ironically Benjamin does OK - working from Edwards' script (there's a whole bunch of back stories and tittle-tattle assigned to this film if you care to search for it). Lots of fun here, though, as Clint and Burt, one a cop, the other an ex-cop turned PI, reluctantly team up to cut a swathe through the gangsters ruling the roost in prohibition era Kansas City.\r\n\r\nEastwood does his straight backed machismo act, throwing awesome punches along the way, while Reynolds is wonderfully cheerful as a tough guy who all things considered, would rather not get hurt! The script is full of zingers, delivered with customary sardonic self parody by the stars, while the roll call of supporting actors is not to be sniffed at. Period detail is high end, with Nick McLean's photography carrying the requisite neo-noir impact, while the music tracking is pleasingly nostalgic.\r\n\r\nIt's over the top of course and needlessly convoluted as per its yearning to be noirish, yet if you can cut back your expectation levels? And you can simply enjoy the sight of Eastwood and Reynolds having fun romping in this period? Then you just might enjoy this more than you dared to believe. 7/10"

There's not any star performers behind those two, though Richard Roundtree and Rip Torn are alright. One positive, though, is the 1930s set design, which I really liked.\r\n\r\nNot the most memorable flick, you could say it ought to be due to the double act up top, but I still found it to be a satisfactory watch."

It's both a high school dramedy and a second chance fantasy. There are elements of films like \"Back to the Future\" (1986) and \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" (1986), but the uniqueness here is that the protagonist doesn't go back in time, but rather stays in the current day and appears to his family & friends as 17 years-old, even though he's really 37. With one exception, no one knows who he really is.\r\n\r\nEfron, who was only 21 during filming, easily carries the film while Mann is one of the most winsome women to walk the Earth.

But that is not necessary to enjoy this well made production; it merely makes we wish I could take my favorite parts from all three versions to create a new whole. Failing that, I will merely say that this production, as with the others, should be acceptable to Jane Austen lovers who aren’t mortified by the least changes to her books.\r\n\r\nI don’t know how easy it might be to track down this movie. As I understand it, it was originally released on British TV, but PBS in the United States had shown an interest due to a popularity of Jane Austen adaptations at the time, so that had allowed for an increased budget to film at actual sites in the book, built up some interest, and then was released as a feature film in theaters before it appeared on PBS, complete with an introduction by Russell Baker. \r\n\r\nA lot of actresses auditioned for the lead role.

Led by Capt. John Colby (Michael Caine) the prisoners agree, but there's more than just propaganda at stake here.\r\n\r\nDirected by John Huston in the twilight of his career, Escape To Victory, in spite of it being a perennial Bank Holiday staple viewing in the UK, is a film that's often used as a kicking post by stuffy critics. It's hard to understand why such a fun and harmless piece can cause such derision in cinematic circles. It can't be expectation because when you read the plot and see that Sylvester Stallone is playing as the goalkeeper, and that a tubby 48 year old Caine is the captain of this soccer team, well surely you know this film isn't all about about cranial depth encompassing the propaganda machinations of the Nazi regime.\r\n\r\nUsing real footballers (notably Pelé, Bobby Moore and Osvaldo Ardilies) is what makes Escape To Victory work as entertainment for so many people in the UK. Huston, much like Stallone, hadn't got a clue how to make a football based movie. In stepped the footballers to choreograph the films football sequences - sequences that give the film some truly memorable moments (Pelé overhead kick, Ardiles rainbow flick, and erm, a Stallone penalty save). They couldn't act for toffee, none of them, but that's where Caine comes in. Guiding them through their scenes, Caine was highly thought of on the set by the players, a sort of father figure by all accounts, and not just on the set, but in the bar as well. Stallone excepted (he was off doing his own thing most of the time), it was a happy shoot, and this shines bright in the movie, with the non actors growing in confidence as the movie progresses. So while the film ultimately deals in escapist fun, it's not without moments of poignancy too. A sacrificial break for the war effort induces winces across the board, whilst the arrival of the Eastern Block players from the work camps demands our utmost heartfelt thoughts.\r\n\r\nSo is Escape To Victory a great film? No, of course not. But it is a darn good one. A film that's easy to lose oneself in during the holiday periods. With Caine flicking the eff off Vs, Max Von Sydow being classy as usual and some legendary footballers strutting their stuff, what's not to enjoy? Really? 7.5/10"

Music is by Hugo Friedhofer and cinematography by James Wong Howe.\r\n\r\nA talented boxer's career begins to spiral out of control when financial hunger, matters of the heart and a shady promoter begin to take a hold.\r\n\r\nViewing it now, Body and Soul looks to be chock full of boxing movie clichés, which of course wasn't the case back in the 40s. Such as it is with the year of release, it has been honourably inserted into the film noir pantheon. If that's worthy - and many of the noir bible writers seem to think so - is up to the individual viewer to decide, what is apparent though is this is a fine piece of film making regardless of genre or style assignment.\r\n\r\nCharlie Davis' (Garfield in a worthy Oscar Nominated performance) descent down a crooked path is certainly noir in plot terms, and it makes for riveting viewing. The screenplay for the time is very choice and worthy, focusing as it does on corruption and violence within the sporting world. The look of the pic is that of realism, Rossen and Howe mixing elegiac beauty with fluent fight sequences (of which there aren't actually many), the monochrome sharp as a left hook.\r\n\r\nThere's no sentimentality on show, this is stripped bare to show the dark that lurks beneath the cheering crowds and sensational advertisement posters. Pic pulses with the beat of the street, the sweat is from those trying to make a living, all while anti capitalism seeps from every frame. The finale drives home a point - consistent with Rossen in general - and even though pic has a very stage bound core, the craft from all involved ensures it never hurts the dramatic worth. 7.5/10"

He is the down at heel, amateur boxer \"Charley\" who lives with his decent and upstanding mother \"Anna\" (Anne Revere) pretty much hand to mouth. When he wins an amateur bout, promoter \"Quinn\" (William Conrad) picks him up and starts him earning a little from his fights. Accompanied by his friend \"Shorty\" (Joseph Pevney) and his gal \"Peg\" (Lilli Palmer) he starts to attract attention, and when the big time looms he agrees a deal with \"Roberts\" (Lloyd Goff) and suddenly finds that his standards of morality and decency start to become compromised. His new found mentor is ruthless and his friends are gradually marginalised or ignored. Can a tragedy very close those to home open his eyes? This is a great story of grit and determination, of love, loyalty and manipulation and Robert Rossen keeps the pace moving really well. The cast is small, and the story tightly woven around some strong characters and a moral many can easily understand - money being the root of all evil, however well intentioned the earning of it. It's well scored and the production is photographed cleverly, at times intimately, making for a superior tale well worth watching."

Now, I understand that Disney puts out a lot of things with different companies. But Midnight Madness was released officially by the mouse. This is the first Disney movie that I have seen with such overt sexual content. It's wonderful!\r\n\r\nThe plot is in the same vein as movies like Cannonball Run or It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. This movie just mixes in a bit of Animal House and other College Comedies of the era. Five teams of bombastic stereotypical young-adults set out on a treasure hunt. They follow clues that lead them to locations with more clues. The winners are given a trophy. The secondary plot follows Adam and his brother Scott as they try to bond.\r\n\r\nThe teams are color coded. Green, Blue, Red, White and Yellow. The Green team is the Jocks. Your stereotypical meat-heads appropriately driving a cropped VW Bug called the Meat Wagon. Dirk Blocker plays Blaylock who has some hilarious scenes at a Pabst Blue Ribbon factory. Easily the best jock. The Blue team are jerks. Stephen Furst of Animal House is the leader. He is short tempered and seems unenthused. The Red team is the female group. Their memorable members are these obese twins that giggle, a lot. The White team are nerds. Their led by Eddie Deezen. \r\n\r\nThe Yellow team is our star team. This is the featured team of the film. It features your stars like David Naughton, Debra Clinger, David Damas, Michael J. Fox and Joel Kenney as Flynch. Flynch is your McLovin' character. Fox is making his film debut in Midnight Madness. It's also an early feature that cameos Paul Rubens before his Pee-Wee Herman fame. \r\n\r\nMidnight Madness is fun. It's a comedy with light raunch that is entertaining above all things. It has it's issues. But all of that is overshadowed by the fact that this is a Disney movie with boob jokes! You can't beat it."

        "content": "A Christmas Carol sings the haunted verses of Dickens through disjointed emotionless motion capture. “Bah! Humbug!” Zemeckis had always been fascinated with digital cinema. ‘The Polar Express’ was technological innovation at its more pure, yet ‘Beowulf’ stabbed itself through contrived art direction that failed to suit the dark environment it was showcasing. So when he heard the “House of Mouse” were adapting Dickens’ universally known tale (again...), he clearly joyfully jumped at the chance of producing more digital art. The inevitable question though is: why? Does a Victorian-era Christmas story warrant the unrefined technological advancement of motion capture? Yes and no, is the answer.\r\n\r\nThe tale itself remains intact, following closer to Dickens’ words than any other adaptation that preceded this. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge encounters various spirits that show the repercussions of his selfish acts, in a bid to rid the evils of ignorance and want. I’ve seen it. You’ve seen it. Your nan has definitely seen it. And probably your pet dog too. Whether it be live-action, Mickey Mouse or The Muppets, you have almost indefinitely seen an adaptation of this famous novella. It’s an important moral that warrants the several iterations over the course of cinema, teaching families the significance of generosity and Christmas spirit.\r\n\r\nMuch like its source material however, it’s a dark tale. Ghostly ghouls visiting an elderly lonely man, including his deceased business partner entrapped in shackles and the shadow of Sauron succumbing Scrooge to the depths of Mordor’s burning fires. Zemeckis took the core tone of Dickens’ novella and merged it with Disney’s typical holiday whimsicality. The end result? Inconsistent. It’s either too dark for children or too joyous for adults. The two jarring tones rarely worked, producing a conflicting adaptation. One moment Scrooge is dealing with a prostitute dragged away in a straining jacket. The next scene? Children having a snowball fight to the merry notes of Silvestri’s score. Neither producing an entirely cheerful Christmas flick or faithful replication. I’d rather have a 15-rated horror adaptation of A Christmas Carol, as intended of course.\r\n\r\nNow for the motion capture. It is what it is I suppose. A technical achievement for its time, utterly outdated a decade later. Character models were stilted. Eyes lacked any expression whatsoever. When close to candle lighting, resembled waxworks. The Ghost of Christmas Past just looked terrible, with its face mismatching the rest of its anthropomorphic candle body. Environmentally speaking, the scenery and inanimate objects were stunningly designed. It really felt like Christmas in Victorian-era London. Just a shame that Zemeckis only tested the limitations of animation through scenes of padding. Scrooge chased by a grim reaper for five minutes. Scrooge flying around London for three minutes. Scrooge slowly becoming Jim Carrey for the film’s entirety. Seemed like additional efforts for gimmicky 3D extravaganza than actual substance.\r\n\r\nFortunately the voice acting was perfect. Carrey and his multitude of personas rarely matched Scrooge’s mundane lifestyle. But that’s why it worked so well! The various voices of the ghosts as well tested his voicing talent remarkably. Oldman as Cratchit added a touch of humility to the story, and again, suited the character perfectly.\r\n\r\nA Christmas Carol is a smorgasbord of tonal clashes and technical anomalies. For every fantastic aspect is a tiresome trope. The gorgeous scenery design is counteracted by horrific motion capture. The source material’s darkness is restrained by forced whimsicality in an attempt to appeal to the masses. It’s not the ideal Christmas present I asked for, but I can make do with its contents. Bah! Humbug!"

Elsewhere, Keenan Wynn plays Alonzo Hawk - he is perfect for that role. Nancy Olson (Betsy) and Tommy Kirk (Biff) are also recognisable Disney faces, though it's MacMurray and Wynn who are the standouts by quite some distance.\r\n\r\nThe special effects haven't aged well at all but I can forgive that. However, the editing is very choppy when the Flubber is in use. I get why, of course, but I feel they could've sharpened the edits up a tad.\r\n\r\nThe main part that I'll remember from this is the humour, which is nicely crafted. There's a lot of set pieces with the Flubber and basically all of them give laughs to some degree. If it wasn't for the fun, I'd be rating this lower - especially after the somewhat out of place ending.\r\n\r\nI prefer the remake with Williams, though that one leaves a similar impression - with the previously mentioned actor elevating that film up tremendously. This, for a special effect-filled production from 1961, is solid."

His best pal \"Jude\" (yep, there's a trend here - Jude Law does this bit) is related to gangster \"Ray\" (Winstone) and so he takes this plan to him. Next thing they are making £15k per week and his place in the organisation is looking a bit more assured. Thing with \"Jonny\" is, though, he doesn't stop at a winner - and when the banks savvy up to their wheeze and stop delivering pre-activated credit cards, he and \"Jude\" step up their game and thereby annoy fellow gangland kingpin \"Sean\" (Pertwee) and so a bit of a turf war ensues. I struggled with the rather amateur style of this right from the start. It's narrated now and again by a clown-clad \"Jonny\" (which does make sense at the end) but for the remainder of this rather episodically staccato effort, the story can't quite decide if it's a comedy, or a thriller, or a drama - it's just a hotchpotch of actors each doing the odd scene or two to augment a pretty nondescript story led by the always underwhelming Winstone and supplemented by an underperforming Law. It's pretty rudderless throughout and by the conclusion I really couldn't care less who was singing the karaoke."

A beach patrol chief (John Barrowman) and a paleontologist (Jenny McShane) team-up to see if the megalodon actually exists. It does and it’s feeding on beachgoers.\r\n\r\n“Shark Attack 3: Megalodon” (2002) is not as bad as armchair critics say or as amusing as its supporters say in a “so bad it’s good” way. It’s somewhere in between. Jenny McShane returns from the first flick (1999), but the film’s not as good. Not that the first one was great or anything, but at least it had an original plot. This one rips-off “Jaws” too much, including the similar-sounding shark music. It’s also predictable. For instance, if the initial megalodon discovered is a baby, what do ya think that means? Nevertheless, the scene done at the 1-hour mark is effective.   \r\n\r\nOn the female front, Jenny’s three years older here and not as curvy or alluring. There are several glimpses of bikini-clad women in the periphery but they’re generally second rate with maybe one or two brief exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe movie was shot in Bulgaria, but the Mexican flag is shown in as many scenes as possible to convince viewers that it’s Mexico. I didn’t have a problem with this because the scenery was a decent stand-in for Mexico, it’s just that most of the actors are Eastern Europeans who are badly dubbed or speak with heavy accents.\r\n\r\nThe obvious CGI is unsurprisingly cartoonish, but the actual shark footage is good, filmed off the coast of South Africa. The main protagonists are decent and play it straight while the heavies are too over-the-top sinister. The few unintentional laughs don’t come until the final act.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"

Taking in torture, murder, violence on tap, and a wonderful mystery plot, it's not hard to see why the film has gained a massive reputation as the years have rolled by - where although it's brutish in substance, the film is a damn riveting piece of work.\r\n\r\nRalp Meeker is excellent as Hammer, a character who refuses to lay down, he gets knocked down constantly, but he gets back up tougher than before, he becomes the kind of hard boiled guy who hits first and then asks questions later. The direction from Robert Aldrich is perfect, off-kilter camera work drags the viewer into this skew-whiff world that Hammer has entered, and we often only see shots of the bad guys torsos so as to make them faceless thugs. It's down right aggressive film making that hits the requisite thriller mark.\r\n\r\nKiss Me Deadly has influenced many others since its release, be it \"Repo Man\" or \"Pulp Fiction\", the impact is still being felt today. Containing a much talked about ending (both the restored and alternate endings work on differing levels to many), it's a film that leaves things up for discussion and debate, but what we do know for sure is that it's explosive and crowns what is now firmly established as a crime classic from the film noir splinter of film making styles. 8.5/10"

This film depicts one such gentleman - a well meaning Father who struggles to find fulfilment at home in Scotland. His seminarian friend Edmund Gwenn is now the Bishop, and decides he needs a challenge - so he is duly dispatched to China where he is tasked with spreading his faith amongst those in a war-torn province coming to terms with the end of the Ming dynasty and the ascension of the new Republic. Oscar nominated Gregory Peck brings quite a bit of nuance to his role. He arrives to find his mission in ruins and a congregation he could count on one hand. His sense of humanity and his determination to help the poor, sick, and needy attracts the attention of the local mandarin, whose son he helps recover from a life-threatening illness. In return, he is provided with land and builders; builds a new mission and even manages to secure the services of three nuns - the senior of whom he has a bit of a contretemps with before war presents them all with more important issues to deal with... The story is told by way of a retrospective, so we know all along roughly what happens in the end - but Peck along with a solid supporting cast including Thomas Mitchell and Rosa Stradner keep this creatively photographed story engaging for an, admittedly, long 2¼ hours. Keep an eye out for a few short scenes from Vincent Price and a very young Roddy McDowell (just 16) too."

I'm assuming it was made as a precursor of - and to capitalise upon - the far superior \"Zulu\" (1964) but right from the get-go it's just wordy and ponderous and, well, lacklustre. Peter O'Toole does exude a certain arrogance in his role as the Commander of the army (Lord Chelmsford) but Burt Lancaster - and his distinctly ropey accent - as \"Col. Durnford\", features all too sparingly to offer much more than a casual dig at the incompetencies of his boss as the Zulu and the soldiers of the Queen square up. This cast list is impressive but none of the assembled stars of stage and screen are really used to any great effect. History tells us what happens next, and the colourful action scenes are well put together with enthusiastic efforts from the Zulu themselves delivering well staged combat scenes. Sadly, though, we have to wait far too long for these to rescue this from the doldrums of colourful but procedural cinema that offers us little to nourish either our interest in the characters or in the colonial and ambitious politics of the region that prevailed at the time. Underwhelming, sorry!"

I don't know what the connection is to the Mormons but it does not detract from the movie.  I don't think the word Mormon is heard in the movie, and the church they visit could be any modern church.  Having religious characters does help the characters stay true to their Austen-era values.  Most of the fun of any P&P adaptation is seeing the characters and I think they are all very consistent to the characters in the book as far as their motivations and personalities.  The biggest disappointment is the lack of a Mr. & Mrs. Bennett but they were probably trying to stay in budget.  The character Lady Catherine is also missing with Caroline Bingley taking over some of that plot drama.  Overall, I can recommend this movie to fans of the book. I prefer the Keira Knightly version but this one is fun too."

Fisk senior has withdrawn from life and as a part of his son trying to keep him involved in society, they visit a talk on reincarnation where they briefly meet local clergyman, Dean Spanley.  Following a further chance meeting, Fisk junior decides that he would like to spend more time with the reclusive Spanley, but he can only do so if he can procure a bottle of Imperial Tokaji (formerly spelled Tokay in English).  \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, the acting in this film is superb by all, Northam with his quiet frustration with his father as Fisk junior and Brown does his “abrasive” Australian.  But it is Sam Neil and Peter O'Toole who are the highlights – their acting, particularly during close ups, is at times incredible.  \r\n\r\nFull credit to Toa Fraser for bringing these performances out with his light-handed direction.  \r\n\r\nThe beginning of the film can be a bit slow but I believe that this was done on purpose as a reflection of Fisk senior's life...as we journey with him, the film opens up more.  \r\n\r\nI highly recommend this film, especially if you can try some Tokaji when you watch it.  \r\n\r\n9/10."

Lee Thompson and adapted for the screen by Carl Foreman from a novel of the same name written by Henry Wilson Allen (AKA: Heck Allen, Henry Allen & Will Henry!), which in turn is loosely based on the legend of the Lost Adams Diggings. It stars Gregory Peck, Omar Sharif, Camilla Sparv, Julie Newmar, Ted Cassidy & Telly Savalas. It's photographed by Joseph MacDonald in Technicolor and Super Panavision, with a music score by Quincy Jones. \r\n\r\nIt begins so well, the credits inform us that not only do we get Peck, Sharif and Newmar in lead roles, but that we also have in support a role call of quality thespians: Eli Wallach, Edward G. Robinson, Raymond Massey, Burgess Meredith, Lee J. Cobb, Keenan Wynn & Anthony Quayle. We are then treated to some gorgeous aerial photography of Monument Valley, a Vulture glides gracefully thru the air, and then, we hear the awful strains of \"Old Turkey Buzzard\" warbled like it belongs in a seventies porn movie by José Feliciano. It's there that the true marker for Mackenna's Gold is set. \r\n\r\nThe idea and source for the plot is safe, Lawman Mackenna (Peck) has the knowledge of where the legendary Canyon of Gold is. A fabled place awash with gold but guarded religiously by the Apache. With the map safely tucked away in his brain, Peck is quickly captured by blood thirsty Mexican bandit, Colorado (Sharif), and his companions, one of which (Newmar playing Indian Hesh-Ke) has past history with Mackenna. But that's not all, pretty soon Mackenna's party are joined by a whole host of other gold seekers, all seemingly gripped with Gold Fever. So in fighting and suspicion ensues, and with the Cavalry in pursuit of Colorado and the Apache still to come, this is as dangerous as it gets. If only the film wasn't so choppy and flat. \r\n\r\nThe film was originally a three hour epic, complete with intermission, but the budget probably all went on securing the cast and the producers don't seem able to deal with the task of making a big budget epic. Thus the film was cut to just over two hours; thank god for small mercies! Looking at the cast assembled it's obvious that this was a very ambitious project meant to keep the Western flag flying high and enthral the adventure seeking cinema goer. And you can see why such a quality cast signed on for the film, tho Peck was second choice after Clint Eastwood wisely chose to make Hang Em High instead. But what plays out is a series of clichés and absurdities that makes one unintentionally laugh. The effects are awful, I mean OK we don't expect back screen work to be high class, but here, with the actors half heartedly pretending it's real, it belies the fine work of MacDonald for the exteriors. \r\n\r\nThe problems don't just stop with the effects, before we even get to the issues in the cast, there's Jones' dreadful score to try and ignore. It sounds like he thinks he's scoring a Keystone Cops Gold Rush type movie! Dimitri Tiomkin, along with Foreman, is on production duties (hmm), I'm sure he could have knocked up something better for this film in his sleep. Peck is actually OK, with that laconic way of his, he suits the tone of the narrative. Sharif is grossly miscast, while Sparv is simply woeful. Newmar raises the temperatures of audience and cast alike, which you sense was her only instruction, while the lauded support cast file in and out without time to impact on proceedings. All of which leads to a finale of ham, model work and predictability. Yet there's been just enough to make the undemanding stay to the end. We wonder if indeed there is a Canyon of Gold, and Peck is so likable we just want to see him win out and defy the baddies. \r\n\r\nDoes it succeed by failing big? Well it is fun, but coming as it does from the makers of the Guns of Navarone, you have to believe that the end product is not the sort of entertainment they originally set out to craft. 3.5/10"

        "content": "***Entertaining, but comic booky 1969 Western with a superlative cast***  \r\n\r\n\"MacKenna's Gold\" (1969) deals with the insanity of ‘gold fever’ and builds-up a good amount of anticipation concerning the secret gold canyon. Does it exist or doesn’t it? Western expert Brian Garfield (author of \"Death Wish\") commented on \"MacKenna's Gold\" in his outstanding book \"Western Films\" thusly: \"it hasn't a single redeeming quality. It has got to be the most expensive star-studded two-hour ‘B’ movie ever made; a gargantuan dud of absolutely stunning dreadfulness.\"\r\n\r\nIt hasn't a SINGLE redeeming quality? Okay, let me list a smattering: Outstanding cast, including Gregory Peck, Omar Sharif, Ted Cassidy, Julie Newmar, Telly Savalas, Carmilla Sparv and many more, albeit mostly cameos; one of the greatest Western scores of all time by Quincy Jones, which ranks up there with \"How the West Was Won,\" \"Rio Lobo,\" \"Duel at Diablo,\" \"Bandolero!\" \"Bonanza,\" \"The Magnificent Seven\" and \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (to name a handful); a standout theme song, \"Old Turkey Buzzard,\" sung by Jose Feliciano, written by Jones; and magnificent locations (Utah, Arizona, Rogue River Oregon) & cinematography.\r\n\r\nPlus, although the story has an undeniable comic booky vibe (which explains why Garfield referred to it as a \"B\" movie), it is played out in a completely serious manner. And pretty much holds your attention while creating much anticipation regarding the legendary canyon.\r\n\r\nGregory Peck, who plays Marshal MacKenna, and Carmilla Sparv are definitely the \"good guys.\" The film was made at a time (the late 60s) when characters in Westerns tended to be unlikable or amoral (e.g. \"The Wild Bunch,\" \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" and \"Macho Callahan\"), and this movie has its fill as well, but it's nice to have some quality protagonists.\r\n\r\nOmar Sharif plays the head Mexican bandit \"Colorado\" excellently. It's sort of an atypical role for him, but he performs with such gusto it seems he was born to play the part. Ted Cassidy, well-known as \"Lurch\" on TV's The Addam's Family, plays the intimidating, laconic Indian warrior Hachita. He superbly fits the character (regardless of whether or not he has AmerIndian blood running through his veins). Julie Newmar is likewise great as a CRAZY squaw. Red-blooded males will be interested to know that she has a nude swimming scene.\r\n\r\nQuincy Jones' opening score and the theme song \"Old Turkey Buzzard\" are so stirring (especially combined with the magnificent Southwest photography) that sometimes I'll just play the beginning of the film, which runs a full 6-8 minutes (!). I've heard some complain that \"Old Turkey Buzzard\" is corny. But, speaking as someone who’s never been much of a fan of County/Western music, \"Old Turkey Buzzard\" is just a potent composition, regardless of the musical genre. It effectively comments on man's temporal nature and the insane & contagious condition of gold fever.\r\n\r\nWhile \"MacKenna's Gold\" certainly lacks the gritty realism of, say, the contemporaneous \"The Wild Bunch,\" it is indeed a serious film despite some undeniable cartoonish aspects. One could also probably nitpick about the not-quite-successful F/X miniature sequences, but that's not important; what is important is the film's entertainment value. At the end of the day \"MacKenna's Gold\" entertains.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 8 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

Westlake from the novel of the same name written by Jim Thompson. It stars Anjelica Huston, John Cusack and Annette Bening. Music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Oliver Stapleton.\r\n\r\n“The best reason I can think of is that you scare the hell out of me. I have seen women like you before, baby. You're double-tough and you are sharp as a razor, and you get what you want or else; but you don't make it work forever. Sooner or later the lightning hits, and I'm not gonna be around when it hits you”\r\n\r\n1990 was a grand year for neo-noir, of the dozen + titles that came out that year, The Grifters sits atop of the pile. A superlative film noir that boasts class on the page and on both sides of the camera. Set in modern day Los Angeles, the story follows three cynical and sly con artists through a psychological fog of bluff, double bluff, pain, misery, manipulations and shattering developments. That the trio consists of a boyfriend, girlfriend and an estranged mother only darkens the seamy waters still further.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles positively bristles with a smouldering atmosphere thanks to the work of Frears, Bernstein and Stapleton. Sexual tension is ripe, Westlake’s adaptation doing justice to Thompson’s novel, while the three leads – and Pat Hingle in super support – are on fire, bringing complex characters vividly to life as they trawl through the devilishly labyrinthine plot, adding biting humour and shallow savagery into the bargain.\r\n\r\nA top draw neo-noir that doesn’t cut corners or pull its punches, from the split screen opening salvo to the pitch black finale, The Grifters delivers high quality for neo-noir fans. 9/10"

It's a decent film, lovely to look at with its scope photography and technicolor palettes, James Garner and Edmond O'Brien are holding court in the acting stakes, and of course this being a submarine war film it has the requisite claustrophobic feel. Yet it never really gels as a whole, submerging too far into the mundane to play out a whole bunch of sequences that test the patience of the viewer. There's also the not too small problem of being able to suspend disbelief with the final mission.\r\n\r\nNow this is Hollywood and a Warner Brothers film, in 1959, so we don't naturally expect realism in our story telling, in fact we often want incredulity to stir the blood, but this kinda takes the rise too far. Alan Hale Junior is on hand for comic relief, and this proves good foil for Garner's lovable charm, but Gordon Douglas directs at such a snails pace you get the feeling that the comedy is just a merciful release for all involved. In short there's both the good and bad of 1950s war film making on show here; production value is high - narrative thrust is tepid. 6/10"

        "content": "As a kid, I always loved submarine films. As a weapon of war, they aways provided a great vehicle for an adventure - great atmosphere, murky depths and torpedos that seemed very rarely to hit what they were aimed at! Best of all, though, there was positively no room at sea, on the boat, for any slushy romance!! This film opens with James Garner (\"Braden\") doing his best impression of the beach scene in \"From Here to Eternity\" (1953) with Andra Martin (\"Sally\") and my heart sank - yuk, I thought! Yet, no - stick with it. Shortly after all this sand in the swimsuit malarkey and a marriage proposal after knowing each other for a fortnight, he is shipped out to Pearl Harbour and is soon at sea engaged on a perilous top secret mission to photograph some Japanese radio codes. Edmond O'Brien is his captain - the men don't initially hit it off, and Alan Hale Jr (\"Malone\") is the generally jovial Irish man in the middle trying to keep the peace, and the pace starts to pick up nicely. Garner was better with more comedic roles; he's probably nobody's idea of an hero but he does OK with this. The tension with O\"Brien is just too forced, though - we know all along what's going to happen, so why create this extra layer of animosity? Once it's underway (so to speak) it has a fair degree of action and the denouement provides for quite an exciting display of pyrotechnics. Not the best of this genre by a long chalk, but forget the first twenty minutes and it's well worth a watch."

        "content": "Poison Ivy: The Secret Society is the “sexy girl version of The Skulls” (Wikipedia), but I think it’s more like the 'dumb blonde version.' I'm not saying that the protagonist's intellectual ineptitude is directly related to her gender or hair color; her golden mane and femininity are just an unfortunate coincidence. \r\n\r\nDanielle Brooks (Miriam McDonald) is a farm girl — completing the trifecta of stereotypes — who transfers to Berkshire College, an elite New England private school. Danielle sold the property she inherited from her late parents to pay for school, and yet the best she can afford is a work-study program. Oh, and her nickname is Daisy. How do I know all this? It’s all in the \"Berkshire Transfer Students Official List,\" (BTSOL, if you’re into the whole brevity thing) of which we even see a copy. I swear, they could show a character literally reading directly off the script, and it wouldn’t be as dumb as this. \r\n\r\nDaisy, by the way, is the name of a flower, as is Azalea (Shawna Waldron), who is the president of the Ivys, a \"secret\" society that everyone on campus knows about; on the other hand, it must be impossible to keep a secret in a college so small that, as far as we can see, only offers one single, solitary course, attended by all the main characters, and taught by Professor Andrew Graves (Greg Evigan), who is not only married to the dean (Catherine Hicks), but is also the father of Daisy's romantic interest, Blake (Ryan Kennedy).\r\n\r\nAzalea learns that Daisy is a shoo-in to get a coveted internship; the former’s plan to prevent this from happening is to get Daisy to join the so-called secret society. “Turning the farm girl into an Ivy won't stop her from getting the internship,” Blake warns her; Azalea's response is \"yeah, we'll see about that\". Spoiler alert: we never see about that. \r\n\r\nWhat we do see is the Ivy’s vast influence (one can't help but wonder why Azalea doesn't just use this leverage to nab the internship for herself). Once Daisy is accepted, she doesn't have to worry about money anymore; “Who do you think made your financial aid problems go away? Who do you think gave you your scholarship?” Azalea asks rhetorically. To my chagrin, though, she doesn't ask who makes Steve Guttenberg a star.\r\n\r\nDo the writers (unbelievably, it took three people to write this movie) really expect us to believe that, on top of selling the family ranch or whatever, Daisy still needs not only a student loan but also a scholarship, or do they just not understand the difference between the two? \r\n\r\nI lean towards option B, especially after seeing the way Azalea blackmails Daisy, which involves Will (Brendan Penny), Daisy’s rancher boyfriend whom she left behind (“how do you know about Will,” Daisy asks; my guess is she must have read it on BTSOL). \r\n\r\nAzalea claims to \"have this piece of paper and at the top it says \"title deed\", at the bottom, a name and it's \"William Miller\".\" Daisy never even demands to see this document, so she may just be dumb enough to believe that \"Will's land\" really \"is at stake,\" as Azalea later assures her; moreover, recording Azalea's confession and immediately playing the tape back to her is likewise not the action of a person of at least adequate intelligence."

A remake of Craven’s 1972 film of the same name (itself influenced by Ingmar Bergman’s The Virgin Spring), it stars Tony Goldwyn, Monica Potter, Garret Dillahunt, Sara Paxton, Spencer Treat Clark and Martha MacIsaac. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Sharone Meir.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDuring a family vacation, teenagers Mari (Paxton) and Paige (MacIsaac) are viciously set about by a gang led by recent prison escapee Krug (Dillahunt). When bad weather forces Krug’s car to career off the road, the gang, unbeknownst to them, seek refuge in the vacation home of Mari’s parents. When the parents realise what their new lodgers have done, they begin to enact bloody retribution.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt’s pointless going on about remakes of old horror films, they are here to stay and we continue to watch them in the hope that they will strike a chord with us. With The Last House on the Left, remaking it, to me at least, is understandable given the 72 film is not exactly a great classic itself. True enough to say it has that grainy grunginess that was so befitting the decade’s horror movies, marking it out as an unsettling experience without really living up to its “terrifying” reputation. In fact if you put both movies together they still wouldn’t have enough class in them to give Bergman’s movie a run for its money.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo the remake then, all glossy and big budgeted, with name actors in the principal roles, it is by definition routinely packaged for the modern day audience. However, that doesn’t take away from the fact that what unfolds on that screen is challenging us, it really does do its job. The pertinent question exists, are you capable of such violence having had violence inflicted on your loved ones previously? What would you do in the same situation that Mari’s parents find themselves in?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe have been privy to what was meted out to poor Mari and Paige, and the impact is most distressing. There is good cause to argue that Iliadis and his production team go too far in grabbing our attention in readiness for the “revenge” factor later on. Certainly I myself was uncomfortable watching it, as I was with the I Spit on Your Grave remake, but it’s about getting a prescribed response, however close to the knuckle it is.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt’s not a film anyone can feel comfortable about recommending, surely? But I know it put me through a gamut of emotions, even making me feel bad about myself the next day. That is quite often the power of cinema, and clearly the banner that Craven and Iliadis held aloft during the publicity tours for The Last House on the Left. Today I give the film an uneasy 7/10, it’s uncompromising and unapologetically violent, but also laced with flaws. On another day I may find myself rating it considerably lower…"

Despite the attractive females and exotic dancer angle, the movie thankfully avoids raunchiness and delivers a good message. \r\n\r\nMy two favorite females in the cast are Katheryn Winnick as Olga and the curvy brunette who plays with Gabrielle Reece. The other volleyball girls include: Marnette Patterson (Crystal), Patricia De Leon (Corazon) and Kenya Moore (Champagne).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes, and was shot in Malibu, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

After something bad happens in an Arizona town he offers to escort a dance hall woman (Maureen O’Hara) to a ghost town where her former beau was buried. There are a couple problems though: They have to go through Apache territory and two lowlifes accompany them most of the way.\r\n\r\nReleased in 1961, “The Deadly Companions” has a lot going for it: It stars Keith and the beautiful O'Hara, who had such great chemistry in \"The Parent Trap,” released the very same month. This is Sam Peckinpah's directorial debut in cinema. Most people reading this know that Peckinpah went on to become a highly acclaimed director with notable efforts like \"Ride the High Country\" (1962). In addition, \"The Deadly Companions\" was filmed on location in Arizona (including Old Tucson); you can't beat Arizona for fine, authentic Western locations. Lastly, the picture only runs 90 minutes, so it won't likely wear out its welcome.\r\n\r\nThe first act is promising, highlighted by a church service in a saloon with O'Hara playing a social outcast amongst the church folk (for legitimate reasons). After a tragedy happens, the tone turns melancholic as the characters take a hard journey through the desert where they fight with each other and the Injuns. The movie’s realistic and harsh, reminiscent of unmemorable Westerns like “The Appaloosa” (1966) and “The Stalking Moon” (1968). “Molly and Lawless John” (1972) was the only one that took this basic approach and made a compelling Western. \r\n\r\nBut at least Peckinpah & team tried to do something different, like Brando did with the contemporaneous “One-Eyed Jacks.” The odd classical-meets-Country-and-Western score by Marlin Skiles is notable. At the end of the day “The Deadly Companions” shoots for dark art with a message of maybe redemption but, after the quality first act, never rises above mediocre. And verges on “The Deadly Dull.” \r\n\r\nI kind of liked it, though, but you have to be in a meditative, brooding mood.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"

A big reason for my positive rating is the aforementioned Washington, who gives as good a performance as he always tends to give - which is why he is probably my favourite actor, him or Leonardo DiCaprio anyway.\r\n\r\nJohn Travolta does well though, even if I kept getting <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/face-off/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Face/Off</a>'</em> vibes throughout.

The first film, even with all the flaws, was quite good and was so enjoyable that it became a milestone for many people's childhood and adolescence. The second film managed to retain many of the first's qualities, but lacked a credible and intelligent script. This film, in turn, is not able to learn from the mistakes of its predecessor and ends up sounding like more of the same, in a tired and worn recipe.\r\n\r\nThe action of the film takes place several years after the second and first. If for Jesse time passed, for Willy time would pass even faster, since these animals usually have an average lifespan of twenty to twenty-five years in human age. So, if Willy would still be young in the first film, in this film he would be a much more mature animal, and the probability of being able to answer his old partner's call of circus skills would be, to say the least, a house-sized absurdity.\r\n\r\nEven so, the script brings the two together again, and this time to face an illegal whaling ship willing to hunt as many orcas as it can, to make good money with them. Keeping what we've been used to since the beginning, the film seeks to raise public awareness of important issues for the preservation of marine life, and this time nothing seems better than showing the cruelty of illegal hunting of whales and other cetaceans. However, the weakness of the film itself somewhat undermines such noble intentions, and I have no doubt that the Chinese would abhor the idea, given that China is one of the rare countries that still sanctions the hunting of these animals.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that the film has lost all the freshness and shine of the first two, and that we also do not have a quality direction that knows how to squeeze the few qualities that still remain in the franchise. And although the villains are quite impressive, the film is predictable, all the material is tired and does not hold our attention. The film is saved, “in extremis”, by the fast pace and by the fact that it doesn't take long to finish.\r\n\r\nBack to the usual characters, Jason James Ritcher and August Schellenberg return to be present, but if Ritcher still manages reasonably with the task, Schellenberg seems a shadow of what he was in the previous films, even if it is a return that is more than positive and well-received. coming. With the rest of the previous cast declining the chance of returning, we are left with the positive and interesting addition of Patrick Kalpatrick, who offers us a very satisfactory job. Vincent Berry also deserves a good grade, but there's not much for him to do, really.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film continues to bet on good cinematography and the choice of beautiful filming locations. As with its predecessor, it's a film that doesn't look its age: if you watch it without knowing when it was made, you don't give it more than ten years. Good sound effects, good special effects and a realistic animatronic whale are some of the values that the film presents to us. The soundtrack is pleasant, but it's a recycling of previous material."

For instance, in “Wild in the Country” (1961) he’s a troubled rural youth on probation, in “Blue Hawaii” (1961) he’s a tour guide, in “Kid Galahad” (1962) he’s a boxer, in “Viva Las Vegas” (1964) he’s a race car driver and in “Roustabout” (1964) he’s a carnival worker. \r\n \r\nThis one was the blueprint for all of those and works well because it’s basically a retelling of Elvis’ own rags-to-riches story and so he’s comfortable playing a rising music star with the challenges thereof.\r\n\r\nEverything works except the melodramatic last act, which somewhat lost my interest. Plus the girlfriend (Dolores Hart) is deemphasized and so her relationship with the Presley character isn’t compelling. On the positive side, when he’s frolicking on the farm with her and feeding a horse a sugar cube and singing, there’s a wholesomeness and innocence to treasure. Plus Elvis never looked better, being young and lean.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood and the Ivar Theatre.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

He portrays a lawyer who falls in love with and impulsively marries Carole Lombard (\"Jane\") and they have a baby. Simultaneously, his job prospects take a turn for the worst and they find themselves a bit skint. This puts obvious pressures on their relationship and the film charts their ups and downs. Charles Coburn turns in a good performance as the \"Judge\" and there's quite a tense sequence with Ward Bond/Eddie Quillan flying in to the rescue at the end. I think sometimes we tend to forget that a lot of these films were little more than production-line efforts; so maybe we expect too much by way of distinctive storylines and/or performances. This one is fine, but forgettable."

Morton's performance is actually quite good; and her life of drugs, sex and lack of fulfilment may well have been the depiction of a labour of love from director Lynne Ramsey and co-author Liana Dognini, but as a piece of engaging cinema it fails completely. I don't doubt that there are many people for whom this is a manifestation of their psychological difficulties - an inability to form any kind of meaningful relationship - on any level - with anyone else; but it is presented in such a drab, pedestrian fashion that even some grand cinematography of the Balearic scenery does little to lift it from the doldrums."

Gazzo from the novel A Stone for Danny Fisher written by Harold Robbins. It stars Elvis Presley, Carolyn Jones, Walter Matthau, Dolores Hart, Dean Jagger, Vic Morrow, Paul Stewart and Jan Shepard. Music is scored by Walter Scharf and cinematography by Russell Harlan. Plot finds Presley as Danny Fisher, a high school student struggling at school who falls in with the wrong crowd just as family matters of the heart start to take a hold.\r\n\r\nHe said anybody that disagreed with you got a punch in the mouth. Is that what I brought you up to do, to fight?\r\n\r\nThe last film Presley made before going off to do his service in the army, King Creole is his best film. It's one of only a small handful that showed the star actually had some acting ability, here he gets a top director to work under and a very tidy cast put along side him for him to respond too. Presley immediately warmed to Curtiz (Casablanca/Mildred Pierce), wilfully doing as he was told by the wily old director, rewarding the film fan with a performance of some merit. Presley would often say it was his personal favourite of his own films, and it's not hard to see why. Though packed with musical numbers, many of them belters as well, the film always stays dramatic, in fact the tunes form part of the narrative, they are not frothy interludes slotted in purely for fan appeasement.\r\n\r\nEverything he touches turns to drink.\r\n\r\nIt's not unreasonable to expect King Creole to be a fun movie, the kind where Elvis flies a plane, speeds around on power boats, or saves the word during a treasure hunt, because the poster art and DVD covers lend you to think that. Honestly, one shows the King with guitar wrapped around him, hips bent and a huge smile on his face, the other has the same Elvis pose but along side him is a smiling beauty bedecked in a banana patterned dress! I mean really, would you think this film is shot in moody black and white, features murders, theft, family upheaval, drunks, knife fights, wasted life and all round dirty tricks? That the King is snarly, aggressive and channelling Jim Stark from Rebel Without a Cause? Because all these things reside within this potent and most agreeable Elvis picture.\r\n\r\nNow you know. That's how you get into it.\r\n\r\nWith the drama relocated from the New York of the novel to Bourbon Street New Orleans, and Danny Fisher changed from a boxer to a singer, atmosphere needed to be tight to the emotionally battered story. And it is, very much so, with Harlan (Ramrod/Riot in Cell Block 11) doing a great job of making The Big Easy come off as The Big Seedy. This is a world of back alleys where hoodlum youths dwell and of wet tinged streets barely lit by gas lamps, many of the night scenes shot here are worthy of film noir status, with a rain sodden mugging sequence truly top of the line. Conversely Curtiz also paints a bustling Orleans picture, with song clubs and street sellers proving to be the heartbeat of the city. It's a twin viewpoint of Orleans that matches other duality themes that drive the narrative forward, because Danny is caught between two girls and two night club owners.\r\n\r\nCast are very good across the board, with Matthau menacing, Morrow weasel like, Jagger and Jones sad and pitiful, Stewart elegantly honest and Hart doing a neat line in confused love. Stand out tunes include the title song, \"Hard Headed Woman\", \"Trouble\", \"Steadfast Loyal and True\", \"Lover Doll\" and the quite beautiful \"As Long As I Have You\". It's not perfect, serious crime goes unpunished, the main motive driving on Matthau's club boss is rather weak and the two love interest girls are written lazily as love sick puppies. Yet this is still a cracker of a movie, where Presley bristles with magnetism and emotional conflict and Curtiz and Harlan rack up the requisite amount of impressive atmospheric visuals. 8/10"

Despite the name, don’t expect any bayous; the story takes place entirely in and around the Bourbon St. district of New Orleans. \r\n\r\nTouted as one of the best Presley flicks because it’s a relatively dark & serious Big Easy drama meshed with a few of his musical performances, it’s not as compelling or believable as Elvis’ better dramas, like \"Kid Galahad\" (1962) or “Roustabout” (1964) nor as entertaining as his more farcical movies, like “Viva Las Vegas\" (1964).\r\n\r\nThe story, which came from a book by Harold Robbins, feels contrived. You have rival club owners (one good/one bad, of course) with a “sing for me or else” element and an eye-rolling subplot involving Danny’s father, a pharmacy, back alley toughs and black mail. The B&W photography doesn’t help.

His boyish charms and his moves delight the audience, and they also attract the mischievous temptress \"Ronnie\" (Carolyn Jones) - who just happens to be the mistress of the club's dodgy owner \"Maxie\" (Walter Matthau).

She is a good natured girl who tries to get \"Danny\" to see past his short term life and look to a more honest, positive future. Will his new friends allows either of them that luxury? Easily the best film Presley ever made, in my book. Curtis creates a wonderfully grim and gritty environment for this story of love, lust, greed and ambition to play out. The star himself was a bit old for his role, but still he looks every inch the wayward teen - a sort of mini-Marlon Brando; and the songs - though not his best or most memorable, are worked well into the narrative. Nope, the ending is never in doubt, but there is bags of charisma on offer here from a star who was exactly that."

Sadly I can't say that One-Eyed Jacks has left me anything other than frustrated and cold with disappointment.\r\n\r\nMarlon Brando took over directing duties from Stanley Kubrick after the two giants fell out about the direction the picture was taking, this let Brando loose to shoot for 6 months on a film meant to be wrapped in two. Now this may be the main problem to me because the film is painfully devoid of major fleshing out of the characters, scenes are not expanded and there are obvious gaps due to mass editing cuts. It reads on the screen that our protagonist gets sentenced to 5 years in jail, two seconds later we see a bearded haggard man escaping prison chained to another inmate, next shot he is clean shaved and it seems we have missed some important chat between the two escapists. On it goes throughout the picture, I'm sure that the final elongated cut (rumoured to be between 4 & 6 hours) would have been a joyous experience, but as it is we get a cut down 141 minutes of film that rather outstays it's welcome. And to get through it you really need to believe in patience being a virtue.\r\n\r\nBrando of course holds court and is never less than interesting, and at times he sizzles and dominates the screen in the way that Marlon was want to do. But the whole performance has the reek of over indulgence about it. Making it more about the actor than the actual narrative. Along side him, Karl Malden is solid and gruff as the villain of the piece, but Katy Jurado is badly underused and seems like an afterthought to be an important character. Sadly, too, Pina Pellicer struggles to convince in her only American film, but naturally that is not important in the context that she was to take her own life at the woefully young age of 29 (depending on what site you believe as regards age at death). The bright spot here is the cinematography from Charles Lang Jr at the various sites in California, it is simply gorgeous, check out the coastline shots and take it all in. I personally feel that this film is one that Brando fans choose to ignore the major flaws with. His name some how making the end product seem better than it actually is. In its longest form I'm sure it \"could have been a contender\" in the great Western stakes, as it is it remains average and something of an unfulfilling disappointment. 5/10"

Rio escapes 5 years later with only vengeance in mind. He finds Dad in Monterey, California, now a respectable town Sheriff with a Mexican wife (Katy Jurado) and step-daughter, Louisa (Pina Pellicer), living the American Dream on the beautiful Pacific coast. The situation is complicated by Rio's teaming up with two lowlife criminals whose only intent is to rob the town bank (Ben Johnson and Sam Gilman), as well as Rio's romantic dallyings with Louisa. \r\n\r\n\"One-Eyed Jacks\" was Brando's only stab at directing and his original cut of the film was twice as long (!). I would love to see this director's cut, which HAS been shown on TV, but this 141-minute cut is fine as is. \r\n\r\nNot only is \"One-Eyed Jacks\" one of the best Westerns of all time, it's also one of Brando's top films. What makes it so great? Several things. Brando is at his most captivating here, but the story is entrancing as well, even though it's more of a slow drama Western than an action/adventure. When the action comes, however, it's quick and realistic.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous themes running through the long story. One of the major ones is the clash of the misfit with conventional society. Since society is composed of a bunch of conformist misfits, the misfit must learn to conform if s/he wants to fit in and succeed. In other words, if you want to 'make it' in conventional society it's necessary to hide your problematic past & flaws and put on a front of respectability. Dad Longworth has figured this out and he's not about to allow Rio to ruin it for him.\r\n\r\nI would like to offer a word of defense for Dad Longworth: Although it was wrong for him to take the money and leave Rio to be captured, one can't help but empathize with him. If he went back for Rio there was a high risk of capture or death. The safest and most promising route was the selfish one. The good thing is that Dad wisely took advantage of this opportunity and made a good life for himself in Monterey. He was obviously sick of his criminal lifestyle and wanted a real life, a real job and real family. He was getting on in years and knew that this may well be his final opportunity, so he took it.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that one's past always has a way of haunting us or coming back to bite us in the hind end, which is another theme of the film; hence, Rio walks back into Dad's life 5 years later and his American dream is suddenly threatened. Notice Dad's rage when he whips/beats Rio to an inch of his life; he's doing everything in his power to kill the ugly phantoms of his past, which is why he tries to get Rio hung on false charges later in the story.\r\n\r\nAnother theme is how love is tied to redemption. Both Dad and Rio are criminals, but both desire redemption and a better life. The love of Dad's wife and the Monterey general populace brings this out in Dad, whereas Louisa's love for Rio slowly changes him. Near the end we plainly see that Rio no longer wants to kill anyone, he doesn't even want to see his nemesis; all he wants is to run off with his lady love. If Rio remained the same person he was at the beginning of the story \"One-Eyed Jacks\" wouldn't be half the film it is.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Dad's love for Katie, his Mexican wife, is what delivered Katie and Louisa \"from the beanfields,\" as Dad puts it.\r\n\r\nLove goes hand-in-hand with loyalty or faithfulness. We see this in Rio's likable Mexican sidekick, Chico (Larry Duran).\r\n\r\nOne of the best qualities of \"Jacks\" is that it's refreshingly realistic. There's no goofiness, unbelievable one-liners, over-the-top action or excruciatingly dated aspects, except for the opening credits & corresponding score. Thankfully, the rest of the film isn't.\r\n\r\n\"One-Eyed Jacks\" was the obvious precursor to the Spaghetti Western. For instance, the protagonist is a dyed-in-the-wool \"cool\" anti-hero (like, say, Eastwood). The main difference between \"Jacks\" and most Spaghetti Westerns, however, is that \"Jacks\" has a worthwhile story, which can't be said for most Italo-Westerns; also the anti-hero in \"One-Eyed Jacks\" slowly transforms into a potentially positive member of society.\r\n\r\nThe film's influence goes well beyond just the Spaghetti Westerns. Take, for instance, the crucifixion-style beating and long restoration. \"Conan the Barbarian\" (1982) pretty much ripped-off this entire sequence; Arnold Schwarzenegger even admitted to it.\r\n\r\nPina Pellicer does a notable job as Rio's girlfriend Louisa. Spiritually-speaking, she's incredible. Although she commits a foolish error after getting drunk, on a whole she's the epitome of love, virtue and spirituality. Again, this love is the key factor in someone's metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Pina committed suicide a few years after \"Jacks\" was released. Thankfully we have this film to remember her beauty and virtue.\r\n\r\n\"Jacks\" was filmed entirely in California with all the coastal sequences photographed on the Monterey Peninsula, including Pebble Beach. This is one of the few Westerns where you'll see the Pacific Ocean (you'll also see it at the beginning of 1954's \"Garden of Evil\"). Other locations include Big Sur and Death Valley.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A"

Back home now as an adult, after a stint in the army, he falls for a sharp-shooting carnival girl called Annie Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins) and promptly joins the act. But after a fall out with the boss, the pair hit the road and turn to a life of crime - with Annie particularly showing a thirst for gun-play.\r\n\r\nNo doubt inspired by real life outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, \"Deadly Is the Female\" (AKA: Gun Crazy) is as good a \"doomed lovers on the lam\" picture that has ever been made. It may be a \"B\" movie in terms of production, but no doubt about it, this film is stylish, crafty and also very sexy. Directed by the unsung Joseph H. Lewis (\"My Name Is Julia Ross/The Big Combo\"), it's based on a story written by MacKinlay Kantor that was reworked by Millard Kaufman (AKA: the then blacklisted \"Dalton Trumbo\"), into one that links sex and violence whilst simultaneously casting an eye over gun worship and its place in the American way of life. Dall & Cummings looked on the surface an odd pairing, but under Lewis' direction they go together like gun and holster (ahem). He is well spoken, almost elegantly fragile with his musings, yet underneath there is still this twitchy gun fanatic. She is savvy, almost virginal in sexuality, but ultimately she's a wild cat who's practically un-tamable.\r\n\r\nThe work of Lewis here should not be understated, check out the quite sublime continuous one take bank robbery. While marvel throughout at his long takes, use of angles, deep focus and jerking camera movements - all of which dovetail with our protagonists as they go on their nihilistic journey. But perhaps his master-stoke was with his preparation tactics for his two leads?. Sending them out with permission to improvise, he fired them up with sexual pep talks, and the result, in spite of the inevitable \"code\" restrictions, is a near masterpiece, a true genre highlight, and a film that continues to influence as much as it still entertains. 9/10"

When her friend \"Jane\" (Alison Steadman) wins an holiday on Mykonos for a fortnight, she invites \"Shirley\" to accompany her. She initially dithers but luckily a visit from her rather selfish daughter \"Millandra\" (Tracie Bennett) convinces her to head to the sunshine after all. Her pal doesn't even make it off the plane before she pulls, and so \"Shirley\" is left to her own devices. She quickly finds a replacement for her wall - a rock (not called Hudson) and it begins to look like she has merely substituted a beach for her kitchen at home, especially as the other British tourists who try to adopt her turn out to be twits of the highest order! Then she heads out for a stroll where she happens upon a small seaside bar where she meets the suave, moustachioed \"Costas\" (Tom Conti) and her adventure really begins. This is a very British film, this, I think. The nature of the humour is sarcastic and downbeat - and it is frequently laugh out loud and usually effective. The observational nature of the dialogue - often quite pithily delivered using her inanimate companions - is also enjoyable (and used effectively too by her lonely husband in his bomb-site of a kitchen). Miss Collins got an Oscar nomination for her performance here, and that was well deserved as I left the cinema wondering just how many real middle-aged people come to their senses in their mid-forties and realise that their lives have been lived vicariously and largely passed them by."

In the story it's supposed to the Catskills (or maybe the Adirondacks), but it's obvious that the film was shot out West. Regardless, the locations are exemplary.

Dick Sargent plays another guy smitten with the mysterious woman.   \r\n\r\n“Live a Little, Love a Little” (1968) was Elvis’ 28th movie and he would only do three more before leaving cinema for good. What distinguishes this one is the way it tries to make Elvis’ character more ‘hip’ with the swinging 60s. For example, his love interest propositions him to “make love” within mere minutes after meeting him. Thankfully, the woman offers a somewhat interesting character study for those interested. \r\n\r\nDespite her character’s nuttiness, Michele Carey is actually one of the most voluptuous women to star in an Elvis flick, along with Ann-Margret. There are also a few peripheral women just as beautiful, such as Celeste Yarnall, the woman in white at the groovy party that Greg kisses. Elvis and Celeste incidentally became good friends. They viewed the funeral of Martin Luther King Jr. together in his trailer over lunch. Celeste has stressed how warm & loving Elvis was and how he had an intense desire to please people.  \r\n\r\nElvis started to struggle with his weight around this time and had to take diet pills to keep slim; he wasn’t happy about doing musical fluff when he really wanted to do more serious stuff. While he could no longer demand his usual $1 million per movie, he did make $850,000 plus 50% of the profits on this one. Despite all this, Elvis looked bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. He certainly still had his charisma.     \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in Malibu, Marineland of the Pacific & Los Angeles, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

Much like other Anthony Mann pictures, The Far Country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery. Both of which play out amongst some of Mann's peccadilloes like honour, integrity, betrayal and of course, death!\r\n\r\nThe story sees fortune hunting partners Jeff Webster (James Stewart) and Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) travel to Oregon Territory with a herd of cattle. Aware of the blossoming gold-boom, they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a Klondike town. Arriving in Skagway they find self-appointed judge Mr. Gannon (John McIntire) ready to meet out justice to Webster on account of Webster having fractured the law, all be it with honest cause, along the way. In punishment Gannon takes the partners herd from them, but they steal them back and head across the Canadian border to Dawson - with Gannon and his men in hot pursuit. Here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involved.\r\n\r\nInteresting from start to finish, The Far Country benefits greatly from James Stewart's bubbling (anti) hero in waiting portrayal and Mann's slick direction of the tight Borden Chase script. The cinematography from William H. Daniels is superlative, though not done any favours by current DVD prints, and the film has a few surprises and a \"will he wont he?\" core that's reeling the viewers in. \r\n\r\nPaying dividends on re-watches for hardened genre fans, it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful, yet dark, Western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8/10"

Music is by Roberto Gerhard and cinematography by Denys Coop.\r\n\r\nFrank Machin (Harris) gets the opportunity to utilise his brute strength and angry nature out on the Rugby League field. It looks a match made in sporting heaven as Machin quickly establishes himself as a star in waiting, but off the field he is less successful at life's challenges...\r\n\r\nYou taking the jam out of someone's sandwich without asking for it?\r\n\r\nPigeon holed as Brit Kitchen Sink Drama or Brit New Wave, This Sporting Life is regardless a very unique and powerful film. It was director Anderson's first full length feature and also Harris' break out performance. What transpires over the course of the two hour plus running time, is a tale of mud, blood and emotionally fractured characters. Set to a grim back drop of a damp Yorkshire city, with coal mines and factories the means of employment, the streets are paved with stone and the terraced houses charred by the soot of the chimney smoke.\r\n\r\nJust a big ape on the football field.\r\n\r\nThis back drop marries up perfectly with Machin's life, where even out on the pitch he comes to understand that he's in a vortex of unfulfillment. There are some bright spots dripped into proceedings, hope dangled like a golden carrot, especially with one beautiful sequence as Frank plays with Margaret's (Roberts) kids, but bleakness is never far away, the story demands that. Margaret is his landlady and object of his brutish desire, she's one of life's warriors but struggling to keep up the good fight. Widowed and still burned by her husband's death, her relationship with Frank is heart aching in its hopelessness. Has the polishing of a pair of boots ever been so sad as it is here?\r\n\r\nHarris is a revelation, a tour de force, feral yet anguished, all coiled up in one hulking frame. Roberts, likewise, is terrific, a measured and layered turn that helps to bring the best out of Harris. Around the central pair are a roll call of grand British actors aiding the quality of the production, while Anderson and his editor Peter Taylor use brilliant bold-cut transitions to let the flashback narrative work its magic. From the whack of an arm thundering into Machin's teeth at the beginning of the film, to his punching of a spider on the wall at the end, this is a 1960s British classic of some considerable worth. 9/10"

Burt Lancaster portrays his popular XO who ought, originally, to have had that command but has been passed over; and the film depicts the evolution of their taut and mistrusting relationship. Gable is on good form as his character treads a very thin line between reason and obsession and Lancaster works hard to keep himself and the crew under control. The direction is tense and the chemistry between these two men works really well. This is more than a post-war grandstanding picture; it does touch on the psychology of command and of grief, and is well worth an hour and a half of your time."

        "content": "The Edbrook Haunting.\r\n \r\n\r\nHaunted is directed by Lewis Gilbert, who co-adapts the screenplay with Bob Kellett and Timothy Prager from the novel written by James Herbert. It stars Aidan Quinn, Kate Beckinsale, Anthony Andrews, Alex Lowe, John Gielgud and Anna Massey. Music is by Debbie Wiseman and cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFollowing the accidental death of his twin sister when they were just kids, David Ash (Quinn) has grown up to be a parapsychologist determined to debunk the existence of ghosts. Receiving an invitation from the Mariell family to investigate supernatural activity at their family home, Edbrook House, David accepts and quickly finds his life flipped upside down…\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt’s from the old fashioned school of horror, a period piece of some worth, but not one for anyone looking to be scared out of their wits. Actually the novel by the late great James Herbert was becalmed when judged by his superb standards, so it really will help any potential first time viewer to go into this expecting a more ethereal chiller than anything else.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere’s an air of romanticism constantly hanging in the air, and with Gilbert nodding towards the likes of The Haunting for his scares and Don’t Look Now for the meditation on grief angle, it’s a film of mixed blessings. Also nice to see very good period design for the 1920s setting, while Roberts’ photography skilfully brings beauty to the English countryside and murkier tones for the inner workings of Edbrook House. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCast are fine, with Quinn and a perky Beckinsale creating good sensual chemistry, and Andrews and Lowe are suitably odd as the clearly off-kilter Mariell brothers. Massey, however, is not challenged by her role and Gilegud is only really filing in for an easy money cameo.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt gets away from itself a little in the final stretch, where it’s not helped by some shoddy effects work, but there’s good value to be had in the picture. With grief, guilt, redemption and incest bubbling away thematically, and the spectral visage of David’s dead sister haunting the edges of the frame, film never lacks for literate effort or a sense of unease. The book is much better, mind. 7/10"

This is a great story from Greek myth; it's got the whole gamut of adventure elements from which to pick - so how come Jonathan English has managed to squander such a rich vein and come up with this badly produced, shockingly scripted affair with special effects that were around in the days of \"Blake's 7\" on the television thirty years earlier? Tony Todd has a look of evil for his depiction of the permanently zonked King Deucalion but as for the the rest of the cast - including a tiny cameo from Rutger Hauer as his father \"Cyrnan\"; the acting is just plain risible. \"Curse the God... Slay the Beast\" offers us a far more exciting tagline than this delivers - and I am sorry to say that even on television late at night after two bottles of your favourite tipple, the most ardent fans of TH (or the also handsome Lex Shrapnel) are going to be looking for \"Downton Abbey\" repeats on a streamer somewhere."

Hughes. Montgomery also stars and is supported by Wanda Hendrix, Thomas Gomez, Fred Clark, Andrea King and Art Smith. Music is by Frank Skinner and cinematography by Russell Metty.\r\n​\r\nWWII Veteran Lucky Gagin (Montgomery) arrives in San Pablo during Fiesta time with the intention of blackmailing the man responsible for the death of his pal.​\r\n\r\n1947 was a super year for film noir as a film making style, it's also a year that still even today hides little nuggets awaiting evaluation by noir fans, Ride the Pink Horse is one such piece. It feels a bit daft to suggest it's under seen, given that Gomez was nominated for a best Supporting Actor Academy Award (deserved as well) and Montgomery had made waves this year with his gimmicky production of The Lady in the Lake, but it does scream out as being little known.​\r\n\r\nThe title is a curious starting point, it's a reference to the carousel run by Gomez's Pancho character, a title that doesn't exactly scream out that this is a feverish noir, but that is exactly what it is. This is very much a bedfellow for Carol Reed's superb Odd Man Out (also 1947), the air of fatalism hanging heavy throughout, a sort of other wordly vibe that hooks you in and holds you there yearning for the resolution of the tale.\r\n\r\nThe setting is most interesting, that of a small Mexican town during its annual Fiesta celebrations. Yet as the locals indulge in frivolity and joy, Gagin (and us the viewers) are thrust into a shadowy claustrophobic world. The principal characters are suspiciously drawn, not so much Gagin - who is tough and downbeat and has a clear goal to aim for - but those who line up to hopefully aid him in some way. For the first half of the pic the makers keep the cards close to their chest, it's a nice move that ensures rewards await as the story shifts into a higher gear.​\r\n\r\nPsychologically the piece is strong, led by Gagin who was already feeling alienated after the war effort, but now also finds himself in an environment doubly alien to him, an interesting juxtaposition cunning in its placement for character development. Many noir staples shine bright, the main villain with a handicap, potential femme fatale, the macguffin, carnival imagery (the key carousel - gigantic scary looking effigy) and on it goes. \r\n\r\nThe look is terrific as Metty (Ivy/Crashout/Touch of Evil) and Montgomery bring much shadow play, the dalliances of slatted shadows and wooden beam crossbars further emphasising the imprisonment of Gagin at this life juncture. Montgomery proves a deft hand at directing a potent scene, here his  piece de resistance is a violent assault shot through the carousel while it is in motion, it's the high point of technical noir work in a film that has a lot of such.\r\n\r\nVery well performed in amongst the moral ambiguity, Ride the Pink Horse is very much recommended to those interested in film noir. As a character piece with visual treats, and as a fascinating psychological study, this one score high. 8/10"

It’s unique enough to stand on its own and is arguably on par with “Heathers” and the overrated “Mean Girls,” but it’s not as good as “Carrie” or its excellent sequel, “The Rage: Carrie 2,” which was released the same year.\r\n\r\nMcGowan is great as the alluring biyatch while Gayheart looks too old for the part at 27 during shooting, not to mention nigh anorexic. Two years after the film’s release, Rebecca hit a Hispanic kid with her car in Los Angeles and killed him, which tripped up her career.\r\n\r\nIt’s decent, has a great soundtrack and is worthwhile if you favor the cast, but don’t expect the greatness of teen flicks like \"Clueless\" (1995) and \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" (1982).

It even looks like they lifted a character directly out of \"Alice in Wonderland\", and maybe there was a legal loophole they had , but it was really unnecessary.\r\n\r\nHonestly, most of the premise is a lot of nonsense, and I don't mean to dash dreams and lose the fancy of imaginative creation, but it's not even just fun.  They took one of the few popular free stories (King Arthur) that Disney hadn't monopolized (\"Sword in the Stone\" only covers Arthur as a child, and this is after Camelot was realized), and then added so much magical guff to it that it was hardly recognizable as a version of the original story.  This is not a \"King Arthur and his Knights\" story, it's a Kayley, and you don't know who that is because they made her up.\r\n\r\nEven Cary Elwes (Princess Bride: The Man in Black), by far the best actor /  character in the movie, seems to have impatient disdain for having to perform the role, and he's probably the 3rd most occurring character.\r\n\r\nA knight that Arthur never would have made a knight, that the audience doesn't know, traitors the crown (when Lancelot did it, it was impactful) and kills a knight, that the audience doesn't know or care about, so the main character is launch into adventure on a basis that the audience objectively doesn't care about, and that adventure is further preluded with a Griffon dropping Excaliber into a cursed wood (which would have normally been represented by Merlin and/or the Woad), and having some magic would be fine, but they basically rip off the \"Fire Swamp\" from \"Princess Bride\" and add in all these questionably real people with weapons for hands.\r\n\r\nEverything I just wrote sounds insane, and that's without the guide being blind or there being a 2-headed dragon that hates  itselves.\r\n\r\nI'm tired, and you should skip this unless you just have to see the train wreck."

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are two characters from “Hamlet”, by William Shakespeare, but it is difficult for anyone to remember them without being very knowledgeable about the literary work in question. They really barely matter to the action. Here, they are the main actors, and we are invited, in a way, to see things through their eyes. In theater, this is interesting. In the cinema, and for a general audience that doesn't know “Hamlet” so well, this doesn't seem like a good idea.\r\n\r\nGary Oldman and Tim Roth brought the main roles to life with great panache and value, and the film ends up not being an absolute waste of time thanks to these two magnificent and valuable actors, full of talent. There is a high dose of “nonsense” in the dialogues between the two, and this can become tiring, but it generally works without surprising. The rest of the cast does not have such good material and opportunities to stand out, thus leaving the film somewhat devoid of good characters other than the protagonists.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the emphasis is on the costumes and sets. I can't say that there is great historical rigor here: historically, Hamlet's life is located in Denmark in the Year One Thousand and what we see is Renaissance, much more suited to people and figures who would be contemporary with Shakespeare. But I didn't have any problems with that, and that's not even a problem because all of this is fiction and can be situated in time whenever you want. Much more difficult to bear is the slight feeling that we are watching a kind of recorded play instead of a film."

En route, they have the usual sequence of \"Red River\" (1948) style escapades before encountering treachery on a fairly grand scale that puts the lives of themselves and their horses at risk. There is a bit of chemistry between the two men, their opposing characters creating the odd spark - and some humour - as their journey progresses.

It stars Kerwin Matthews as Lemuel Gulliver, June Thorburn as his fiancée Elizabeth, with support coming from Basil Sydney (The Emperor of Lilliput), Grégoire Aslan (King Brob), Mary Ellis (Queen), Charles Lloyd Pack (Prime Minister Makovan) & child actor Sherry Alberoni as Glumdalclitch. Filmed in England and Spain, it features stop-motion animation and special visual effects by Superdynamation genius Ray Harryhausen. Sher & Arthur Ross adapt for the screen with a loose reworking of the 18th-century English novel Gulliver's Travels written by Jonathan Swift. And music maestro Bernard Herrmann provides the score.\r\n\r\nSwift's biting satirical novel has been watered down and given a romantic edge for the family market. That said, as the kids are enjoying the froth and tickle, the adults will note that there's just enough caustic comment in the piece to get the message across. This adaptation has slimmed down the four parts of Swift's work to just the two; Lilliput land of the little people and Brobdingnag land of the giants. With our intrepid normal sized hero Gulliver and his stowaway fiancée Elizabeth under threat either way.\r\n\r\nWhile the script has its pleasing moments it is still only serving as a bridging work for Harryhausen's effects to be shown. Be it the giant and tiny people sequences or the perils that come to our undersized protagonists courtesy of a Gator and a Squirrel, it's these that the children will find beguiling. This, however, can not be said for Harryhausen aficionados or adults more accustomed to more modern advancements. For this is bottom rung for Harryhausen, not bad at all, yet although there's a charm here, and no one should ever dismiss the painstaking amount of time it took him to weave it together, the work is creaky and lacking the dynamism so befitting his best work.\r\n\r\nMajor bonus' come with the swirling and pounding score from Herrmann and the vibrant performance of Matthews. The role of Gulliver was first offered to Danny Kaye, which naturally makes sense given Kaye's previous work on Hans Christian Andersen some years earlier. That it was also offered to Jack Lemmon, though, makes no sense at all. Anyway, Matthews got the gig, and following on from his fine work in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, he laid down a marker in the fantasy adventure genre that secured him fondness from legions of fans throughout the years. A safe, colourful and pleasant enough piece if ultimately not one for most fantasy adventure fans to revisit often. 6/10"

It stars Horst Janson, John Cater, John Carson, Caroline Munro, Shane Briant, Lois Daine and Wanda Ventham. Out of Hammer Film Productions, music is by Laurie Johnson and cinematography by Ian Wilson.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSwashbuckling vampire slayer Captain Kronos (Janson) answers the call of his friend Dr. Marcus (Carson) to investigate the mysterious goings on in the village of Durward. Young women are being drained of all their youth, left at deaths door old and haggard. Aided by his trusty hunchbacked assistant, Professor Grost (Cater), Kronos’ search for the truth takes him to the Durward family estate…\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOne of the last great Hammer Horror movies, Captain Kronos – Vampire Hunter has done well to rise through the decades as a sort of culty camp horror classic. Initial plans were for it to hopefully kick start a series that would see Kronos fighting evil at any given place in time; Doctor Who with a sword and a taste for the ladies if you like. Clemens had some grand ideas for the movie, but was quickly brought down to earth when he was handed the production’s paltry budget. Barely released in Britain with little to no publicity, and this nearly two years after the film had wrapped! Kronos has had to fight more than one battle just to get recognised. Thankfully the advancements in home entertainments have ensured it a deserved place in the upper echelons of Hammer’s output.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe film is a collage of genres, part horror, part comedy, part swashbuckler adventure and part saucy seaside postcard romp, but it all works so well in the pursuit of making the audience have a good time. The writing flips the vampire legend away from the norm, infusing the narrative with a new vampyric foe. This crafty sod can operate in the daytime as it drains not blood, but youth! As the genius Professor Grost tells us, there are many types of vampires, and different methods are needed to execute any of them on any given day. So this isn’t a case of Kronos tracking down the guilty and using one of the trusty old methods used on Drac, oh no! Kronos and Grosty have to use trial and error to see what will work for this particular beastie. Wonderful!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn his journey Kronos liberates a beauty from the stocks, poor Carla (Munro) was found guilty of dancing on a Sunday, she can count herself lucky it wasn’t a stronger punishment. So cue mucho sexual shenanigans and barely concealed innuendo between the two pretty ones, with suggestive conversations about having each other and some fondling of the sword. Kronos will also waylay bullies, he has no tolerance for meat heads and cuts them down faster than Zorro ever could. This guy is a hero to the common people, an action man of substance and cunning guile, he likes to drink and toke, it’s criminal that he didn’t get his own series or sequels.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnder scrutiny the low budget is evident, where bare minimum of set dressing for the interiors and extended exterior shots are a necessity, while you might be surprised to realise there actually isn’t that many people in the story! But Clemens does a marvellous job with what he had to work with, really zipping it along and blending so many genre flavours with consummate ease. It’s a shame this was to be his only film directing effort. He even gets sparky performances from his cast, managing to sexualise Munro without flashing the flesh and turning Janson’s stiffness into one of the film’s assets!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCaptain Kronos – Vampire Hunter, a ball of fun that sticks its tongue firmly into its pulpy bloody strewn cheek. 8/10"

Caroline Munro is on hand as their lovely companion while Shane Briant & Lois Daine play the effete children of the aged Lady Durward (Wanda Ventham).  \r\n\r\nShot in 1972 but not released until 1974, \"Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter\" functions in the same world as Hammer’s Karnstein Trilogy, aka \"The Vampire Lovers\" (1970), \"Lust for a Vampire\" (1971) and \"Twins of Evil\" (1971). Tigon’s “Witchfinder General,” aka “The Conqueror Worm” (1968), is also in the same ballpark. “Captain Kronos” stands with the best of the lot and was intended to be a franchise. Unfortunately, Hammer had entered its decline and there would only be six more Hammer films until their revival three decades later.   \r\n\r\n“Captain Kronos” mixes sylvan swashbuckling adventure with mysterious Gothic horror, some inventive vampirism and a bit o’ camp (just a bit). Janson towers as the noble hero while Munro is her usual gorgeous self and Cater is amusing. There are actually several beautiful women (for which Hammer is known). The woodsy locations are exceptional and the Durward manor is sumptuous. Meanwhile the two inn confrontations are compelling. This movie should NOT be as obscure as it is.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes, and was shot in Black Park Country Park just west of London and nearby Elstree Studios, northwest of the city.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+/A-"

Nope, it's not good - there is far to much verbiage and nowhere near enough swashbuckling and impaling, but it's tongue is firmly in it's cheek and that makes it the more enjoyable. It's trying to be light-hearted and it knows the scenarios are predictable and the acting (especially from Caroline Munro) is as flat as it is occasionally hammy. Ketchup galore, some lovely pained expressions from the soon-to-be appetisers and a guest appearance from Wanda Ventham at the end top it off fine. It's eminently forgettable, but passes ninety minutes easily enough if you are in the mood for brain fodder with bite!"

Although top billing goes to the pathetically grotesque Lon Chaney as the bell-ringer \"Quasimodo\", I think the plaudits must go to Patsy Ruth Miller as the persecuted gypsy \"Esmerelda\" in this 1923 adaptation of Victor Hugo's story. The score is hauntingly effective as both battle prejudice, jealousy and enmity from high and low society; with plots for revolution against the rather despotic rule of Louis XI never far from the theme. Chaney's make up is not great, even by the standards of the day, and it would not look out of place in a \"Tarzan\" film, but that matters little to the wonderfully evocative efforts from director Wallace Worsley to enshrine this classical story of lust, power and sadness to film, with a narrative that emphasises more of the emotional aspects of the story than many of it's successors. Particularly effective is the use of light and staging (partly Parisian, partly Californian) too. 2¼ hours may look long, but this positively flies by - rarely, if ever, making you want it to hurry up. Great stuff."

His sons and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine (Hepburn),  variously plot to force him into a choice - but he himself has is own agendas as well.\r\n\r\nAn utter lesson in theatrical tropes shifted to the screen with brilliant results. Set over the Christmas period, Henry II has called all the family together to the family castle in France, for what proves to be a blindingly sharp game of human chess.\r\n\r\nEssentially it's one giant family squabble of huge political importance, a conniving dynasty war that could shape history. The script sizzles with literate smarts and firey dialogue, with performances from the top draw, while costuming, set design and Barry's melancholy score seal the deal for what is a true genre classic. 9/10"

        "content": "Katherine Hepburn is simply superb in this depiction of the truly dysfunctional relationship between Eleanor of Aquitaine, the estranged queen of England's King Henry II and her spouse. Peter O'Toole reprises his characterisation from \"Becket\" (1964), and together they spar and spat with aplomb. Aided by a wonderful screenplay from James Goldman that is full of sarcasm, pith and some wonderfully effective (and brutal) put-downs, we play through this most bizarre of family dynamics. It all centres around a Christmas court for which the Queen is released from her Salisbury house arrest to join the couple's three sons: the ambitious, but sexually ambiguous Richard (Anthony Hopkins), the King's favourite, but pretty weak John (Nigel Terry) and the clever, silent-type, Geoffrey (a lovely, understated, effort from John Castle) at Chinon, where they will also be joined by the young and naive Philippe II, King of France (Timothy Dalton). Director Anthony Harvey now presents us with a stylish and quickly paced illustration of just how this devious, untrustworthy and potentially murderous family were prepared to conspire and manoeuvre to ensure who, eventually, succeed to the English throne. Hepburn and O'Toole have a distinct and effective chemistry between them. She has the best lines, I think, and delivers them with a razor sharp wit - you are never quite certain what either she, or her equally and skilfully manipulative husband are plotting as the sons prove to be pretty selfish, fickle and sometimes quite imbecilic. The film looks great, the sets and costumes are spot on and the whole thing offers an excellent appraisal of the antics of a collection of shrewd 12th century despots."

        "content": "Gorgeous & Creepy Hammer Horror Winner. \r\n\r\nHammer Film Productions rework some of the classic Universal Studios mummy material to great effect. Directed by Terence Fisher, this is not a remake of the seminal 1932 movie of the same name. Starring Peter Cushing (John Banning), Christopher Lee (Kharis/The Mummy), Raymond Huntley (Joseph Whemple) and Yvonne Furneaux (Isobel Banning/Princess Ananka), the film is written by Jimmy Sangster and was filmed at Bray & Shepperton Studios in England and is photographed in Eastman Color. I mention the latter because Eastman Color has a different hue to it, something that makes this movie all the more affecting as a horror piece.\r\n\r\nThe plot sees three archaeologists (Stephen & John Banning & Joseph Whemple) desecrate the tomb of Egyptian Princess Ananka. This awakens Kharis, Ananka's blasphemous lover who was buried alive for his unlawful deeds. Taken from the tomb to London by Egyptian priest Mehemet Bey (George Pastell), the three archaeologists find they are being hunted down by the vengeful Kharis. The only salvation may come in the form of Isobel Banning who bears a striking resemblance to Princess Ananka.\r\n\r\nThis Mummy is adroitly directed by Fisher, his choreography for the action scenes is stunning. Lee's incarnation as the mouldy bandaged one is swifter than most, thus Fisher has him stalking around Victorian England one minute, then the next he's crashing thru doors or windows with brute strength - with murder his (its) only goal. It's a top performance from Lee as he really throws himself into the role, with his dead eyes ominously peering out from gauze swathed sockets sending those little shivers running down the spine. Technically the film belies the budget restrictions that was a staple of Hammer productions. The sets are very impressive with the Egyptian tomb set original and authentic looking, and the swamp based set-up nicely constructed. The latter of which provides two genuine horror classic moments, as first we see the Mummy for the first time as he rises from a foul bubbling bog, and then for the dramatic swampy finale. It's also atmospherically filmed by Fisher, with Jack Asher's photography utilising the Eastman Color to give off a weird elegiac beauty.\r\n\r\nThis is not about gore, Fisher and the makers wanted to thrive on atmospherics and implication, something they achieve with great rewards. The Mummy would prove to be very successful in Britain and abroad, thus ensuring Hammer would dig up more Mummy's for further screen outings, none of which came close to capturing the look and feel of this first makeover. Crisply put together and with another in the line of great Christopher Lee monster characterisations, this Mummy is essential viewing for the creature feature horror fan. 8/10"

It's story, while borrowing many elements from the 1940s Universal sequels, is quite good and this is probably the best version of the Kharis character ever filmed. Christopher Lee's interpretation brings an aggressive, monstrous, and emoting mummy, not the slow, lumbering version of the 1940s (apologies to Lon Chaney). A first rate offering from Hammer."

Your war, like all wars, glories in devastation and death.\r\n\r\nMysterious Island is a loose adaptation of Jules Verne's novel of the same name. It's out of Columbia Pictures and was filmed at Shepperton Studios in England with exteriors on the coast of Spain. Directed by Cy Endfield, with Ray Harryhausen working his stop motion genius for the creatures, it stars Michael Craig, Joan Greenwood, Michael Callan, Gary Merrill, Herbert Lom, Beth Rogan, Percy Herbert & Dan Jackson. Bernard Herrmann provides the score.\r\n\r\nThe plot sees three Union soldiers escaping in a gas balloon from a Confederate prison camp during the American Civil War. Also caught up in the escape is a Confederate rebel and a newspaperman. As they battle the elements they are forced to crash land on some island they think is in the Pacific. Here they encounter giant animals that threaten their survival. Soon two ladies are shipwrecked onto the island too, but the strange animals are not the only thing to worry about, the island volcano is close to eruption and they appear to not be the only humans on the island?\r\n\r\nThough something of a lesser light in the pantheon of fantasy adventure films, Mysterious Island, in spite of its flaws, is rather good fun. Dramatically it's OK, with the creatures particularly memorable, but those in search of a science story befitting Jules Verne are in for a let down (though some small science interest does come in the last quarter). This is an out and out desert island survival movie with some Harryhausen kickers. There's a nice group dynamic as soldiers from opposing sides are forced to come together to survive. While the arrival of \"posh stock\" ladies throws up a class distinction issue, that is nice, if not fully exploited.\r\n\r\nThere's the usual clichés of course, and as much as I enjoyed it as a red blooded man, did they really need to make Beth Rogan's newly made island dress the shortest in the land? And true enough, some of the matte paintings and effects have aged better in our childhood memories than actually on the print of the film. It's nicely photographed by Wilkie Cooper in Eastman Color using the Super-Dynamation process, but the film also suffers in parts for the restoration. For the prints that exist on DVD now are beset by spotting, fading and scratches. While of course the resolution now shows the flaws of the source material that were once never evident.\r\n\r\nStill this is a must have film for fantasy adventure enthusiasts.Yes, as with many Harryhausen based movies, the action sequences involving his creations light up an episodic picture. But with giant animals intent on eating our survivors, a Vernian turn of events in the last quarter, Herrmann's brilliant bombastic score and Rogan's dress! Who cares about routine narrative eh? 7/10"

A sequel to Tarzan the Ape Man (1932), it brings back Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane respectively, and then runs through scene after scene of pre-code and pre-computer effects excellence.\r\n\r\nPlot line is weak, but it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of entertainment things. Basically greedy ivory hunter Martin Arlington (Paul Cavanagh) and Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton as Jane's one time beau who has lost her to Lord of the Apes) travel into the jungle in search of Mutia Escarpment - the elephant burial grounds. Tarzan and Jane arrive on the scene after 20 minutes of film, which is the cue for Jane to make the two Khaki Fatigue wearing lads hot under the collar, and for Tarzan to literally have to fight for his woman - the animals - and his life!\r\n\r\nWhat unfolds in 105 minutes of film is a tale of simmering sexuality, raw animal instincts, brutal battles and some Simian scene stealing. Cedric Gibbons originally directed the picture, well he was there until MGM realised he wasn't up to the task and replaced him with a criminally uncredited Jack Conway, and Conway (The Easiest Way) was just the man to curl the toes of those waiting in the wings at censorship city.\r\n\r\nOK! The sexy angle is hard to ignore, and why anyone with a pulse would want to is anyone's guess! O'Sullivan is barely covered and Weismuller is in such fine shape he makes me wish I had never discovered booze and junk food! There is rumble in the jungle as Tarzan and Jane go for a swim, as he blows on her hair to wake her up (oh she sleeps in the raw by the way), and as the city boys revel in getting Jane to once again wear a \"city\" dress. This is just a point of reference to make us aware that the one time city girl has thrown off her sexual inhibitions and gone natural up in the tree tops. And did I mention a sexy silhouette scene? No? Well I have now.\r\n\r\nSo, casting aside the wonderful eroticism of it all, as an action film it's also superb. The technical tools available in the early 1930s are used to the max here, it matters not about dummies being flung about the place, or that men in monkey suits fill in while Cheetah is off having a smoke! Or even that the back projection work will appear crude to the X-Box generation, this is film making craft that enchanted those film lovers queueing at the theatre to see this back in 1934. Watching it now demands the utmost respect and admiration.\r\n\r\nSo, get ready for a native army who during their attacks specialise in firing arrows into the heads of the enemy. For Gorilla's who love to use boulders as weapons. For Tarzan to fight a lion, a crocodile and a rhinoceros. Watch in awe as there is Pachyderm Pandemonium, a pride of lions menacing our Jane, classy chimps proving smarter than your average human, and of course there are high grade gymnastics evident as well.\r\n\r\nThe Hays Code would soon come into play and dilute the Tarzan series, but still being able to see these early MGM Tarzan movies is akin to going to a film museum where only the open minded are invited. Wonderful. 10/10"

Albert Finney and Edward Fox, Tom Conti and an on form Robert Stephens as well Cristina Raines' charming effort as \"Adèle\" contribute well. All are dressed perfectly amidst settings that suit this gritty and battle-worn story perfectly, too. It's a cunningly devised theme, this - it has the obvious storyline, but also takes well aimed swipes at pomposity, the futility of war, and the stupidity of man - all in a manner that resonates cleverly, even now. It was clearly produced on a limited budget, which is apparent from time to time with the continuity (never one of Scott's strong suits) or with some overused extras amongst the soldiers - but, overall, it is a testament to what can be done in a relatively short film, with a good story and cast and some creative leadership behind the camera."

Right from the start, the pace of the dialogue is witty and engaging. Harrison - who can be terribly wooden on occasion, is well up for this spiritual lark as a seance at his home - under the supervision of the dotty Rutherford - releases his former wife \"Elvira\" back into his life where only he can see her; and she decides to cause the maximum amount of mayhem for her former husband and his new wife \"Ruth\". The nature of the story keeps the cast small, and the action is end-to-end with plenty to make you smile as well to appreciate the dynamics of wedded \"bliss\". It's a dream - though more of a nightmare for Rex!"

Back to Bataan is guilty as charged, yet such is the composition of Edward Dmytryk's film, and its focus on a part of the war we rarely have seen on film, it matters not.\r\n\r\nWe are in 1942, and after the fall of the Philippines to the Japanese, U.S. Army Col. Joseph Madden (John Wayne) stays behind to lead the local guerrilla resistance against the Japanese army. With that synopsis it isn't hard to figure out what sort of pic we are going to get, yet to purely consider this as a macho beefcake movie is a little unfair.\r\n\r\nSure it's bookended by blistering action, as Duke Wayne (very restrained turn actually) and Anthony Quinn cut a swathe through the RKO sound stages, but there's lots of intelligent human interactions here to mark it as being in the least knowing of the campaign.\r\n\r\nIt often grasps for the sentimental branch, while the racist barbs and portrayal of the Japanese does sting at times. But this is exciting and thoughtful stuff, boosted no end by Dmytryk's sturdy direction and Nicholas Musuraca's monochrome photography (a film noir lovers dream pairing!). Better than routine war movie. 7/10"

        "content": "I believe Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare based films are a great success. I don't mean that they got good reviews and made box office bank. For me, his **HENRY V** was the first time watching Shakespeare I was intrigued and, frankly followed the language and story. His **MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING** and his **HAMLET** reinforced my opinion.  I even thought it possible that we would eventually see 37-ish Shakespeare stories enjoyed by modern audiences. While it may still happen, its unlikely to be completely under the directorial eye of Branagh.\r\n\r\nMaybe others felt this way, as a new company was formed - _THE SHAKESPEARE FILM company_.  A production company under Branagh dedicated to Shakespeare productions.  The company underperformed considerably with **LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST** and was shuttered after the only slightly more promising follow-up...\r\n\r\n> **_AS YOU LIKE IT_**\r\n\r\nDuke Senior reigns over a happy community, until his jealous brother banishes the Duke and takes his throne by force.  The story follows the banished king's daughter as she navigates her love for a young farmer while under the gaze of the disapproving uncle.\r\n\r\nThis film has a high powered cast.  There is another lyrical score by Patrick Doyle.  The cinematography and production design are beautiful. Placing the story in Japan is intriguing. It has a lot going for it.  Yet, it seems muddy and unclear.\r\n\r\nThe first portion of the film confidently plants Shakespeare's story into a Shogun ruled Japan. Yet, the story seems to meander away from that until only the costuming suggests Japanese influence.  Maybe relocating the story to this cultural environment was a meal not fully cooked.\r\n\r\nBryce Dallas Howard carries the film as a smiling and intelligent Rosalind.  The excellent Alfred Molina is the clown whose scenes contain the only humorous material.  Much of Branagh's Shakespeare community fills in several roles including my favorite, Brian Blessed playing the empathetic banished king and his tyrannical usurping brother.  Depressingly, the usually wonderful Kevin Kline gives a quiet and toothless performance of Jaques which renders him forgotten by the time the credits role. Similarly wasted is Adrian Lester.\r\n\r\nBranagh certainly knows how to make money look good on screen.  His approach adapting the bard's work is not as strong or confident as his earliest efforts.  Maybe this says more about the original source, but there are surprising things that have to reflect today's choices. Most obviously, why is the plays most popular _All the world's a stage_ quote is delivered over a soft focus pan of Jaques sitting in the blurred distance.  It is lost and forgotten.\r\n\r\n**AS YOU LIKE IT** is leaps better than **LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST**, but not enough to keep the new _Shakespeare Film Company_ alive.\r\n\r\nOther filmmakers have stepped up and are offering great modern takes on Shakespeare without twisting his language and story to unrecognizable propaganda.  We may see the Shakespeare Cinematic Universe after all."

Starring are Richard Widmark, Gene Tierney, Googie Withers, Hebert Lom, Francis L. Sullivan, Mike Mazurki & Stanislaus Zbyszko. The score is composed by Franz Waxman and Max Greene is the cinematographer. It's shot on location in London, England.\r\n\r\nHarry Fabian (Widmark) is a hopeless dreamer, a two-bit hustler who aspires to make it big and never want for money again. Over hearing retired wrestling superstar Gregorius (Zbyszko) bemoaning the fake wrestling bouts put on by his underworld son Kristo (Lom), Fabian hatches a plan to set up his own wrestling empire backed by Gregorius. Thus he be safe from retribution from Kristo and his heavies. That is as long as Fabian does right by Gregorius and doesn't abuse his trust. Things get complicated, though, as Fabian needs money to back the venture, money he hasn't got. So systematically he drags into the equation his girlfriend Mary Bristol (Tierney), club owner Phil Nosseross (Sullivan) and Sullivan's wife, Helen (Withers). Pretty soon things start to spiral out of control.\r\n\r\nNight and the City has been called many things, from baroque masterpiece to being a turgid pictorial grotesque! Polar opposite reactions that have now, over time, dovetailed into a majority agreement from film noir purists that it is indeed one special piece of film noir movie making. The film opens in quite an unassuming way as the title sequence brings views of leisurely London, then Dassin does a voice-over telling us that \"The night is tonight, tomorrow night or any night. The city is London.\" We then cut to a man on the run, pursued by a person unknown. The man being chased is Harry Fabian, sharply attired in suit and hat, he has left pictorial London and is now running through bomb afflicted London, through murky alleyways. Until sanctuary comes at his girlfriend's tidy flat, the contrast between the two worlds of Harry Fabian neatly marrying American film noir with British kitchen sink-ism.\r\n\r\nHowever, that sanctuary is a rare ray of hope in Dassin's movie, a cunning trick by the makers, for Night and the City is ultimately a dark and brooding picture, one that deals in corruption & paranoia, with a pervading sense of doom hanging heavy like a death warrant issued by some heavy underworld crime lord. The characters in this part of London are mainly blank personalities, cold and calculating, crooked and immoral. That Fabian is only a lesser light, on the lower rung of this seamy ladder, is irrelevant, because he aspires to become just the same, only richer. Duplicity and betrayal are things he's happy to jump in bed with, and we the audience are part of it as we view this story through Fabian's hopeless and oblivious eyes.\r\n\r\nYet the movie, in spite of its uncompromising story, is by turns exciting & pacey, even breath taking, driven by one of the finest scores put down in film noir as Waxman prods and probes with pulse beats and deft ear clangers. With Greene's expressionistic and daring photography blending seamlessly with the mood crafted by director and composer alike. The cast are mostly strong, with Widmark, Zbyszko & Withers actually terrific, the latter involved in a superb wrestling sequence with Mazurki. At times heart pounding, at others wince inducing - if you find yourself holding your breath - then that's OK, it has that effect on many. Tierney was cast as a favour to Darryl Zanuck who was worried about Tierney's mental health at the time. She looks radiant and offers up an interesting counterpoint to all the darkness within the story. Dassin spoke very favourably of her work on the film, saying she was no trouble at all and a consummate professional.\r\n\r\nAs for Dassin himself? Well he was, thanks to the HUAC outcry, about to be out of work and on the run. He moved to Europe and never worked in America again, he returned from film making exile five years later where he would make the much revered Rififi in France. A truly excellent director, capable of pacing a film to precision and holding an audience in an atmospheric vice like grip. Night and the City is his masterpiece, and as it happens it is also one of film noir's greatest treasures. 10/10"

        "content": "Jules Dassin has assembled a top-drawer cast for this thriller. An on-form Richard Widmark (\"Fabian\") is a bit of a low-life grifter in London who encounters the huge, but ageing, champion wrestler \"Gregorius\" (Stanislaus Zbyszko) and concocts a plan that could make them both extremely wealthy men. Of course, the best laid plans never quite work out, and soon his internecine web of lies, deceit and sheer blind optimism have him on the back foot and at the mercy of his business partner \"Nosseross\" (Francis L. Sullivan) amongst others. The writing provides a framework that allows the actors to shine - sparing appearances from Gene Tierney (like Widmark, himself, just a touch fish-out-of water as ostensibly Londoners with an accent from anywhere but) work well, as does Googie Withers, Herbert Lom and the always dependable Sullivan. There is plenty of action, the pace builds well and there is some gripping wrestling action here too. You can't really help but feel a degree of sympathy for \"Fabian\" - try as he might, he just has that certain smell of failure abut him. The photography captures well the vivacity of a city still very much recovering from the Blitz, of the optimism of it's population and of the greed and materialism of those pulling strings. Well worth a watch, this film."

But it had significant strengths that made me quickly realize my fears were undeserved and that I, in fact, was in for a treat. The pace is whipcrack, the plot is intense and in Commissioner Lohmann, the villainous 'Goldfinger' (an excellent Gert Fröbe) pulls off a gritty cross between an Ed Asner and a Popeye Doyle-era Gene Hackman. I love how one of the ways Mabuse resorts to do away with pests pays homage to Lang's 'The Testament of Dr. Mabuse' from three decades prior. It certainly made me wary of churches, one-legged men and even laundry workers, for crying out loud, and part of the fear the film brings across is because in the back of our minds, we know this is precisely how the Nazis operated, studying fluoride as a mind-control agent. If there is any negative I got from the film, the Berlin police department (good ol' Lohmann notwithstanding) seemed the most unintelligent and incompetent sleuthing force this side of Inspector Clouseau. Definitely recommended for fans of thrillers and spy films."

The plot sees Woods as con-man Gabriel Caine, recently out of prison he and his cohort Fitz (Platt), set up a boxing \"sting\" in Diggstown, a hickville place out in Olivair County that is run by egomaniac John Gillon (Dern). The set-up entails Caine's old friend Honey Roy Palmer (Gossett Jr) having to fight, and beat, 10 Diggstown men in one day. As the money goes down and secrets come out, corruption and violence is never far away.\r\n\r\nMidnight Sting was one of those film's that came to my attention in the early hours of one morning. I couldn't sleep and turned the TV on out of pure frustration at a lack of sleep. What I didn't know at that time of irksome sleepy annoyance was that I would fall in love with a movie, a love that lasts to this very day. The TV announcer said the name of the movie and that it stars James Woods. Since Woods is always value for money I thought I would give it a go, for the next 98 minutes I laughed out loud, I cringed at some sad moments and I punched the air on more than one occasion. It quickly became one of my favourite movies of all time. On the surface it looks a very simple tale, but it has so much more to offer outside of the excellent fight sequences and some belting one liners. \r\n\r\nBased on Leonard Wise's novel \"The Diggstown Ringers\", the film deals in loyalties, friendships, greed, power, corruption and lies - not to mention small town mentality being under the microscope. It's impeccably acted as well, with the Woods and Gossett play off one of the most engaging duets of the 1990s. The twists within, and there are some corkers, really crown what was already a smart and witty script. It was a film that went largely unnoticed upon its release, and even now in this age of rampant internet usage it appears to still be under seen or sadly forgotten. It of course will not become a personal favourite of all newcomers to it, but just maybe one day if you can't sleep or you are stuck for a rental then you should give it a chance. Because it deserves a chance to at least try to welcome you into its fan club. \r\n\r\nI love it, you know that by now, and there's a chance that you will too. Punch the air brilliant. 10/10"

Up to this point, we’ve just suspected Lester’s intentions, but now our doubts are proved correct. Sudden Fear, a woman-in-jeopardy noir with Joan Crawford playing heiress, Myra Hudson—is the tale of a woman who may meet a foul end at the hands of her deceptive, less-than-loving husband, Lester. For a large chunk of the action, Myra is oblivious to her husband’s evil intentions, but since the plot lets the audience in on the threat, we are committed to the suspense from the start. As spectators, we know that Myra is in danger, and so we are riveted to Lester’s devious plan to rid himself of a wife he so obviously loathes. \r\n\r\nSudden Fear based on a novel by Edna Sherry, brought Crawford her third and final Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Directed by David Miller this 1952 film was the first picture Crawford made for RKO after asking to be released from her Warner Bros. contract. Crawford hated her last Warner Brothers film--This Woman is Dangerous. The film cast her in a rather spongy, implausible role as a female gangster who loses her eyesight and then turns soft and weepy when faced with a possible future as a happy little housewife. For noir fans, Sudden Fear showcases Crawford in one of her most powerful roles. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Sudden Fear begins, wealthy playwright Myra Hudson is in New York casting for her new play. Lester Blaine lands the part of the leading man, but during rehearsals, Myra finds him lacking as a romantic hero. She abruptly, publicly, and rather callously fires him on the spot. Myra’s advisors think she’s making a mistake, but since Myra always gets her way, a disgruntled and bitter Lester exits the stage. \r\n\r\nMyra’s play is a raging success, and she’s due to return home to San Francisco by train. Is it coincidence that Lester Blaine just happens to turn up as a passenger on the same train? Myra seems to think so, but in light of Lester’s humiliation, somehow, his statement that he has no hard feelings towards Myra just doesn’t feel right. On the train journey to San Francisco, Lester entertains and woos Myra, and by the time they reach their destination, Myra is in love. Lester seems to be the perfect lover, and he certainly has perfected the symptoms of an enamored man. He’s attentive, sensitive and gentle, and Myra, who’s smitten by the romance, seems oblivious to the differences in their ages and social status. \r\n\r\nMyra may be swept along with Lester Blaine’s smooth style, but for audience members, that niggling doubt remains. At this point, however, Lester’s game may be mean-spirited revenge, or perhaps he’s a pathetic loser after her money. But one brilliantly constructed scene clarifies Lester’s manipulation and Myra’s vulnerability. Lester fails to show up for an evening at Myra’s splendid home, and Myra ditches her guests to seek out her missing beau. While she dashes to his hotel, we see Lester pacing back and forth, waiting only for Myra’s arrival to begin a performance that involves his pride, a suitcase and a one-way trip back to New York. It’s with this scene and its clever camera shots that Lester is revealed as the center of power in the relationship, less-than-sincere and dangerously manipulative in his professions of love. \r\n\r\nAfter we become aware of Lester’s true intentions, the suspense moves away from the question of what Lester is capable of to when and how Myra will have an “accident.” The plot plays with scenes at Myra’s gorgeous coastal cliff top home. The steep stairway to the ocean, carved into rock offers the perfect location for a nasty accident. Since the audience knows that Lester has evil intentions towards his wealthy wife, we are riveted to Myra’s nimble walk (in high heels) down the rocky staircase. We can wince all we want at the spectacle of Myra’s potential danger, but we are powerless to warn her. \r\n\r\nAnother clever device used as a suspense builder by the film is the use of Myra’s recording machine. The plot reveals this nifty little piece of technology early in the film—along with a demonstration of its abilities. The machine is a crucial part of the plot, but as it turns out, machinery may be relied on for its usefulness, but it’s still subject to the vagaries of human emotion. \r\n\r\nThe plot thickens when tarty, brash Irene Neves (Gloria Grahame, one of my all-time favorite noir stars) arrives on the scene as Lester’s vicious love interest. Irene hasn’t been invited to San Francisco, but she wheedles her way into Myra’s exclusive set nonetheless. Greedy and amoral, she accelerates Lester’s desire for wealth, and together they make a lethal combination of lust, violence and murderous design. Clever camera shots of reflected images in mirrors reveal the main characters’ true emotions—Myra’s lawyer’s distrust of Lester, Irene planning murder, Lester’s mask of loving, doting husband suspended, and Myra horrified by just how far she’ll go. \r\n\r\nThe film’s plot is as well rounded as a Greek tragedy, with just desserts for those who concoct evil ends for others. But it’s the delivery of those just desserts that makes for riveting viewing. The city of San Francisco assumes a spectacular role in Sudden Fear. The film includes great shots of the city, and it’s played here as both an ambivalent setting for nefarious actions, and also as a rat’s maze in the frenzied, final action-packed scenes. The city’s inanimate beauty serves to highlight urban indifference to its inhabitants’ actions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSudden Fear gives Crawford a terrific role and gives her the chance to act her heart out. Here she’s the tough, cold businesswoman who melts with Lester’s continued interest. Weakened by emotion and threatened by violence, she spends one hysterical terror-filled night in the shifting shadows of her bedroom before going on the offensive in the no-one-fucks-with-Joan role fans love so much. The fact that Myra is a successful playwright is artfully weaved into the story when she imagines she can write her way out of a real-life problem just as she would write a script for one of her plays. Myra’s attempt to script her own life is seen in a series of imagined flash-forward sequences. Unfortunately, since she is dealing with real people and not fictional characters, there’s an element of unpredictability that even Myra can’t anticipate. Just as the timing in a play must be precision perfect, Myra’s scheme also relies on split second sequencing. The film uses the ticking of a clock to emphasize the crucial timing involved in Myra’s plan. The clock ticks away like a metronome with the action and nerve-wracking suspense building to a frenzied, orgasmic, and deadly conclusion. \r\n\r\n\r\nWritten by Guy Savage"

Coffee and Robert Smith from the novel written by Edna Sherry. It stars Joan Crawford, Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame. Music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Charles Lang Jr. \r\n\r\n\"Miss Hudson, in your own native city of San Francisco, there's an art gallery in the Legion of Honor in which there's an oil painting of Casanova. It's quite obvious that you have never seen this painting. For your information, Miss Hudson, this is what Casanova looked like. He had big ears, a scar over one eye, a broken nose, and a wart on his chin, right here. I suggest, Miss Hudson, that when you return to San Francisco, you visit this gallery and see this painting!\" \r\n\r\nThe above is the response Lester Blaine (Palance) gives to Broadway playwright Myra Hudson (Crawford) who has just rejected him for the lead role in her latest play on account of his looks. Later that day the pair meet up on a train heading for Frisco and Myra is swept off of her feet. They court and marry, but once finances come into play and Irene Neves (Grahame) arrives on the scene, something far more sinister begins to rear its head \r\n\r\nIt takes a while to get going, but once Sudden Fear hits its stride it's a suspenseful noirish delight. Filmed on locations in San Francisco and with Lang Junior bringing the chiaroscuro and Miller dabbling in deftly placed shadows and tracking cameras, there's a visuality that's vital to the edgy atmosphere of the story. It's pretty obvious quite early on what is happening in the plotting but this never affects the suspense, Miller builds it slowly and then unleashes the chills at the midpoint, garnering top performances from the three principal players in the process. It's ready made material for Crawford, where she gets to run through her repertoire of female emotions, while Palance enjoys playing the villain and Grahame slinks in to view in the way that only she can. \r\n\r\nSome trimming of the running time wouldn't have gone amiss, and some of Myra's stamina powers in the final quarter stretch the faith a touch, but all told it's a very good \"woman in peril\" noir that is crowned by a terrifically exciting ending. 7.5/10"

Soon we discover that Palance has been in cahoots with girlfriend Gloria Grahame and they have desires on his new wife's considerable fortune. When Crawford announces plans to leave much of her cash to charity; they hasten their plans but she finds out and devises a clever plan of her own. There is plenty of jeopardy, right until the end of this gripping, tense and superbly scored (by Elmer Bernstein) film noir."

The result was TARGETS (1968), which proved to be too topical for many theaters to touch when it initially appeared. That's a shame, because it provided Karloff with an A-level role as the sun set on his life and career. Bogdanovich tells parallel stories which converge at the finale: One involves a young man who turns to bloodshed when he feels that he has nothing ahead of him; the other revolves around an aged film star who believes that everything is behind him. Timely when released because of the social climate; timely now because of the politically charged debate over gun control; and ultimately - thanks to the presence of the great Karloff - timeless."

        "content": "**_As relevant today as it was when it was made_**\r\n\r\nAn aged horror icon (Boris Karloff) wants to retire because he’s weary of the biz and thinks modern life has become more horrifying than his old-fashioned movies. But a director/writer (Peter Bogdanovich) encourages him to read an atypical script or, at least, attend a promotional appearance at a drive-in, which is showing his latest movie, “The Terror.” Unfortunately, a young ordinary man (Tim O'Kelly) has snapped and is on a killing spree with the drive-in being his final shooting range.\r\n\r\n“Targets” (1968) is a minor cult masterpiece, a self-conscious postmodernist piece inspired by the “Texas Tower Sniper” from August 1, 1966, who killed 14 people and wounded 31 others at the University of Texas at Austin. Bobby (O'Kelly) is patterned after the lunatic murderer with the setting simply switched to the San Fernando Valley in SoCal. \r\n\r\nI took the flick as a bleak commentary on the way it simply is in America rather than a criticism of the 2nd Amendment. After all, outlawing alcohol during Prohibition didn’t stop people from selling & purchasing booze and neither have drug laws in the modern day stopped people from selling & buying illegal drugs. Evil doesn’t exist in a gun, knife, club or rock, but in the hearts of people bent on taking innocent lives for their own evil purposes.\r\n\r\nPlus, as clichéd as it may sound, the quickest way to stop an evil person with a gun is by a good person with a gun (certainly not an elderly man with a cane). A good recent example is the case in Charleston, West Virginia, on May 25, 2022, where a brave woman shot an active shooter dead before he was able to murder anyone gathered at an apartment complex. Dissolving the 2nd Amendment would only prevent law-abiding citizens from buying/owning firearms; it wouldn’t prevent wackos intent on bloodshed from purchasing firearms on the black market.  \r\n\r\nTo support this, Bobby panics at the climax precisely because some male viewers at the drive-in have grabbed their legal guns to take care of the sniper. Keep in mind that producer Roger Corman sold the movie to Paramount rather than release it through AIP. After the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy the studio released only six prints and prefaced the flick with a statement advocating gun control. Director Bogdanovich had zero to do with this.\r\n\r\n“Targets” works as an interesting psychological study: What is it that causes Bobby to ‘snap’ and ruin his life by going on a crazed killing spree? His respectable-yet-intimidating father has properly trained him on firearm safety, but he has also inadvertently made his son a frustrated weakling — a bomb just waiting to go off. The disease of legalism is all over his parent’s household, where the young couple resides. Look at the clues.\r\n\r\nThis was one of Karloff’s last movies. He passed away 5.5 months after its release at the age of 81. Thankfully, he plays an interesting protagonist, a hero even, rather than some cheesy boogeyman for the millionth time. Plus I enjoyed the levity provided by his character and Bogdanovich’s, which counterbalances the stark, depressing vacancy of the rest of the story. \r\n\r\nReally, the flick is about the thin line between reality and art, the relationship between real-life and films. For instance, the killer loading his rifle is paralleled with the projectionist loading his projector at the drive-in. Also, the slayer confuses the old man intently moving toward him with the actor’s character on the big screen. It’s equally about the decline of morals and banalization of life in the modern day, particularly America and Western Culture, where we’ve lost our spiritual compass and sense of purpose.\r\n\r\nLastly, the easy access to firearms can culminate in deadly expression of pent-up frustration and anger, which is just below the surface in some otherwise perfectly normal people. Again, the most effective way to stop ’em with the least amount of bloodshed is a good person with a gun, who’s on the scene. ’Nuff said.      \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles, including Van Nuys, Hollywood, West Hollywood and Reseda.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

She thinks she has lucked out with a champagne and caviar film actor, but is soon further disillusioned and it is only a chance encounter with the rather unassuming \"D'Onofrio\" (François Périer) who had admired her on stage one evening, that things might - just might - offer our wandering spirit that which her heart desires most. Fellini uses the still largely war-torn streets of Rome as an effective backdrop to this most human of stories, and the writing allows Miss Masina to deliver her quick-fire, frequently comical (and always unerringly optimistic) dialogue expertly. She is very much in her element as the story develops. There is an air of cynicism to the whole thing, but somehow her character manages to punch through it - and that's what made this entertaining for me. It could have been just a procedural and predictable drama, but it isn't. There are no certainties with the plot. Indeed, the only certainty is that she is never going to give up! The supporting cast deliver really effectively - either as characters with a direct bearing on her life (\"Wanda\" (Franca Marzi) for example) or as a means for the audience to recalibrate and come up for air for a moment or two. It's an emotional film, but not a sentimental one - and I really enjoyed it"

It still holds up incredibly well. In a time where zombie films and TV shows were starting to come up (The Walking Dead premiered one year later), this post-apocalyptic zombie comedy flick still remains as one of the best zombie movies of the century. Their use quickly became something cliche, and neither funny or scary. Nowadays, people are used to seeing the living dead on the screen all the time, so why does a 2009's film like this still work?\r\n\r\nWell, first of all, the outstanding cast is halfway through success. In 2009, only Woody Harrelson was already a renowned adult actor. Emma Stone and Jesse Eisenberg didn't star in anything truly remarkable yet, so much that Abigail Breslin was more recognizable than them. Even with only 13-years-old, she already had an Oscar nomination in a supporting role (Little Miss Sunshine). However, everyone delivers fantastic performances, which carry the simplistic yet entertaining story to such a success that it became a zombie classic.\r\n\r\nHarrelson portraying Tallahassee, the guy who's not scared of anything and likes to \"enjoy the little things\", is one of his career's coolest roles. Eisenberg is not exactly the type of actor I like since he can only do so much with his acting abilities. He always offers the same type of character: a quirky, twitch-full, idiosyncratic personality, which most of the times doesn't work. Contrary to this tendency, Columbus is a character that logically and hilariously fits this model, hence Eisenberg is the movie's primary source of comedy. From his list of rules to his weird behavior, everything feels natural since the character's background justifies his awkward self.\r\n\r\nStone and Breslin share great moments together, as well as Harrelson and Eisenberg, but the former duo has less exciting sequences. Nevertheless, even though the girls could have received more character development, their relationship gives them a compelling reason for us to care about. Wichita might just look like the cliche hot girl who falls for the good guy, but she would do anything to protect her sister, and her love for Little Rock does give her some gravitas. The cast's chemistry is undeniably astonishing. It's visually palpable that they had tons of fun doing this film, and that elevates every single conversation or action scene.\r\n\r\nThe short runtime allows for a fast-paced story, packed with fun moments, and a lot of bloody zombie killings. The production design is remarkable. Excellent use of practical effects and real sets, plus a perfect soundtrack. Ruben Fleischer knew precisely what he wanted the movie to be, and he never tried to make it something more. Yes, it still involves a romance of sorts, and some backstories might not be funny or joyful. However, it never feels forced or fabricated. It never overextends its stay because Zombieland is neither a romance or a drama. It's purposefully campy, plays with stereotypes creatively, and it's merely 88 minutes of good fun. We are in 2019, and studios forgot how to make films like this!\r\n\r\nEvery year, there are dozens of blockbusters that would be extremely entertaining if studios would just let them be what they are meant to, but no. They need to have some relevant story that carries a political tone or a social message. Zombieland has all the attributes of a pure blockbuster: a phenomenal cast, a straightforward narrative packed with thrilling sequences, a short runtime with fast pacing, compelling characters, and thousands of zombies. Put together a funny screenplay filled with chuckle-worthy jokes, and you have yourself one of the best zombie movies of the century. It's one of those films which don't exactly have what people address as \"flaws\". Zombieland has its cliches and lazy exposition, but it heavily compensates them with 80 minutes or so of spectacular entertainment. It's a zombie cult classic. Nut up or shut up, but watch the goddamn movie!\r\n\r\nRating: A-"

It follows a zany cast of characters with big personalities thrust into a post-apocalyptic landscape. However, rather than living in constant fear and survival, it feels as if the characters consider it all another Tuesday. Their motivations are finding twinkies or love rather than escaping death. This tonal twist leads to a very entertaining, self-aware plot that takes funny jabs at traditional zombie tropes. The cast nails this tone as well, with Harrelson, Eisenberg, and Stone all delivering sarcastic yet genuine and caring performances."

It may ultimately lose itself to a standard conspiracy plot, but there's intelligence within to make Surrogates a better film than it first appears. 7/10"

He then uses all his power and connections to pin the crime on another man seen close to the crime. George Stroud (Ray Milland), editor of Janoth's own Crimeways magazine, is put in charge of tracing the mystery man. Which is fine until he finds that as he digs deeper, all the evidence points to he himself being the fall guy! \r\n\r\nOstensibly film noir it may be, but The Big Clock still has something to offer even the most casual of cinema goer. Directed by the still criminally undervalued John Farrow, The Big Clock has a touch of the Alfred Hitchcock \"wrong man\" theme about it. Based on a novel written by Kenneth Fearing, Farrow and his writer, Jonathan Latimer, have managed to craft a piece that is both twisty and unique in its execution. With both things working towards a quite clever and suspenseful ending. \r\n\r\nAs with the best of film noir, The Big Clock has an intricate plot that's awash with dubious characters and sexual ambiguity. Headed by Laughton's tyrannical philandering Janoth (apparently based on real life publisher Henry Luce), the piece boasts what maybe a gay scar-faced right hand man? (George Macready) and a butch masseur henchman (Harry Morgan playing against type). Only in the wonderful world of film noir can such characters not only exist, but also be so riveting within the film's structure. The piece is also very funny, particularly when Elsa Lanchester's batty artist Louise Patterson is on the screen. I almost fell off my chair laughing during one scene as she hands in a sketch of the wanted man, Picasso would have been proud! \r\n\r\nBut ultimately it's the story and Ray Milland's ability to see it through that wins the day. Even with the odd little problem, such as the underusing of Maureen O' Sullivan as Stroud's wife, Georgette, thus the domestic strife feels like filler. The Big Clock still finishes as an excellently constructed picture containing interesting thematics on time (this will be down to the individual viewer) that's cunningly set in amongst a media empire environment. Remade with some success in 1987 as a political thriller (No Way Out), The Big Clock still remains the essential film to see. Crime, mystery, drama, comedy and a thriller, it has a little for everyone, even if it is basically a film noir treat. 9/10"

It clearly had a tiny budget, none of which was spent on a decent script, and you just know you are never going to get this 90 minutes of your life back again, but the character names are mildly amusing and the cast - especially Marcia Warren and Pam Ferris seem to be having a laugh too - with or at is anyone's guess.

But he then finds that the killer is shadowing him and targeting anyone who files in to help his investigation.\r\n\r\nDario Argento’s Deep Red (AKA: Profundo Rosso/The Hatchet Murders) is rightly regarded as one of the leading lights of Giallo. Argento pitches Marcus Day (David Hemmings working from a splinter of Blow Up) into a rousing and visceral world of murder and mystery – and takes the viewers along as well! It doesn’t matter what time of day or night it is, Argento always has a sinister edge pulsing through his movie. The mystery element is also strong, including for first time viewers a cheeky opportunity to solve it very early on.\r\n\r\nPainting it all in vivid coloured strokes, Argento unleashes a myriad of stylish sequences, adding in children’s toys and mannequins to further up the creep factor. Musically not all of it works, but the running children’s thematic motif works strikingly well. Negatively the dubbing is often iffy at best and some of the now infamous murder sequences veer close to comedy because the director allows them to be protracted.\r\n\r\nUncompromising, thrilling and striking, some quibbles aside, Deep Red is a very positive experience. 7.5/10"

Notable for the screen debut of Jack Lemmon, Holliday had great screen chemistry with both suitors of her love triangle, Lemmon and Peter Lawford. In today's media-obsessive and Facebook-oriented culture, where selfies and 'food porn' are splashed online whenever people leave their homes, I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if this got remade with contemporary twists (here, Holliday pays part of her life savings, simply because she wants her name, 'Gladys Glover', on the largest billboard of New York City, after she loses a modeling job for being too fat--and chaos ensues when Lawford's company, who's father has always utilized that billboard for their ad campaign every summer, wants to know why it's reserved, and with simply the huge words, 'Gladys Glover' on it.\r\n\r\nLemmon's doings, both in being so intrigued by her that he moves into her apartment building, right across the hall from her, and in making a documentary film about their meeting, when he incorrectly thinks he's licked and that she's chosen Lawford as her partner, were very nice touches, from the Garson Kanin script. If you come across a film that comes from one of his screenplays, don't hesitate for a moment. Chances are very good that you're in for a real treat.\r\n\r\nA documentary DVD extra on Lemmon's life and career (which I believe was on my copy of 'Glengarry Glen Ross', but I may be wrong) is called 'Magic Time: A Tribute to Jack Lemmon'. It's great, and well-worth checking out. He sometimes gets short shrift amongst cinephiles because he mostly does comic roles, but he didn't get two Oscars and eight nominations overall for nothing. Though he's more well-known both for his films with Walter Matthau, and as the alter ego of Billy Wilder in seven of his films, check this out if you've ever been a fan. You'll be very pleasantly surprised by this little gem."

Music is by Roy Webb and cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca. \r\n\r\nUpon tending to attempted suicide victim Margo Lannington (Domergue), Dr. Jeff Cameron (Mitchum) falls in love with her and quickly finds his life spiralling out of control. \r\n\r\nClassic noir fable here, which begs the question on why is it not better known? More so when you consider it stars noir icon and legend Robert Mitchum? OK! Big Mitch never once convinces as a life saving doctor, but for a sad sap heavy eyed portrayal who you gonna call? Why Mitch of course. Thus the pic actually gets away with this odd bit of character casting, as it does the average performance from the otherwise lovely Domergue. Domergue was being pushed forward as Howard Hughes' latest siren of the screen, she would never attain great status, but she would grace many a \"B\" picture and become a cult fan favourite. \r\n\r\nDr. Cameron has it all, a great job and a pretty nurse (O'Sullivan) who loves him very much, but one peer into the puppy dog eyes of Margo Lannington and he's in hook, line and sinker. Film essentially turns into a lovers on the lam story as the two lovers head for the border after leaving the scene of a crime. As the journey progresses and gets ever more perilous, Margo begins to show erratic behaviour, while Jeff is struggling badly with a concussion that grows evermore acute. They meet an assortment of odd or unsavoury characters, a low life car dealer, weasel pawn broker, shyster club owner, the latter of which is currently airing a rather bizarre cabaret show. \r\n\r\nThey stop over in a noirville town where it's \"Whisker Week\", a backwater place where you are required to traditionally sport face fuzz on this particular week. Not only that but Margo and Jeff, minus whiskers and in confused states, end up being coerced into a bonkers marriage ceremony. It's all deliciously off kilter, the characterisations and situations marrying up deftly with Margo and Jeff's mental disintegration. Farrow adds his own directorial flourishes to the edgy mix, and Musuraca's photography is consistently gorgeous. All told it's as safe as noir houses for those of such noirish peccadilloes. 7.5/10"

Despite the attempts, there is not a single sympathetic or palatable character, the script does not help and the feeling that hangs in the air is of a lack of connection and solidity in the final product that can only be explained if we think about the way the director wanted to be. abstract by force.\r\n\r\nEverything takes place around a chic striptease club, Exotica, in Toronto. There is a dancer who enchants not only a client who goes to see her every day, but also the presenter, who is her ex-boyfriend and one of the most possessive and unhappy people we can imagine. Add to this an animal trafficker with problems admitting homosexuality who is forced to participate in a revenge plan, and we have a film that we probably won't want to see more than once.\r\n\r\nAtom Egoyan gives us firm direction, but a much less secure and solid script. I like the way it addresses loss, trauma, the feeling of denial of reality and grief. However, to believe that a woman would set up an elegant strip club and her daughter would have the courage to take over the “family business” is to completely ignore the realities of these commercial establishments, where legality and illegality sometimes go hand in hand. A real luxury house would never hold private sessions on tables in the main room for a low price, but in separate rooms for a much higher price, and real strippers don't usually dance to the same music and use the same stage number constantly. There are also huge holes that the script never explains and that are left hanging. For example, why did Christina decide to become a stripper if it is clear, from the characters' words, that that is not the place she deserved to be.\r\n\r\nBruce Greenwood is the actor who deserves the most praise for his work here. He is the only one trying to break the ice and reach out to the public in some way, and that deserves an applause from us. Elias Koteas is not that good, but he also does work that can be considered positive. Mia Kirshner, on the other hand, seems to be disinterested and just trying to make some money without much effort. Don McKellar is no better, and Arsinée Khanjian has an absolutely ill-conceived and poorly made character.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, it is an uninteresting film, to say the least. It is within the range of what one would expect to find in a film with aspirations to be commercial, but which seems to be more popular with festivals and film cycles than with the mass public. The positive highlight is the design of the strip club scene, something tropical I would say, and the soundtrack, which includes a good song by Leonard Cohen."

Leonetti.\r\n\r\nWell it’s a good day for a killing.\r\n\r\nWalter Hill homages and parodies the splinter of action cinema that encompasses the grizzled law enforcer tracking the bad guy, who in this case, was once a friend. That’s the basic set up for Hill’s brooding and bloody Extreme Prejudice. Action takes place down on the US/Mexico border, Ranger Jack Benteen (Nolte) is hunting his one time pal - and the man he shares his woman’s love with – Cash Bailey (Boothe), who has taken up drug smuggling as his employment of choice. Complicating matters is that there is a gang of ex-forces specialists in the town ready to raid the bank for some funds and documents to nail Bailey. Loyalties are tested, twists, turns and bloody shocks do follow.\r\n\r\nMuch of the film’s strength is gained from the casting, it’s a roll call of macho performers who combined make up a CV with enough beef to feed the third world. Even Alonso as the sole female of note fits the requisite toughness exam (she would do The Running Man this same year and go on to star in Predator 2). Much of the narrative involves brooding and tough talk, a slow burn approach from Hill who adds some meat to the bones of the main characters. Photography is pleasing, with actual locations shimmering on the screen, and Goldsmith’s score is a pulser that is a fore runner to his score for Total Recall 3 years later.\r\n\r\nAt times it’s offbeat, at others it’s gripping in its sweaty intensity, and then there is the balletic violence which Hill has proven himself to be an astute purveyor of, crowned here by his homage to Peckinpah’s glorious finale in The Wild Bunch.\r\n\r\nLean and tough with bodies and butchness everywhere. 7.5/10"

It maybe doesn't have the classic visual tics of yesteryear, but it has photographic style to burn - with Clapton's score suitably melancholic, which in turn is something that sits perfectly with the perpetual sense of doom that pervades the pic.

Sadly, Allman is a weak villain, maybe because he looks like a Rick Wakeman clone?! While under using Sam Elliott is just a plain waste. However, this deserves its place on neo-noir lists. It is deliberate in pacing, therefore asking for you to buy into the thematics at work, to let them itch your skin, but to do so has rewards, for in true noir style it doesn't chicken out once the end credits have rolled. 7.5/10"

This story offers us nothing at all new, indeed the DMX character is pretty odious from the get-go - especially when he decides to get his independently minded girlfriend hooked on heroin because she won't move in with him. It is gritty; there is a distinct plausibility about the way he lived his life; thoughtless and selfish, ruthless and devious. In parallel, we also feature a storyline about \"Michael\" (a competent Michael Ealy) who is making sure he avenges the killing even though he is a much more decent individual. Plenty of musicians have tried to cross to cinema and most can't hack it. Despite a reasonable effort with some dialogue that is nowhere near as banal as I'd expected, DMX relies too much on his own persona and charisma - of which he has plenty - rather than trying to imbue anything into his character, about whom I really couldn't have cared less. His own narration is sometimes quite withy and observational, but despite the frequency realistic drug abuse scenes, this still all quite well paced, but completely forgettable stuff."

        "content": "Odd and insightful road movie fantasy with James Marsden, Gary Oldman and Christopher Lloyd\r\n\r\n“Interstate 60:Episodes from the Road” involves a confused college man, Neal Oliver (James Marsden), who wants to be an artist while his father pressures him to go to law school. He desperately wants answers and O.W. Grant (Gary Oldman) magically grants him his wish. Neal ends up on the non-existent I-60 traveling to the non-existent city of Danver where he hopes to meet his dream girl (Amy Smart). Along the way he meets many interesting people and learns several valuable lessons. Christopher Lloyd is also on hand along with glorified cameos by various notable actors (e.g. Michael J. Fox, Kurt Russell and Ann-Margret).\r\n\r\nThe plot starts out a little tortuous, but it morphs into a road movie before too long, broken up into several quirky segments, which is why the flick is subtitled “Episodes from the Road.” Critics deride the picture on the grounds that the messages are clunky, moralistically naive, and preachy. But it’s unique and intelligent with quality reflections about life, which are made simple so “stupid people” or teens can grasp them. In short, this is a fairly entertaining oddball road fantasy that’s distinctive and insightful.\r\n\r\nIf you like films like \"Michael\" (1996), \"City of Angels\" (1998), \"Holy Man\" (1998), \"Bruce Almighty\" (2003) and “Evan Almighty” (2007), “Highway 60” (2002) is cut from the same thematic cloth, except that the supernatural being is a magical Irishman.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 56 minutes and was shot in Ontario (Sunderland, Cannington and Toronto) and Arizona (Phoenix).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

Steve Carrell leads this heartwarmingly delightful, funny film with a fresh premise different from other kid's movies, hilariously lovable characters, and superb execution. Being one of my three-year-old's favorites, I have seen this movie 100 times, and it doesn't get old. Cartel's voice acting is as entertaining as possible, and the Minions are just a masterstroke of brilliance that my daughter exclaims, \"it's so cute!\" every time they're on the TV. But this animated heist film becomes much more as three orphaned girls warm the heart of criminal mastermind Gru as he grows from an evil loner to a caring father. Despicable Me was as touching as hilarious, and its creativity and fantastic characters make it my absolute favorite animated film of all time."

Starring alongside Hossein are Michèle Mercier, Anne-Marie Balin, Daniele Vargas, Guido Lollobrigida and Serge Marquand. Music is by Andre Hossein and cinematography by Henri Persin.\r\n\r\nAfter being forced to watch the lynching of her husband by the ruthless Rogers family, Maria Caine (Mercier) asks her inept brothers-in-law for help in retribution. Getting no joy from the pair, she seeks outside help in the form of fast gun Manuel (Hossein), a loner living in solitude out at a ghost town...\r\n\r\nIt's dedicated to Sergio Leone, who directs one of the best scenes in the film, contains the Argento factor, so it's not really a shock to proclaim that Leone's influence is all over Hossein's movie. \r\n\r\nIt's a Pasta Western that operates in the void between the real and the spirit world, deliberately ethereal in tone, even sprinkling dashes of the surreal onto the hearty portion. Dialogue is used sparingly, but not to the detriment of films quality, and Hossein the director dallies in black and white staging, slow zooms and excellent usage of sound effects.\r\n\r\nMuch like the dialogue, the violence is pared down, there's no Blunderbuss infused blood laden approach to the evil that men do here, it's all very controlled and in keeping with the tonal flows that Hossein favours. The cliché's of the sub-genre are adhered to throughout, thankfully so, while the finale is suitably melancholic.\r\n\r\nThoughtful, sombre and ripe with blurry ambiguity, Cemetery Without Crosses is comfortably recommended to the Euro Western fan. 8/10"

Director/writer/star Robert Hossein was admittedly inspired by Sergio Leone and you can see the influence of “For a Few Dollars More” (1965). Speaking of which, one of the best scenes in the movie, the amusing dinner sequence at the Rogers’ ranch, was guest-directed by Sergio Leone. \r\n\r\nThis is a competent Spaghetti Western with a quality score, the usual Spanish locations and a good cast with three beautiful women (Mercier, Anne-Marie Balin & Béatrice Altariba). I like the serious tone, the ambiance and attractive cinematography, but it’s too flat of an experience, disregarding the dinner scene. Simply put, it becomes one-dimensional and tedious as it moves along. \r\n\r\n“The Hellbenders,” aka “The Cruel Ones” (1967), was less proficient, but at least it entertained. “Doc” (1971) is a good comparison, but it had a superior cast and way more perks. Even “Navajo Joe” (1966) is more memorable IMHO. But if you like Euro Westerns give it a try. Some cinephiles rave about it.     \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in Almería, Andalucía, Spain.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-"

Now \"Candella\" has been an integral part of this close-knit community for a very long time. He is treated almost like a son by \"Ma Rome\" and is pretty conflicted as he balances what is right for his job with his local loyalties and his conscience. Things take a turn for the worse for \"Rome\" when his girlfriend \"Teena\" (Debra Paget) starts to become embroiled in the investigation and quickly he is faced with tough choices that could put lives at risk as they go into hiding before trying to flee. This is a well paced and scored thriller with an on form Conte rather effective as the borderline smug hoodlum gelling well with both the flighty Paget and the at times almost menacing Mature. It twists and turns a little, giving us a slight indication of the internecine fashion in which these \"Little Italy\" communities were built and thrived, and the denouement is not quite what you might expect. A tight cast help keep the story focussed and make for an intriguing crime drama with just a little bit extra."

We follow the protagonist Al Roberts on the road, and watch (with accompanied narration) a sequence of events that see him in the middle of nowhere at a diner fearing for his future.\r\n\r\nDevilishly dark in tone, the film relies on a fine underplayed performance from Tom Neal as Roberts, and a gloriously annoying harpy femme fatale turn from Ann Savage as Vera. The film was made for next to nothing in only one week, and the whole film screams out as a low budget movie shot with a sleazy tint and less than stellar tech credits. Yet money can't buy this type of atmospheric misery, where the vagaries of fate play their brutal film noir hands.\r\n\r\nUpon release, it was just a poverty row \"B\" picture, and it passed by almost quietly. Unsurprisingly a few years later \"French\" cineastes picked up on it and as the years rolled by it has garnered critical reappraisals. So much so the likes of Scorsese and The Coen Brothers cottoned on and gleefully let the influence wash over them. Director was one Edgar G.

An implausibly weak Tom Neal, a downright irritating Ann Savage & an especially wooden Claudia Drake make this something you might win a perseverance award for, for sticking with. Tom Neal is driving across the USA when he makes a decision he soon regrets - picking up a rude, gobby woman (Ann Savage) on the highway who proceeds to rob, bully & blackmail him. Accidentally, she comes a cropper and (aside from a general feeling of thank the Lord from the audience) his relief is palpable. The route to his predicament is relayed via his somewhat pathetic retrospective narrative and her relentless onslaughts and they both combine to really grate after a while (say 20 minutes). It has little to redeem it, I'm afraid - neither the photography nor the script inject much pace and/or menace - it's just a tiresome tirade."

Plot essentially centers around the 1966 Formula 1 motor racing championship, with James Garner, Yves Montand, Brian Bedford, Eva Marie Saint and Toshiro Mifune heading up the large ensemble cast list. It deals with the trials and tribulations of the drivers, both on and off the track.\r\n\r\nThe human drama is a bit soapy, of which there is much, yet these narrative characterisations help to make us care and understand the protagonists at the core of the story. And of course when the drivers are out there on the track, we know their psychological make-ups, their driving mirroring their motives and emotional fortitude.\r\n\r\nThe racing segments are superbly filmed by Frankenheimer, with multi-angles used to maximise the experience, while he also uses split screen sections to fully immerse us with the key characters. Two crash sequences are genuinely heart stopping, filmed with a clarity that makes us realise that people actually do die in this sport. While the sound work and editing is quite simply stunning.\r\n\r\nSee it on the biggest screen you can, and for home formats get the best possible disc available. 8/10"

The story does take quite a while to get going, but the three principals with the help of some wonderful orchestrations (Nelson Riddle at the helm) of \"Wandrin' Star\"; \"They Call the Wind Maria\" & \"I Talk to the Trees\" all deliver really rather well (if, perhaps not quite so tunefully by Marvin). The actors are having great fun amongst the rain, mud and poverty - and that fun can at times be quite contagious; there are some really enjoyable ensemble scenes/numbers too. The story is, however, strung out far too thinly over what seemed like an age and though there are some quite pithy one liners, the comedy is equally sparsely distributed throughout this all but three hour film.

Unfortunately, she has parent issues and a penchant for settling mundane problems in dubious ways.  \r\n\r\n“Blown Away” (1993) is a drama/thriller with some surprising softcore thrown in (and shouldn’t be confused with the 1994 theatrical film with Tommy Lee Jones and Jeff Bridges). I say “surprising” because I wasn’t expecting erotica in a made-for-TV crime drama featured on Roku. In that respect it’s similar to “Two Moon Junction” (1988) and “Embrace of the Vampire” (1995) except that this is a different genre (but not too different). Needless to say, if bits of softcore nudity and sex turn you off, I suggest staying away.\r\n\r\nIf you can roll with it, however, the Ontario ski resort locations offer a great setting for the drama and Eggert is easy on the eyes, not to mention Kathleen Robertson (Darla) and a couple peripherals. \r\n\r\nHaim is decent as the naïve coming-of-age protagonist, although what he does in a shady bar stretches credibility. Meanwhile Feldman is surprisingly convincing as the darker sibling. Haim and Feldman were of course known as The Two Coreys, real-life close friends who appeared in 9 movies together, including “The Lost Boys” (1987). Unfortunately, Haim lost his long struggle with drug addiction and died of pneumonia in 2010. Feldman later released an autobiography of their friendship in 2020 that exposed their sexual abuse as kids in the industry called “My Truth: The Rape of 2 Coreys.”  \r\n\r\nThe movie worked for me mostly due to the excellent setting and interesting cast, but there is some questionable acting and the story devolves into unbelievable melodrama in the third act.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes, and was shot at Talisman Mountain Resort in Kimberly, Ontario, as well as Pickering College in Newmarket, which is about a 45-minute drive southeast of the resort in the greater Toronto area. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

I don't think any supporting actor in an action film was as ever as good as Paxton in Aliens --going from cock-sure Marine to \"Game over man!\" defeatist is one of the funniest and honest parts in action movies. It made a great film even better by finally having someone be in full-on panic mode when things got very bad. \r\n\r\nContinuing into the 90s and beyond, Paxton alternated between big-budget blockbusters and small films, Paxton was always the most interesting thing on the screen no matter the role. \r\n\r\nIn the film noir world, Paxton was actually in three films that are clearly in the film noir tent. And they're all outstanding. In 1998, he was top billed in the rural noir A Simple Plan. In 2001, he directed and starred in Frailty. Both of those are top heavy with fantastic performances and we'll no doubt cover them in future articles. \r\n\r\nBut the one I wanted to highlight this week is One False Move. It's a crime film to be sure. But the story is driven along by people and feelings that motivate them. It was essentially the first lead role for Paxton and he knocks it out of the park. Instead of playing it straight, Paxton give a good-old-boy, off-kilter performance that fits perfectly with the telling of the story. \r\n\r\nInitially, Dale 'Hurricane' Dixon (Paxton) is seen through the eyes of big-city police as just a hick Arkansas cop trying to help the real police solve a crime. As the story unfolds his ego is crushed then his past comes back to haunt him. You can see the gears in his head turning in the simple man's head as things get more and more complicated. \r\n\r\nThe film intercuts between two stories. One of the amusing Hurricane and the LAPD cops, and the other the criminals on the lam quickly becoming more and more paranoid and unhinged. The crooks are played with gusto by pony-tailed Billy Bob Thornton (also the co-writer) and Michael Beach. Cynda Williams plays Fantasia-- the beautiful black woman that ties all the stories together. \r\n\r\nThe film was initially set to be a direct-to-video release but it turned out so well, it was sent to theaters to rave reviews. \r\n\r\n\r\nRoger Ebert wrote in 1992, \r\n\"On the very short list of great movies about violent criminals, One False Move deserves a place of honor, beside such different kinds of films as In Cold Blood, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Badlands, The Executioner's Song and At Close Range. It is a great film.\"\r\n\r\nWatching it last week, it still holds up. It's great to see a film from that era not inspired by the Tarantino tsunami of sound and pop culture that influenced all crime films a few years after. It's a quiet rural noir with a sense of dread in the silence. Unlike other noirs of the era leaning heavily on camera gymnastics and venetian-blind shadows, it's shot (by director Carl Franklin) in a straightforward way making the grisly violence more terrifying when scenes end short -- sometimes right before violence. Deliberately slow paced, the film drinks in every moment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI recommend you find One False Move. Then turn off your phone and watch it without distraction."

Funnily enough, the innuendo-ridden character names look better on paper than they do when mentioned on screen - as illustrated by Kenneth Connor's lead character \"Capt. S. Melly\" who, alongside his sergeant-major \"Bloomer\" (Windsor Davies) spend their time trying to keep the men and women from their platoon from getting into any hanky panky. Trousers are constantly up and down, knickers fly from flagpoles, there are even tunnels used in attempt to lift this from the comedy doldrums but unfortunately they just don't work. It's way too predictable and the innocent cheekiness of the earlier films has been replaced by a rather crass degree of smuttiness that just makes this a bit crude. Joan Sims tries hard to bring back some semblance of the old days, but by the end you really do realise just how much better Messrs. James/Hawtrey/Williams and Hattie Jacques actually were at delivering a light-hearted comedy with an hint of naughtiness. I'd just give this a miss, sorry."

But sparing time for it was the big decision I had made, knowing a film not for my age. Without a single bit of graphics they have managed it well to tell a story. The production was decent, but the story was too predictable with a below average jokes. I just wanted to clear the air that I was not bored of it, simply not my type of entertainment film, that's all.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the adult comedy, 'Ted' might have inspired by this, except it is a children's film. The actors were decent, because they did not get a challenging role. With a giant Ted in the title role, it should have been an adventure film. He's here to help the kid and I think his character did nothing big achievement rather boring writing of his character.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that's a man was inside the fur, so the stunts would have not cost too much if they had used a stunt artist. Because adding a couple of those scenes would have given a reason for the audience to cheer. The end was a loop, they kept it that way, in case of a sequel planned in the future. But I hope they won't make it, unless a very adventurous. Not recommended unless you plan to show it for your kids.\r\n\r\n3/10"

It stars John Payne, Preston Foster, Coleen Gray, Neville Brand, Jack Elam and Lee Van Cleef. Music is by Paul Sawtell and cinematography by George E. Diskant. Plot sees four robbers hold up an armoured truck and get away with over a million dollars. Sadly for everyday and ordinary Joe Rolfe (Payne), he's set up and accused of being involved in the robbery. But he wont go down without a fight, and promptly calls upon his dark half to seek out the actual culprits himself. \r\n\r\n\"In the police annals of Kansas City are written lurid chapters concerning the exploits of criminals apprehended and brought to punishment. But it is the purpose of this picture to expose the amazing operations of a man who conceived and executed a \"perfect\" crime, the true solution of which is \"not\" entered in \"any\" case history, and could well be entitled \"Kansas City Confidential\".\r\n\r\nProduced by Edward Small, Kansas City Confidential is believed to be the only film released out of Small's own Associated Players and Producers studio. Still, if you are going to only have one film on your studio résumé, you have to be thankful that it's a little cracker. More \"B\" movie grit than film noir flecked nastiness, Karlson's movie is lean, mean and structured with knowing skill by the director. From the tremendous tension fuelled opening of the heist planning and execution, through to the deadly payoff at the finale, film is awash with knuckle slappings, shifting identities and the turning of the protagonist's psychological make up. Were it not for one of \"those\" endings, and the telegraphing of optimism slightly shunting the pessimistic atmosphere out of the headlights, this would undoubtedly be far more revered and better known in film noir/crime movie circles. \r\n\r\nFirst thing to note of worth is the cast assembled for the picture. Payne was already leaving behind his formative acting years in family fare like Miracle On 34th Street and Footlight Serenade, reinventing himself as a dramatic actor in films such as The Crooked Way. He's a perfect fit for Joe Rolfe, an ex-con war veteran down on his luck, he has his every man qualities pummelled out of him by the police, so much so he has to turn bad to prove that he's good. The change is believable in Payne's hands, his face that of normality in the beginning, but latterly icy cold and untrustworthy. A trio of \"B\" movie stalwarts make up the thugs gallery, Jack Elam is sweaty and worm like, Lee Van Cleef is snake faced and pulsing bad attitude, while  Neville Brand exudes borderline psychotic menace. Unfortunately Preston Foster as the \"boss\" man is not altogether convincing, but in a film where characters are not always what they seem, this doesn't hurt the film. \r\n\r\nColeen Gray shows a nice pair of legs for the boys, but with Karlson not bothered about fleshing out the romantic and flirting aspects of her relationship with Payne, she exists only as a secondary cog between Payne and Foster's characters. This is no femme fatale character, sadly, no sir. Music is standard fare and Diskant's photography only fleetingly shows some noir flourishes. However, with two fists full of grit from which to punch, and some boldness in the narrative involving police brutality, Kansas City Confidential comes out as one of the better \"B\" ranked crime movies of the 50's. 8/10"

Luckily for him, the police can't press charges - all the robbers wore masks - and so he decides to track down the thugs and claim a share of the cash for himself. You get where this is going early on, but when you see Jack Elam and Lee Van Cleef on the cast list, you know that you are in for a bumpy ride. There are plenty of crosses and double-crosses as he and the gang (none of whom know the identity of their criminal mastermind) try to get to Mexico and to the loot. It's a good end-to-end action adventure, with a taut, eery score from Paul Sawtell adding much to the sinister lighting effects that give this film a much better than average sense of suspense."

It stars Matt Damon, Penélope Cruz, Henry Thomas & Lucas Black. Marty Stuart scores the music and Barry Markowitz photographs it. Plot finds Damon as John Grady Cole, a young cowboy who travels with his best friend, Lacey Rawlings, from Texas across the border into Mexico. It's a journey that sees acquaintances come and go, love blossom and the harshness of the world become all too real to such young eyes.\r\n\r\nA big financial disaster for Columbia Pictures and Miramax Films who lost nearly $40 million on the film. Serves them right I say, for Thornton's original cut was a long epic piece thought to be around three and a half hours in length. But good old Harvey Weinstein demanded drastic cuts to be made and Thornton had to trim it to just nearly two hours in running time. That's a lot of story gone astray, and boy does it show, no wonder Damon himself bitterly commented that to lose 35% of your movie ultimately leaves you with a completely different film. It's such a shame because although it's now a film chocked with flaws and flow problems, one can see that in its original cut there had to be at worst an involving rites-of-passage story.\r\n\r\nSo what are we left with? Well it's certainly not a donkey. It drips with period atmosphere and comes resplendent with a poetic beauty thanks to Markowitz's photography. Stuart's score too has the tone absolutely right, blending the old feel of the West with evocative arrangements for the more tender moments involving the protagonists: and there are tender moments, notably between Cole (Damon youthful but not really exuding a naivety for the age of the character) & Rawlings (Thomas effective and dominating his scenes). That the crucial relationship between Cole and Alejandra Villarreal (Cruz weak and lacking believability for the romantic strand) is barely formed can be laid at Weinstein's door. So too can the fact that a number of characters file in and out with blink and you miss them parts, sad when it's the likes of Robert Patrick and Sam Sheperd; and tragic in the case of Bruce Dern's judge; the latter of which is a crucial character in the final quarter but gets about three minutes screen time. Madness. Star of the movie is Black, who as young ruffian Blevins, manages to convey a deep sense of vulnerability. It's a critical role, one that affects the main character's lives, and thanks to Black's spirited performance we anxiously await what fate has in store for the lovable rogue.\r\n\r\nSo much good to sample, then, even if it feels like going out for a three course dinner and finding the main course is no longer available. It's hoped that one day we may get a directors cut from Thornton, only then you feel will All the Pretty Horses be revealed as a potential thoroughbred. 6/10"

        "content": "_**Unique, beautiful Western with excellent score, but gaping holes in the story**_\r\n\r\nReleased in 2000, \"All the Pretty Horses\" stars Matt Damon and Henry Thomas as two West Texas cowboys, John Grady Cole and Lacey Rawlins, who are weary of all the fenced-in land in 1949 and so head to Mexico for freer pastures. There they meet up with a foolish juvenile (Lucas Black) before coming to a huge ranch where Penelope Cruze plays the owner's daughter, Alejandra. Unfortunately, unexpected problems surface. Miriam Colon plays the girl's staunch aunt and ranch matriarch while Sam Shepard and Bruce Dern have (very) small roles.\r\n\r\nBilly Bob Thornton directed the movie based on Cormac McCarthy's novel and the original runtime was said to be around 3 hours and 12 minutes, but was cut at the insistence of distributer Harvey Weinstein to a mere 117 minutes (!). Similar circumstances forced Marlon Brando to cut his sole directed movie, 1961's \"One-Eyed Jacks,\" from 5 hours to half that time and it turned out to be a Western masterpiece, but \"All the Pretty Horses\" was cut TOO much. Even an additional 20 minutes would've helped immeasurably. \r\n\r\nAs it is, there are gaping holes in the story. For instance, there is little build-up to Cole's love affair with Alejandra. \"The Horse Whisperer\" (1998), by contrast, is an excellent example of proper romantic build-up. Other questions abound: What did Alejandra experience in her life that made her brazenly risk her honor? What (specifically) was the source of her deep contempt for her aunt, who seemed to be just looking out for her? Why does Alejandra's father stay on close terms with Cole even AFTER it's discovered he (supposedly) lied to him? What led up to Rawlins' suicidal confrontation with a prison heavy and the same with Cole's deadly tassel? Also, it's subtly revealed that Cole, Rawlins and Blevins (the kid) have very different views of the world, but they're never fleshed out.\r\n\r\nThe original Director's Cut has been called a masterpiece by those who've seen it, and a release of it has been looked into, but the original composer, Daniel Lanois, steadfastly refused to license his score (which, unusually, he owns) to any release of the film. If they can't work it out, then why not just use the excellent score by Marty Stuart, which is the one used in the cut-down theatrical/DVD version?\r\n\r\nAs far as locations go, it's great to have a Western actually shot in West Texas rather than supposedly taking place in Texas, but being shot in Arizona, etc. It was equally shot in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nAlthough \"All the Pretty Horses\" has a severely troubled post-production history, it's still worth catching DESPITE the holes in the story. It has magnificent cinematography and locations, formidable actors (Damon is perfect as the humble, respectable protagonist), a magnificent score/soundtrack, an epic tone and an unpredictable story. In short, it's a unique Western that not everyone's going to like because uniqueness polarizes opinion. It's not great simply because it was butchered in post-production, but it's still a quality film and, in many ways, a pleasure to behold.\r\n\r\nSome criticize it as soporific and that's true in the sense that it's not a rollicking Western, like 2001's \"American Outlaws,\" which plays like \"Indiana Jones goes West.\" \"All the Pretty Horses,\" by contrast, is a realistic Western drama with the tone of the aforementioned \"Horse Whisperer,\" but with periodic actions sequences. It's a refreshing change from the typical in-your-face, loud, CGI-laden, foul-mouthed, unreal movies we have constantly rammed at us; and, again, the music's great. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

Hunter is really only there for the eye candy, but Abbott is not at all bad as the manipulative Sheik and there is plenty of action as we head towards quite an ingenious ending. I recall enjoying this as a kid - though I could never have told you the name of it - and I still enjoyed it now."

Yet there’s something very fresh about Paul Solet’s movie, it’s deeply unsettling but emotionally complex, even gnawing away at our inner built capacities for empathy and sympathy.\r\n\r\nJordan Ladd plays the mother of the piece, hit with personal tragedy time and time again, her will is tested to the limit when a car crash strips her of her husband and renders the baby she is carrying as being a sure case of still born. But she’s determined to carry it to term, and when she literally wills the dead child alive, it responds in kind and becomes Grace, the miracle baby…\r\n\r\nWhat follows is the disintegration of Ladd’s character and of the key characters around her. Meditations on grief are heavy but richly so, as is the nods to post-natal depression. The horror elements are strong, as baby Grace shows a thirst for something other than milk, and the slow-burn approach favoured by Solet pays off with a final quarter of heartbreaking devilment. Cast are dandy, especially a very committed Ladd, while other tech credits keep the film very much in the upper echelons of this sub-genre of horror. 8.5/10"

        "content": "Mike Leigh's 1993 film NAKED is a drama on sexual relations -- how men hurt women, how some women accept that hurt out of low self-esteem and a desire to be wanted or supported. It is distinguished by its remarkably lifelike characters. Most of the film was worked out in improvisations for several months before shooting began. Leigh wanted his actors to create elaborate back stories for their characters, fully living inside of them so that when the cameras started rolling they would be completely convincing.\r\n\r\nAs the film opens, Johnny (David Thewlis) has to flee Manchester after a sexual encounter with a married woman turns into rape and she threatens to set her husband after him. Stealing a car, he heads to London to crash at his ex-girlfriend Louise (Lesley Sharp), gets involved with her flatmate Sophie (Katrin Cartlidge), and spends a couple of nights homeless in London. Interspliced with this are scenes of Jeremy, a rich real estate broker whose sexual conquests serve as an upper-class counterpart to Johnny's own. Naturally the viewer is led to wonder what will happen when these two men meet.\r\n\r\nSomething is wrong with Johnny, he answers anything said to him with a rambling torrent of words, a logorrhea that is a form of intellectual bullying; this deeply wounded man seems to feel the best defense against the cruelties of the world is a good offense. Only 27, Johnny is so wasted that he is taken for much older. In this, Thewlis's performance is one of the masterful screen portrayals of an eccentric or mentally ill person, like Dustin Hoffmann in RAIN MAN or Peter Sellers in BEING THERE.\r\n\r\nBut all of the characters here are memorable, and my thoughts have often gone back to them in the time since I saw this film. I do have reservations about the plot, inasmuch as the last scenes of the film (which were decided only late in the filmmaking process) too suddenly change the tone and may seem anticlimactic. Nonetheless, I would recommend this film and believe it a great one in spite of its undeniable flaws."

        "content": "Innocent? Prove it!  \r\n\r\n*Warning: Spoilers*\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry Of Fear is directed by Fritz Lang & is adapted for the screen by Seton I. Miller from the Graham Greene novel \"The Ministry Of Fear.\" It stars Ray Milland as Stephen Neale, an ex-insane asylum inmate who is released after a two year sentence for what was allegedly the \"mercy\" killing of his incurably ill wife. Upon his release Neale buys his train ticket to London but is drawn to a fête being held near the rail station. From here, after a bizarre encounter with a fortune teller and a go at a \"guess the weight of the cake\" booth, he is thrust into a world of espionage; a world that sees him now have the Nazis on his tail.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a ticking clock, the seconds counting down to midnight. Germanesque credits arrive on the screen, telling us of our principal players and film makers. A rear shot of a man sitting in a chair staring up at said clock, that man is Ray Milland as Stephen Neale and we immediately know that atmosphere will play a big part in this story. Things are further made interesting when a trio of interesting points suddenly leap out and force us the viewer to notice. Just what sort of film has its protagonist be released from a mental asylum at midnight? How come the rail station is open after midnight? And more importantly, what sort of fête is held at this time of night? You could easily be forgiven for thinking you have just stepped into The Twilight Zone some 14 years before it sprang from Rod Serling's brain!\r\n\r\nOf course this being a Fritz Lang film one shouldn't be surprised to find the piece heavy on atmosphere. Yet Lang apparently didn't have it all his own way on the movie, issues about the script and other technical matters apparently blighted the production. But be that as it may, this is undeniably a Lang movie, even if one or two itches stop it from becoming a genuine film noir classic to rival that other well known Greene adaptation that followed four years later. It's a fair point critics saying that the cheap studio sets don't harm the movie, because they don't really. But genre fans surely can't help thinking just how great this could have been with actual location work involved. The main issue is the ending which, without providing spoilers for the readers, is poor in relation to what had preceded it in terms of mood and intelligence. It's all too elementary and a resort to what they obviously deemed was a crowd pleasing formula. Tightness of plot gives way to action-packeroo, and it doesn't sit quite right. I like to think it's here where Lang had the most objection?\r\n\r\nStill, there's so much to admire and enjoy here, not least Milland's excellent performance as the innocent man having a hard time convincing any officials that he's done nothing wrong. He in turn is backed up by the pretty and hard looking Hilary Brooke, who along with Dan Duryea in a small but pivotal role, puts a bit of a sinister film noir sheen on things. Then there is the near expressionistic feel to the piece, with a number of scenes being truly memorable. The whole fête sequence, with snatches of silence, is a classy bit of disquieting cinema. Or a blind mans walking stick tapping its way thru the rail station steam that carries a sense of foreboding that harks to the Universal Monster classics from the previous decade. There's even real beauty too, check out the camera work at the asylum, sumptuous! With mystery, intrigue, melodrama, Nazis, a cake and a huge pair of scissors, Ministry Of Fear is not to be missed by the classic movie fan. 8/10"

On his way back to London he stops off at a village fête where he guesses the weight of a cake correctly - and so has to lug it back on the train with him. When he shares it with a fellow passenger who proceeds to steal the thing, he guesses that there is more to it than just sponge and jam! His subsequent investigations lead him into the midst of a Nazi spy ring which he tries to thwart. Fritz Lang delivers quite a gripping story which Milland holds largely en seul - with a little help from Marjorie Reynolds as \"Carla\" - and there is just about enough suspense, and guesswork from us required, to sustain it for an hour and a half."

Helped enormously by director Henry Hathaway shooting the whole picture in New York, Kiss Of Death is also notable for being the searing debut of Richard Widmark. With no intention of soft soaping the story, the makers cunningly lure us viewers onto the seamy New York streets. Thus with the New York locations as expertly used as they are by Hathaway, Kiss Of Death attains a documentary style similar to other notable genre pictures like Call Northside 777 (also Hathaway).\r\n\r\nNarrating the picture is Nettie (Coleen Gray in her first credited role), the second wife of Nick Bianco (Victor Mature). Telling of his rough and troubled life, we learn that Bianco was part of a gang who was caught during a jewelry robbery over the Christmas holiday. Lied to by his lawyer, Bianco learns during his prison term that his first wife has killed herself and that his darling two girls have been packed off to an orphanage. Fretting and desperate to see his girls, Bianco makes a deal with Assistant District Attorney Louis D'Angelo (Brian Donlevy), where in exchange for is parole, he will rat out his old gang buddies. D'Angelo is mostly concerned with one man tho, sadistic murderer and boss, Tommy Udo (Widmark). Bianco must pal up to Udo and hope that he doesn't get found out, for if he does, Udo is sure to enact psychotic retribution on Nick and all those close to him.\r\n\r\nMature gives one of his finest shows as the pained Bianco forced to squeal, Gray as his second wife is sedate and effective and Donlevy as the crusading Assistant D.A. with a heart is as reliable as he always is. But all are playing second fiddle to Widmark, ferocious stare, dirty laugh and an unnerving falsetto voice, it announced Widmark to the cinematic world, garnered him a contract with Twentieth Century Fox and he never looked back afterwards. Some of his scenes are just mesmerising, including one that is as shocking as it is a lesson in villainy. Taut and tight scripting from the Hecht/Lederer partnership, with rounded characters and a sensible plot, Kiss Of Death is not to be missed by the Crime/Noir genre/style fan. 8.5/10"

The look is supplemented considerably by Tahouri's edgy pulse like musical score, while the Art Deco design of the Riverview is a splendid accompaniment to dark deeds unfolding.\r\n\r\nAs a story we are served up standard fare, the insertion of twisters and linear jumps not really lifting it out of its predictable trajectory. Which is a shame, because performances are solid and Merkin obviously has love for noir as a film making style. The resolution is expected but handled well enough to pay off the patient, but as a whole Across the Hall just about rises above average, but really this is more down to style than substance. 6/10"

No brave, honourable Samurai this time, but an elderly foundry-owner who is paranoid about the potential impact of nuclear war on his family. To this end, he is determined to sell up and relocate his family to Brazil. The family don't fancy this idea much and try to have him certified. What ensues is a battle of wills, priorities and personalities set against a traditional set of Japanese family structures and values. Viewed, largely, from the perspective of independent arbiter \"Dr. Harada\" (Takashi Shimura) who has been drafted in to help settle the matter amicably; we visit the perfectly valid (though frequently selfish) approaches taken by both Mifune and his family - who have plenty of scores to settle amongst themselves - as the film tries to establish the best course of action to satisfy both parties. There is quite an interesting scene mid-way through when at the height of their dispute, the old man returns to the court armed with bottles of pop which he has bought for his family to help combat the unrelenting heat, indicating that he clearly still cares greatly for his family, even though they are at loggerheads... and for me, that rather sums the whole thing up - there isn't necessarily a right or wrong solution; it's about individuality and choice but ultimately the happiness of others; and Mifune is great. I found the last fifteen minutes quite sad, perhaps building on the old adage about families and money. Japan, for a good while, struggled to reconcile itself to the realities of a post-Hiroshima threat, so from an observer some 6,000 miles away it can be hard to understand just how viscerally the danger of repetition was taken by many - this film is a thought provoking, emotional - and, at times humorous, glimpse into that fear."

I love it when a film delivers a lot more than I expected, which is what you get here.  Rutger Hauer and Joan Chen are the primary players on a team of roving 'athletes' who play a brutal game involving two sides, each of which is attempting to win by being the first to spike the skull of a dog on the opposing team's post (don't ask - the origin of this 'sport' is never revealed).  The winning team gets room and board, and maybe a cut of the betting.  Think of it as a variation of baseball's farm system and minor leagues.  Sully, Rutger's character, reached the 'major leagues' before the film begins, but due to poor judgement in choosing his bed partners, was cast all the way down to the bottom, and he's trying to make it back.  The teams that get to the top are allowed to commingle with this future society's one percenters who hold all the wealth and power.  They also get a vicarious thrill watching their 'sports heroes' bleed playing the game, hence the title.\r\n\r\nThe film is well paced but sparse, you get to learn just enough to understand what's happening and why.  Because of the context in which it is portrayed, it seems to never get dated. Almost no romantic moments, but violence?  Oh, yeah. If for no other reason, the film's ending scene where Sully instructs Kidda (Joan Chen's character) what her next actions should be, elevates this above most other films in the genre.  Let me put it this way - I gladly re-watch this one every chance I get.  My vote - 4 and 1/2 stars."

The Blue Gardenia of the title is a nightclub, one where Nat King Cole no less, sings the title song. However, it's the local newspaper that is the key element of the story, the place of work of ace journalist Casey Mayo (Conte), who gets in deep with the story and of course that means Norah as well. \r\n\r\nThere's some sparky dialogue as the story ticks away, with Sothern (sadly underused) wonderfully waspish, the murder mystery element remains strong enough, while there's dark at work as well (Burr is effectively on a mission to date rape). However, the pairing of Lang and Musuraca should be a dream team, but although there's the odd flash of noir visualisations during night sequences, you can't help but lament more wasn't provided for Musuraca to weave his magic. \r\n\r\nA good show from the cast helps ease the pain of the script's inadequacies, especially as regards the not very clever final revelations. So all in all, it's more a case of a mystery melodrama with noir touches than anything thrilling, and really it's one for Lang fans to tick off their to see lists, not to be visited again. 6.5/10"

Richard O'Brien plays the tormented lord of the manor while Mary Scheer appears as his dubious wife. Heather Hopper is on hand as their cute niece, the poster child for catalepsy. \r\n\r\n“Elvira’s Haunted Hills” (2001) is the follow-up to “Elvira, Mistress of the Dark” (1988), the latter of which was a fun flick but failed at the box office due to its main distributing company going under just before it was scheduled to be released (it was supposed to show at 2500 theaters, but only made it to 500). Cassandra couldn’t get studio funding for this prequel and so she & her then-husband put up $1 million with an additional $500,000 from relatives. As such, this movie cost 6 times LESS than the previous one from 13 years earlier (factoring in inflation).   \r\n\r\nWhile there’s a 13 year gap between these two films and Cassandra was 49 years-old during shooting, you wouldn’t know it by her fit form & all-around animated beauty. Another plus is the authentic Transylvania locations with a real castle (although the indoor scenes were obviously shot on studio sets).\r\n\r\nDespite the gross lack of funds compared to the prior movie, this one proves to be colorful and entertaining if you appreciate the eye-rolling goofy humor associated with Elvira. While the former flick is technically better due to having way more funds to work with, I like this one more as far as all-around entertainment goes. I suppose it’s because I favor the setting, which parodies 60’s horror flicks, like “The Pit and the Pendulum” (1961), “The Terror” (1963) and “Dracula, Prince of Darkness” (1966). It recalls horror send-ups “The Fearless Vampire Killers” (1967) and “Young Frankenstein” (1974), but I actually prefer this one despite the much lower budget and lack of ‘stars.’    \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in Transylvania, Romania, with studio work done in Bucharest.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

Which would be a mistake.\r\n\r\nBoth films were made around the same time. I Wake Up Screaming, however, is much closer to being a true film noir. That's thanks to some fantastic stylistic camerawork (low angles, dark shadowy corners, shadows of Venetian blinds, low lit closeups and so on) and a complicated plot made even more twisty with flashbacks. The Maltese Falcon, on the other hand, is shot mostly like a '30s drawing room mystery (true, there are two fantastic shots: Sydney Greenstreet shot from the floor to look like a grotesque giant; and Mary Astor taking the elevator to hell with the shadows of the bars marking her face). But I Wake Up Screaming is loaded with them. It's one of the best looking film noir from the classic era. But it's not just the film's look that makes it noir. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Huston famously said he used Hammett's book as the Maltese Falcon's script. In other words, he didn't try to change it. Therefore, the film ends up being the truest version of Dashiell Hammett's story.\r\n\r\nI Wake Up Screaming came about much differently. It's is based on a novel by one of best (and sadly now forgotten) pulp writers Steve Fisher. It's a Hollywood story about an up-and-coming movie star that dies mysteriously – and the people obsessed with the crime and the beautiful victim. More than likely, because of the film's limited budget the story was moved to New York City. The glamorous – and numerous locations – in southern California from the novel were whittled down to a few. Now instead you had a movie with only a few locations – all that would be shot in sets at Fox in LA --except for a few second unit pickup shots. The limited amount of locations possibly made the film unintentionally claustrophobic.  But what the film makers didn't change was the fact the the film was based on hardboiled pulp. A clue that that's true is a shot of Black Mask Magazine displayed in one scene.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack Mask Magazine makes its only appearance in a film noir.\r\nBlack Mask Magazine, for those who don't know, published stories from many of the greats including Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Steve Fisher, Cornell Woorich and Erle Stanley Gardner. Film noir (and clearly this film) was inspired in part by the magazine that was edited in it's prominence by Cap' Joseph Shaw. I Wake Up Screaming's director H. Bruce Humberstone and producer Milton Sperling never made a noir before (obviously, since it was one of the first) but also never made one after this. They did, in fact, mold what was to be film noir with this early noir movie. And they did it, in my opinion, based on hardboiled crime pulps. Extraordinary when you think about it. And when you look at all the sunny movies being released by 20th Century Fox at the time.\r\n\r\nI think because it's from 20th Century Fox (not known for their crime films like the WB) you'll see and hear a few things that remind you of the studios normal fare. There are a few light comic moments that should have been excised from the film. The scene at the public pool is also unnecessary. I get it. They had to have show Grable's stems and Mature shirtless. But it's silly. And I'd rather not think of the germs in an all-night New York City public swimming pool. There isn't enough chlorine in the world to clean a pool like that.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also not quite right. It's is a constant barrage of Somewhere Over the Rainbow and Alfred Newman's Street Scene. It's quite annoying. Street Scene is 20th Century Fox's theme for New York. It was used in a number of noir including: Cry of the City, The Dark Corner, Where the Sidewalk Ends, and Kiss of Death. Somewhere Over the Rainbow should only be in one movie. Street Scene is something I usually like but man, they use it a lot. The rest of the soundtrack is hit and miss.\r\n\r\nSome notable changes does make you think that the studio wanted a lighter-toned film. After the film was made, the movie's title was changed to Hot Spot (as in a hot-spot nightclub). Early promotional material and even some reviews (Variety noted: “Hot Spot may suggest a nightclub background, but such scenes are only incidental.”) use the newer, weaker title. The title was changed back from Hot Spot to I Wake Up Screaming just before it's release thanks to the cast demanding they use the film's original moniker. Smart move. I Wake Up Screaming is one of the best titles for a film noir.\r\n\r\nThe 2006 DVD has a deleted scene showing Grable singing a song at her job selling sheet music at a department store. The clip has no place in the film and it's now where it should be (as an interesting extra, but not part of the film).\r\n\r\nBetty Grable hadn't yet become America's top pinup. She's out of place in noir but does a fine job in this. Obviously she'd have much better success at other types of films in the future, but she holds her own.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast does too.\r\n\r\nVictor Mature is solid as he always is. Unfortunately, like his other starring roles in film noir, he's overshadowed by the villain.\r\n\r\nThis time it's Laird Cregar (This Gun for Hire, Hangover Square, The Lodger) who's steals the spotlight from Mature.  He's an outstanding film actor despite not yet even 30 years old. Cregar dominates the film and is the most memorable actor in the movie. According to the excellent DVD commentary by Eddie Muller, Steve Fisher named Cregar's character in the book Cornell after fellow pulp writer and friend Cornell Woolrich. Brilliant oddball Woolrich was a skinny ginger. Casting Cregar as Mature's physical equal (they were both big and about the same height) makes the conflict between the two believable. Cregar is kind of a fun house mirror version of Mature. I wish they played up the scene where Mature wakes up to see 300-pound Cragar sitting in his bedroom watching him. It's very creepy and would cause most to scream if they were in the same situation.\r\n\r\nThird-billed Carole Landis (teamed with Mature after appearing together before in One Million B.C.) has a key but ultimately forgettable role. Her demise in the film mirrors the actresses limited success and suicide in real life.  Landis and Grable do look like sisters, though.\r\n\r\nSome key noir faces in supporting roles: Elisha Cook, Jr. He appeared in Stranger on the Third Floor a year before and apparently was shooting his part in The Maltese Falcon at the same time as I Wake Up Screaming! Keen eyes will spot Charles Lane as a florist; Night Editor William Gargan; and gum-snapping working girl Iris Adrian plays Grable's work friend (in the deleted scene on the DVD.)\r\n\r\nAt The Back Alley, arguments were made not that long ago about the noir-ness of The Maltese Falcon. But those arguments couldn't be made for I Wake Up Screaming. Despite it's sometimes comic tone and strange soundtrack it's a film noir."

        "content": "They've got more wolves in New York than they've got in Siberia. \r\n\r\nI Wake Up Screaming is one of the early entries in the film noir cycle that lays down noirish detective conventions. The kicker is similar to that of \"Stranger On The Third Floor (1940)\", that of the chief suspect turning detective to try and prove innocence. Directed by Fox contract director H. Bruce Humberstone, the screenplay is by Dwight Taylor who adapts from Steve Fisher's novel of the same name. It stars Betty Grable (excellent in a rare dramatic role), Victor Mature, Carole Landis, Laird Cregar, William Gargan & Elisha Cook Jr. Picture is filmed as if in New York City, but although it's actually listed as the real location on other sources, it's more than likely just expert set construction. Edward Cronjager (Canyon Passage/Desert Fury) takes up cinematography duties.\r\n\r\nThe plot centers around cocky promoter Frankie \"Botticelli\" Christopher (Mature) who is accused of the murder of Vicky Lynn (Landis), a young actress he \"discovered\" as a waitress while out with his friends. Teaming up with Vicky's level headed sister Jill (Grable), Frankie finds the heat is on and it's getting hotter as the police, led by brooding heavy Ed Cornell (Cregar), are determined to put him in the electric chair, or \"Hot Spot\" (the film's original working title and a title held for the UK release of the film). Told in alternating flashbacks, nothing is ever quite what it seems, so with dark motives looming and deep suspicion enveloping our protagonists, the question is, just who will wake up screaming?. It starts out rather briskly, jaunty music opens the piece up and one gets the feeling that this is very much going to be a standard Betty Grable picture. In fact when you consider that snatches of \"Over The Rainbow\" are used at frequent points in the movie, the makers have to be applauded for ultimately achieving the murky end product that \"I Wake Up Screaming\" becomes. There's very little \"light\" in the piece, what bright scenes there are serve as snippets of hope for our intrepid detectives, but outside of that it's deep shadows & dark interiors, perfectly given the high contrast treatment by the talented Cronjager.\r\n\r\nThis is very much Cregar's movie. A fine character actor before his sad and premature death, he had a hulking presence that dominated film if given the material to work with. Here he gets a role to really unnerve the audience with. For although the character is watered down from the source novel, his Ed Cornell (apparently based on pulp novelist Cornell Woolrich) is creepy yet oddly garners sympathy too. Most of the best scenes involve the big man, I mean not many actors could dwarf Mature the way that Cregar does here, but the film is all the better for it as the characters personas are unfolded in front of the audience. It helps of course that Humberstone & Cronjager get the best out of Cregar's shiftiness, semi-cloaking his face with window blind shadows or using his body shadow to act as another character bearing down on the latest person to be on the receiving end of his penetrative questions. While one sequence as Frankie sweatily wakes from a feverish nightmare will linger in the conscious as much as Cregar effectively lingers in the movie.\r\n\r\nWith devilish twists and turns and a genuinely hard to figure out \"who done it\" structure, \"I Wake Up Screaming\" is very much an essential movie for the Noir/Crime movie fan. And of course for those wishing to see just why Laird Cregar was so highly regarded. 8/10"

It stars Richard Todd, Anne Baxter, Herbert Lom and Faith Brook. Music is scored by Matyas Seiber, with additional guitar by Julian Bream, and cinematography by Erwin Hillier.\r\n\r\nA man shows up at Kimberley Prescott's Spanish villa claiming to be her brother. Trouble is is that her brother, Ward Prescott, died in a car accident a year ago...\r\n\r\nThe core formula for Chase a Crooked Shadow has been well mined over the years, only recently I myself viewed the quite excellent Hammer Films Production of Paranoiac, which treads the same ground as Anderson's movie, but there's a filmic style here that adds further atmosphere to the moody mysterious tone of the narrative. Thus, in spite of the absurdities and stretching of credulity, this is well worth seeking out.\r\n\r\nAnderson carefully builds the suspense, ensuring that what we think we know may in fact not be the case. The twists and jolts are deftly handled and the finale is a delightful bolt from the blue. Along the way we are treated to a noirish canvas, where even though the film is shot on location on the Costa Brava, there's a Gothic sheen pretty much every where you look. The interior of the villa is complete with Grandfather clock, iron gate doors, odd light shades, statuettes and one of those staircases with balustrade, all of which is given maximum shadow effects by Hillier. The outside courtyard also serves the uneasy mood well, as does the stone beach house at the bottom of the hill, it should be idyllic, but fret and discord dwell there as well.\r\n\r\nCast are most effective, some have called Todd too wooden, but he needs to be restrained here, he is after all playing the character's cards close to his chest. Baxter, looking positively lovely, handles the mental disintegration process with great skill, Brook really exudes a Mrs. Danvers like menace purely with cold dialogue delivery and an icy stare, while Lom has authoritative presence as the police man being pulled both ways of the mystery. Top performers doing justice to a fine mystery story that is in turn offering some visual pleasures too. 7.5/10"

As the film opens, it is 1942 and the young Russian sailor Anatoly is forced by the Germans to shoot his captain Tikhon. Left for dead, Anatoly washes up on the shore of an island where a monastery is located. He spends the next three decades among the monks trying to atone for the killing of his friend and shipmate. Eventually, though he considers himself the lowest of the low, Anatoly is granted clairvoyance and the ability to work miracles. A steady stream of visitors comes to the island to seek his help.\r\n\r\nBut Anatoly is a certain kind of saint specific to the Russian tradition, the holy fool. He does things that make no sense to his fellow monks, to the point they think he's insane, but eventually everything he does is revealed to communicate some key spiritual point. Between ministering to the outsiders who visit him and dealing with his exasperated brethren, Anatoly gets no rest.\r\n\r\nThe film is beautiful in a way. The plot is engaging enough, and for audiences outside Russia (as well as many Russians who grew up under Communism) this is an informative presentation of the realities of Orthodox monastic life. The makeup effects are excellent -- Pyotr Mamonov doesn't look this decrepit in real-life, but on the screen he really is convincing as a starets who has spent decades in an unforgiving environment.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I found <i>Ostrov</i> rather too heavy-handed, seeming at best sappy and at worst outright propaganda for a certain kind of contemporary Russian Orthodoxy that doesn't represent the faith entirely well. When one thinks of Russian Orthodoxy in cinema, one is tempted to draw comparisons with Andrei Tarkovsky, but even when Tarkovsky wasn't directly using Orthodox themes, he still communicated Christian truths more powerfully than anything in this film (think of the climax of Tarkovsky's <i>Stalker</i> or the ending of <i>Offret</i>). Thus, all in all, <i>Ostrov</i> is entertaining but not terribly deep."

With the help of a suitably obsequious character of Thomas Cromwell (John Calicos), the internecine and fickle politics of Henry VIII's court is laid bare for us to watch. Perhaps Burton is a bit overly theatrical at times, but there is a smouldering chemistry between the two; the look of the film is great with superb location and costume detail too. Towards the end you almost begin to feel sorry for the poor woman who played the game for all it was worth, but the King's caprices and her inability to have a son wrote her death warrant for her.

That's right, this film is not an adaptation of any book, for the first time in the series it is an original screenplay. But the director was retained for the fifth time and that's a plus point here. Particularly who can understand not just this one film, but the whole series to take it on the right path. There is also lies some weakness that it's not getting better as it should be, but I would say it's the writing that did not impress me.\r\n\r\nThis is the half way mark and another film in the series that's not so good, but counting it as an individual, definitely it is a better one. I expected this film after the previous one was not up to its previous one, but I must say I'm slightly disappointed. It is enjoyable, as a television film and its production quality was undeniably great, but I think my over anticipation is what barred me from having a good time with it. I am not blaming the story, but the scenes which were not strong enough. The positives were you can't predict them, and what's more important than that in a detective story.\r\n\r\nIt opened with a shootout and Jesse got injured, though there's no serious. Now he has a case to pursue, but not official and his chief warns him going after certain person. Jesse also got enquired by an Internal Affair for him involving in the recent shootouts which is above normal. Besides, a mother came afar to him requesting to investigate her baby went missing seven years ago. Among the cases, the narration splits, but holds the suspense till the final act. There's no big twist, but both the cases come to end with Jesse's unique way of dealing.\r\n\r\n> \"The information's out there. All you've to do is let it in.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the tale is about to conclude, there comes a big blow to him and his future hangs. An interesting ending, maybe a turning point in the series like the season one ends here and the season two is about to commence. If it was a television series, this is where the split happens between the seasons. The Jesse's walk out of the station at the final scene brings a new perspective. A bit emotional, if you are a Jesse Stone fan.\r\n\r\nThe last two films were average compared to the earlier ones, so this change might refresh in the series going forward. It should be, otherwise I might lose interest in the series. This film is not bad, but after the fine developments in the mid part which was hyped, did not stand up to the expectations once the revelation came. There was no big expansion in the cast, but like usual some of the new ones, those who came only for this film had made some decent contribution. Like Jessica Hecht was the only known person to me who have made into it. And the rest of the cast including Selleck was great as usual.\r\n\r\nJesse still remains dominated, but kind of losing strength while other characters around him gaining the momentum in their small part. Because he's the same from the first film, though needs some upgrade like nothing for the additional, but feeding with what he's good at. I mean, he's a badass and a daring character, but lately his parts were not appealing enough as what he's known for. On the other hand, he's just a small town cop; his work is under a limit and that kind of big excuse we definitely don't want. Hope it will not be the case for the next one.\r\n\r\nI thought I was a Jesse Stone franchise fan after the first two films, but I'm not sure now, the only next couple of films would decide that. So I'm eager for the next sequel. Talking about this installment, I find it above average, but for being a television film and a film series, you can't blame entirely. Because like I said in the earlier review, the ups and downs are part of a film franchise and sometimes they're on purposely done to balance the good and bad side of the story and characters. Like a wheel it has to come up sooner or later, that means the next one in the series is very crucial. It's not the cast or the crew, but the story should be at its best. I hope it all comes back to the normal there. So I meet you there.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

Their mission is to rescue a kidnapped harem of women. William Smith is on hand as a heavy.\r\n\r\n\"Hell Comes to Frogtown\" (1988) is a sci-fi/fantasy adult comedy that mixes the first two Planet of the Apes movies (or the Mad Max flicks) with frog people and a comedic vibe. Former pro-wrestler Piper makes for a likable, amusing protagonist while Sandahl is the same in the feminine department, although she lost the curvy appeal she had when she was in her physical prime in “Conan the Barbarian” (1982). She’s too thin here, but still attractive.   \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day this is an entertaining throwaway flick that fills the bill when you’re in the mode for something light and goofy. While the movie flirts with raunch, it has a good heart. You like the two protagonists and enjoy their antics together; and the ending is heartwarming. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot in Southern Cal (Indian Dunes, Valencia; Kaiser Steel Mill, Fontana; Lincoln Foundry, Vernon; and Vasquez Rocks, Agua Dulce).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

They save a girl in a church and accidentally break a vile of zombie blood and so begins the search for a replacement.\r\nWhich could be OK if most of the film wasn't just watching TV adds or these imbeciles strolling though malls.

Anyway, the plot centres around Wayne's \"Sheriff Higgins\" who whilst pursuing bank robbers shoots his friend - well, at least that's what he thinks... We know differently, and as he gradually gets over his grief, he starts to pick up the pieces and sets out to sort out the baddies. It's all pretty run of the mill stuff for the star, with Lucile Browne adding the glamour and a slightly flat Gabby Hayes not quite firing on all cylinders either. This film is no worse than many of the others Wayne was making at the time, and once it gets going it's entertaining enough - it's just really sloppily produced and edited and could never be described as anyone's finest work!"

        "content": "_**Once notorious, now surreal, cornball and amusing**_\r\n\r\nIn 1881 New Mexico, newly-appointed Sheriff Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) is upset after Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel) comes to Lincoln and essentially steals his good friend, Doc Holliday (Walter Huston). After Billy is wounded, Doc drops him off with his girlfriend, Rio (Jane Russell). While she has reason to hate Billy, the opposite happens. Eventually the four are forced to team-up to escape some hostile Mescaleros before having a showdown. \r\n\r\nShot in late 1940 and early 1941, “The Outlaw” was directed by the exceptional Howard Hughes with uncredited assist from Howard Hawks and Jules Furthman. It wasn’t released until 1943 due to censorship problems that required cuts & revisions and more widely rereleased in 1946-47. Due to the ballyhoo over it being \"offensive to decency\" it ended up setting records almost everywhere it was shown. \r\n\r\nThe uproar was apparently over sultry Jane Russell, who got the role after a nationwide search by Hughes for a busty actress, and mostly the sexual innuendo between her character and Billy the Kid. Ironically, when it was reissued to theaters in 1976 it was given a ‘G’ rating. Speaking of Jane’s buxomness, Hughes & his aircraft engineers designed a special cantilevered bra to enhance her bust, but she admitted in her 1988 autobiography that she secretly never wore it because it was too uncomfortable, yet this flick was the reason the famous bra was designed.\r\n\r\nIgnoring the hullabaloo, what about the movie itself? Is it a worthy Western? Yes and no. Yes, because of Walter Huston’s charismatic performance as Doc Holliday and Jane’s pouty beauty (she looks like the sister Elvis never had). The movie can be entertaining if you acclimate to its corny surrealism, but the way the characters shift from mortal enemies to bosom buddies is jarring, yet amusing if you can roll with it. Meanwhile Thomas Mitchell is noticeably too old to play the role of Pat Garrett (who was only 31 in real-life when Billy was shot).\r\n\r\nIt’s worth checking out for the reasons noted, but don’t expect the greatness of early Westerns like “Stagecoach” (1939), “Buffalo Bill” (1944) and “Duel in the Sun” (1946).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 56 minutes, but there are also shorter versions, not to mentioned colorized ones, which I recommend unless you don’t mind B&W. It was shot at Red Rock Canyon State Park, Cantil, California, with studio work done in Los Angeles and second unit work done in New Mexico and Arizona (Tuba City & Yuma). \r\n\r\nGRADE: C"

She overcomes problems I won’t go into and risk giving details away, but suffice to say you should really end up rooting for her.\r\n\r\nMy only problem with the movie is the ending. I felt the book had the perfect ending, and the movie went a different way. Don’t get me wrong; if I hadn’t read the book, I am sure I would have been a-okay with the movie ending. I just thought the book nailed it. But movies and books have different story arcs sometimes, and it wouldn’t stop me from watching Circle of Friends again if the opportunity comes along.

        "content": "An Academy Awards Best Picture nominee, this is a very good film that, despite its occasional experimentation and evident striving for greatness, doesn't quite reach the mark it hopes to. Nonetheless, it's unmistakably high quality and remains very watchable, enduringly appealing, and, in places, impressive.\r\n\r\nThe big glaring shortcomings are the experimental moments - which don't work and are distracting - and the fact that Miss Hayes is, much of the time, given over-ripe, unnaturally worded and stagy sounding dialogue to speak - and so much of the time, despite that she does give a fine, clearly talented performance, she does so in stage-performer mode and with \"impress them with my craft\" line delivery, rather than in the much more subtle and truly naturalistic way that's right for movie acting. I'm not faulting Miss Hayes' performance, instead am opining that she gives a stage star's version of subtle movie acting, rather than a movie actor's version thereof.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, all the stagily worded dialogue was given only to Miss Hayes to speak. Other characters are given infinitely more real and believable sounding dialogue. Perhaps Paramount expressly wanted to capitalize on Miss Hayes' stature and deserved reputation as one of the greatest stage stars of her time, therefore ordered script writers to \"pour it on thick\" when it came to lines for her to speak.\r\n\r\nAn additional shortcoming of this film, for me, has always been that I never have found Cooper and Hayes to seem like a credible couple; his chemistry with and towards her seems 100% natural and believable, though her interactions with him always feel, to me, like she's performing, rather than it being convincingly real life-like. I don't mean to sound like I'm faulting Miss Hayes, as she was, as we know, tremendously gifted. Her performance in this movie feels, to me, like it would have been spot-on on the stage. Another issue is that Miss Hayes has always struck me as miscast in this, as she seems neither remotely British nor the irresistible beauty that characters express to one another that she is.\r\n\r\nVery strong points of the movie are the cinematography (winner of the Best Cinematography Oscar), which is superb throughout, particularly throughout the impressive and memorable roughly four minutes exodus to Milan montage; it's outstanding. Too, the sets (nominated for the Best Art Direction Oscar) are marvelous. Also the performances by Cooper, Adolphe Menjou (as Cooper's surgeon best friend Rinaldi), Jack La Rue (as the priest), and Mary Philips (as Catherine's nurse best friend Fergie) are each perfect and wonderful.\r\n\r\nDefinitely make sure that it's the beautiful near pristine KINO release of this film that you watch, and not one of the degraded, too often butchered, public domain releases. On the KINO version (which is 89 minutes in length), the picture and sound is near perfect, and you'll readily be able to fully appreciate the visual glory of this film.\r\n\r\nThis is a movie that, despite my having the stated \"issues\" with it - and heretofore I failed to also mention its at times shameless ultra-melodrama (the letter-writing scene, or the final scene, anyone?) - I nonetheless always very much enjoy watching it, whenever I periodically do, and am always readily able to appreciate the things about it that are terrific. I consider this a very good film, and appreciate and enjoy it as such. I find myself feeling drawn to watch this again a time or two just about every year - and usually do.\r\n\r\nFYI: This review is also presented as a post on TMDb's **AFtA** message board, if wishing to comment/discuss."

It could certainly be doing with some additional wattage - but even so, the film is stylish to look at, and the performances from Boyer, Gurie, Gene Lockhart and Alan Hale as a sort of prophetic grandfather kind of character add a quite a lot of richness to Henri La Barthe's pretty nondescript, very dialogue heavy, 1931 novel. It's certainly worth a watch if not for the story, then for the performances."

Based on the Charlotte Brontë novel of the same name, it stars Orson Welles, Joan Fontaine and Peggy Ann Garner. Music is scored by Bernard Herrmann and George Barnes is the cinematographer.\r\n\r\nAfter a harsh and eye opening childhood, orphan Jane Eyre gains employment at Thornfield Hall as governess to the young ward of Edward Rochester. A Difference in class and life outlook, Jane and Rochester are by definition polar opposites, but a bond exists, a bond that surely can't conquer the mysteries of Rochester the man, and the secret of his estate - can it?\r\n\r\nStevenson's version of the often filmed Jane Eyre has been pored over numerous times before, the constant question that arises is that of just how much input and work did Orson Welles have in the production? Knowing what we now know of Welles' 40s output, Jane Eyre undeniably has the Wellesian stamp all over it, with Fontaine herself quoted as saying the big man was often found behind the camera. This is not to decry Stevenson in any way, he himself would carve out a good career in directing further down the line, but this take on Brontë's famous novel shines because of Welles' presence in front and behind the camera.\r\n\r\nWith that comes one of only two quibbles with the film as a whole, namely it's Welles' portrayal of Rochester that dominates the film, and not that of Fontaine's Eyre. Which is quite staggering considering he doesn't enter the fray until 34 minutes into ty epic. The other problem, naturally, is that with a running time of just over an hour and thirty five minutes, it was never going to be a detailed adaptation of the novel. However, what exists is still an excellent mounted production, a film pulsing with aggressive atmospherics and simmering emotional passions.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued that the opposing acting styles of Fontaine and Welles are a distraction, I don't see it that way at all, as one of classic cinemas greatest voices emotionally spars with one of its most beautiful faces, this is monochrome gold dust. In mind of the difference of characters as written on the page, it actually comes off as inspired casting. With the production that surrounds them perfectly in keeping with the characters' state of mind.\r\n\r\nThe look is assuredly what would become known as film noir, with George Barnes' (Rebecca/Spellbound/Force of Evil) vivid black and white photography dovetailing splendidly with the matte paintings and Gothic set designs. It still amazes me to this day that this film was entirely produced on stage 2 at 20th Century Fox. So many images burn into the memory. From the shards of shadows that accompany young Jane as she stands on the punishment stool at Lowood Institution, put there by the despotic Henry Brocklehurst (a menacing Henry Daniell), to each chiaroscuro lit composition of Rochester in and around the oppressive like family home, the film has visual moodiness in abundance. \r\n\r\nHerrmann's (The Devil and Daniel Webster/Citizen Kane) score is crucially in tune as well. Orchestral swirls to portray Jane's longing are counter pointed by the menacing down beats that attack the viewer for Rochester's bluster. Away from the two leads it's young Peggy Ann Garner who delivers the most telling performance. She gives the child version of Jane a sorrowful edge that sets the tone of the film, her early scenes with an uncredited Elizabeth Taylor (beautiful and effectively correct in vocals) are a lesson in child acting. The rest of the cast is filled out with admirable performances from Margaret O'Brien (Meet Me in St. Louis), John Sutton (Captain from Castille), Sara Allgood (The Lodger) and Agnes Moorehead (The Magnificent Ambersons). \r\n\r\nThis may not be a definitive Jane Eyre adaptation, and the compromised ending does knock it down a point, but all told it's still a top piece of classic cinema. 9/10"

Robert Stevenson has created a wonderfully evocative glimpse at Victorian Britain, and with Charlotte Brontë's superb eye not just for the detail of the story, but for a subtle and nuanced social commentary of a time when - even amongst the most civilised in society - human beings had little, or no value. The film takes it's time to develop the characters, the locations - the use of light, shadow and another striking score from Bernard Hermann all augment the two leading performances offering us a gripping adaptation of a strong, characterful book.

Intrigued they go and take in a match and Bliss is hooked straight away, it's tough, competitive and even edgy. Telling a lie about her age, Bliss decides to try out for the \"Hurl Scouts\" and gets a place on the team as \"Babe Ruthless\". Thanks to her ability the \"Scouts\" start to turn around their season, however, with a new boyfriend on the scene and her parents unaware of her secret life, Bliss' new found happiness could come crashing down around her.\r\n\r\nIn spite of some favourable critical assessments, Drew Barrymore's directing debut barely made a dent at the box office. Just about making its money back on World gross, the figures would lend you to believe that the film simply isn't very good. Plot synopsis doesn't suggest anything out of the ordinary - yet another coming-of-age teenager picture, and one that is sports based, and even more formulaic than that, the sports team at the centre of proceedings is an underdog too! Throw into the equation that it's a female based movie and it's not really a film crying out for all demographics - or is it? Barrymore herself was very disappointed with the marketing for her movie, the general feeling being that it was sold as a girls sports love story type picture. She's absolutely right, it was marketed badly, and it barely had a run on the big screen in most countries. Which is a shame because Whip It is a smashing film, a picture that's vibrant, funny and not without dramatic worth - and yes! it's accessible for any age, sex or gender persuasion. Cross' script is fresh and free of filler and the cast all turn in jolly good shows, ranging from the excellent (Page/Gay Harden) to the engaging (Shawkat/Lewis/Wiig) and the funny (Stern/Fallon). OK, so it's not perfect, Barrymore is no Tony Scott when it comes to shooting action (some of the actual derby matches are confusing and not flowing), and maybe a bit more back story flesh for the other \"Hurl Scouts\" wouldn't have gone amiss? But these are minor itches at the beginning of what is hoped to be a long career in directing for Madame Barrymore.\r\n\r\nWith names like Jabba the Slut, Smashley Simpson and Iron Maven, it's evidently a film full of fun vim and vigour. But as great as that is (girls in skirts on skates belting each other around a track), the coming-of-age drama at its core should not be understated either. 8/10"

It's a very cliche \"I don't want your life\" beginning, but grounding the establishing act in that foundation really takes us on a journey of growth in this \"finding of self\" (possibly a \"coming of age\", but no really) story.  When something grabs our interests, even on a weird flyer, or a pair of skates, we should pay attention, and the smaller the thing is that calls out to you, the more you should pay attention.\r\n\r\nRoller derby is a bad ass little sport, and maybe \"no one gets famous\" or \"successful\" from it, but it looks fun and I'm sure the people that do it love it.  While the roller derby aspect is great, and the romantic plot lines are good, and the best friend angle is really good (just realizing how multi-threaded this movie actually is), it is the self discovery, the character growth of Bliss (thanks to Ellen Page's powerful delivery) of being a person that we can barely hear, to being someone how is able to yell for what she wants, delivery a hit, and be a literal poster child.\r\n\r\nThe movie honestly makes me envious: while I'd like to be an attractive tough girl, sure, to find a passion while you still have time to enough to enjoy it, to find people to guide and support that passion, and then compete and find adversity from people twice your age is an amazing thing all to itself.\r\n\r\nI'll never be a \"roller derby girl\", but I know I can always come live vicariously through this movie."

        "content": "_**Coming of age with the roller derby girls**_\r\n\r\nReleased in 2009, \"Whip It\" was Drew Barrymore's first and (so far) only full-length film in the director's chair. Drew also co-stars, but her character is decidedly peripheral.\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around 17 year-old Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page), her parents (Daniel Stern & Marcia Gay Harden) and her best friend, Pash (Alia Shawkat). Bliss is involved in the world of beauty pageants due to her mother's obsession, but becomes fascinated by a group of roller derby girls while visiting nearby Austin, TX. She decides to try-out for the the Hurl Scouts.\r\n\r\n\"Whip It\" starts out slow and only mildly interesting but it ultimately won me over. This is basically a coming-of-age drama using the roller derby as a backdrop and stage. Since Ellen Page takes center focus \"Whip It\" should appeal to fans of Page. I'm not a fan; I can take her or leave her. Thankfully, there's enough good here to draw in other folks.\r\n\r\nI especially like the roller derby girls and their camaraderie & competition. The girls include Juliette Lewis, Kristen Wiig, Eve, Zoe Bell, Ari Graynor, Eli Bleiler and Sydney Bennett. What I love about these women is that they have womanly curves and aren't walking sticks with big breasts. Take, for instance, the so-called Manson Sisters, played by Kristen Adolfi & Rachel Piplica; both are just gorgeous throughout the film and worth the price of admission -- stunning examples of womanhood.\r\n\r\nThere's a subplot about Bliss falling for a guy in a rock band (Landon Pigg) and there are other characters, like the coach, the derby announcer and the Hispanic manager of the restaurant Bliss & Pash work at (Andrew Wilson, Jimmy Fallon and Carlo Alban respectively), but this is mainly about Bliss, her family, Pash and the derby team.\r\n\r\nFINAL SAY: The drama in this coming-of-age flick is a mixed bag; I found the love story kind of tedious but enjoyed Pash and the family dynamics of the Cavendar household. The best part, of course, is the derby action and the ravishing derby babes in all their glory.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 111 minutes and was mostly filmed in Michigan (Detroit, Saline, Ypsilanti, Michigan, Birch Run and Hamtramck) with some shots of Austin, TX.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/B"

However, the makers put at the core an insurance issue that everyone can identify with, whilst piling on mystery and suspense by way of Jigsaw's left envelopes and the FBI closing in on an increasingly overt confident Hoffman. 7/10"

From what I've read on the internet about the story, I believe the movie does justice to the source material, but as I didn't get the story to read it, I want to make it clear that I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nSumming up in a few words the whole plot, what we have is a story in which a poor teenager, whom his father taught to steal, penetrates the palace of King Henry VIII and comes across the heir to the crown, Prince Edward. The two quickly realize that they are identical lookalikes and the prince decides to change clothes with the beggar so they both go to a masked ball. It turns out that the disguise turns out to be too good, and the real prince ends up expelled from the palace. After some misadventures, he enlists the help of a nobleman who returns to the kingdom after a long journey, making it imperative to undo the mistake before the coronation of the new king, since, in the meantime, Henry VIII dies.\r\n\r\nThe story has its appeal, but I have to confess that it sounded so far-fetched and hard to believe that I couldn't really like it. Forgive me, Twain fans. In addition, I was not pleased with the work of the director, Richard Fleischer. I felt he didn't give the film the most appropriate pacing and dynamics. Technically, the film is not very brilliant: I really liked the costumes, although it is not believable that all that gold and silk apparatus was routine and every day, even for the royalty of the time. And I also liked the scenarios used, which put us in the atmosphere of the time very quickly, both in the courtrooms and in the environments where the poor and the marginalized live. The soundtrack, sometimes a little raucous, works reasonably. Unfortunately, the cinematography has a lot of light and I didn't like it very much, overall.\r\n\r\nI left the cast for the end because I felt, throughout the film, that there was a huge dissonance between the various actors, something that, associated with bad direction, can help to understand why the film was a failure. There are a lot of solid and well-known names to the public at the time, but even that didn't help to convince people to pay the ticket and see it. We have, however, good interpretations that, ironically or because of the bad conception of the script, fall into the most indigestible characters in the film. Oliver Reed is the most impressive actor and leaves us very impressed, but the character is superb and boastful. Ernest Borgnine also does a good job and is very convincing, but it's impossible to like John Canty and the actor doesn't have much to do other than being obnoxious. Rex Harrison has an interesting role and is good at what he does, but appears very little. The rest of the actors can't enjoy what they get: Charlton Heston almost erases himself, Raquel Welch has absolutely nothing to do and never behaves like a lady, Mark Lester is a weak protagonist and is unable to convince."

Marmite is a food substance that people either love or hate, The Box is a Marmite movie. \r\n\r\nCameron Diaz and James Marsden star as a couple who are visited by a mysterious stranger (Frank Langella) who has a bizarre offer. The Box now in the couple's possession has a button (Langella's mysterious Arlington Steward informs them it's called the Button Unit), they are told that if they push the button then a complete stranger will die, they will then receive a life changing amount of money. What to do?. \r\n\r\nBased on a Richard Matheson short story titled \"Button, Button\", The Box is an ethereal mind meld of a piece. Morals and ethics are married up to a whole bunch of twists and other worldly ideas, which goes some way to explaining that where once there was a more than adequate half hour \"Twilight Zone\" episode (Profile in Silver/Button, Button 1986), there is now a near two hour movie crammed to the brim. It's this that hurts an otherwise stylishly produced and potentially thoughtful picture. \r\n\r\nAfter the raves and craves for his \"Donnie Darko (2001)\", Richard Kelly appeared to believe the press praise, that here was a new surreal director on the block. Where \"M. Night Shyamalan\" had success with the twist gimmick and couldn't let it go until his career went in the swamp, so to Kelly who kept straining to make movies that were needlessly over complex, trying to be smart when it isn't needed (\"Southland Tales (2006)\" is a car wreck of a movie). The Box does have intelligence and lots of good ideas, but a two hour film it does not make, with the attempts at weaving all the threads together proving to be too problematic come the finale. Incredulity a most appropriate word, plausibility is not. \r\n\r\nThe Box, an intriguing - attractive - failure, but some do and will love it. If you haven't seen it then roll the dice and good luck. 6/10\r\n\r\nFootnote: We have yet to actually get an adaptation to screen that contains Matheson's original literary ending!"

If you've ever seen \"The Drum\" (1938) then you will know the plot - and everyone pulls together well in this comedy swipe at the Raj and and the stiff-upper-lipped members of the \"Third Foot-and-Mouth Regiment\". I was never the biggest fan of Roy Castle, but he is quite effective here as are the regulars - especially Joan Sims and Bernard Bresslaw as henchman \"Bungdit Din\". The Welsh valleys pass well enough for the Himalayas, and the jokes and action come thick and fast enough to raise plenty of smiles before an ending that will make any Scotsman cringe. Like all of this franchise, it has dated badly, but taken in the spirit it was intended, it is still an half decent collegiate effort that I quite enjoy watching now and again."

A Joss Whedon-(co)written (also co-written and directed by Drew Goddard, who wrote Cloverfield) take on an old horror staple in which 5 stereotypical teenagers (an academic, a jock, a stoner, a slut and a \"nice\" girl) venture out into the woods for a dirty weekend. It's no spoiler to say that these unfortunate young naïfs appear to have been cherry-picked and are being heavily monitored all the way into the woods by some very (very) high-tech manner of... what? Government agency? It's with these fellows that we visit first, before we ever meet our protagonists; two middle-aged, white collar I.T. types, a little brow-beaten by what appears to be a fairly monotonous job (although it really ****ing isn't) but full of typical office cameraderie and essentially confident in their own competence and that of the numerous other departments that make up this rather large-scale operation. Whoever is watching our heroes/heroines, they're big-time. So, what's happening? To say more would be to start giving things away, but those kids are very deliberate archetypes, placed in a very deliberately typical horror scenario. Because it's an American film set in America, it's called The Cabin in the Woods as is befitting the conventions of God-knows-how-many American horror flicks. Were it a J-Horror set in Tokyo, it would be called The Freaky Long-Haired Schoolgirl Ghost, an assertion ably illustrated in the film itself to great and rather humourous effect.\r\n\r\nDecent performances all-round, even the deliberately irritating characters are kind-of likeable. A pre-Thor Chris Hemsworth is particularly good as is Richard Jenkins (Nathaniel \"The Dead Patriarch\" Fisher from Six Feet Under). It threw me a bit, this film, because in purposely not looking too deeply at what it was about prior to seeing it, I mistakenly thought I was about to watch a seriously scary and effective horror, and this isn't the case at all. It's a slick product with what looks like a decent budget as you'd expect from a Joss Whedon project (in case you've been under a rock somewhere, he of Buffy/Angel and latterly of The Avengers fame) and it's loaded with nods to other horror literary and cinematic classics (The Evil Dead, Hellraiser, The Strangers and HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos are all fairly explicitly referenced), but it's not especially gory, it's intentionally funny more often than it's intentionally scary and it's a real thrill-ride, a slice of fun. It's not quite there, but it's a damn site closer to \"Horror-Comedy\" than it is to balls-out \"Horror\". It's not perfect by a long way - it instills bags of concerned curiosity in the viewer, but provokes almost zero real tension whatsoever. And late-on a special effects extravaganza treads clumsily into Night at the Museum-for-grown-ups territory. But it remains a great way to spend a couple of hours."

Another thing that really drags down the film are these utter morons in the control room. If this was really a matter of survival of mankind then you would have thought that it would have been left to professional people and not these jerks.\n\nThe movie isn’t all bad though.

        "content": "**The following is a long-form review that I originally wrote in 2012.**\r\n\r\nJesus Christ. What just happened to my brain?\r\n\r\nI was worried that _Cabin in the Woods_ was gonna be a letdown, ‘cause I had built it up so much in my head, and it seemed such a ridiculous concept that it would have been nearly impossible to pull off flawlessly. And maybe it won’t go to join the ranks of my favourite films in existence, but it was… So. Fucking. Good.\r\n\r\nDrew Goddard (who wrote _Cloverfield_) is no stranger to working with Joss Whedon (_Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Avengers_) and my God do they ever make a team. Joss Whedon is my unopposed all-time favourite person involved in the film industry in any way, shape, or form. Which is quite the claim, given my interests. He’s had a couple of fuck ups, and been fucked around a few times too, but all in all, nobody captures me quite the way he does.\r\n\r\nI’ll try and aim for not-spoilers, if you watch the trailer you’ll get that this isn’t a typical horror movie. You’ll also pick up on that if you watch the first 5 minutes of the damn thing. I won’t go into the finer details, but let me just reiterate, it is NOT a slasher film. There’s a fair amount of horror, some action, some sci-fi, a bit of fantasy, some short but sweet comedy, a bunch of thriller, a little monster-movie, a bit of homage and a healthy (but not overdone) dose of parody. Joss Whedon tends to do that, his work is usually less in the horror genre and more in the… Genre genre. If that makes sense.\r\n\r\nI seem to recall it performing kind of averagely at the box office, but critical reception was fantastic. And rightfully so. And fan-aimed movies as good as this always manage to fall into their cult, so there’s a pretty avid group of people who are super keen on it, too. Again, rightly so. I think the best (as well as most important) thing about _Cabin in the Woods_, is that it pumps some new blood into horror. Sure, it wasn’t 100% original, but then it never claimed to be. At least it wasn’t a sequel or another bloody remake.\r\n\r\nSeriously, I hate on remakes much, much less than most, but come on people! This is all rather ridiculous. Imagine if the Wachowskis had said “Hey, we’ve got this great idea for a dystopian, industrial sci-fi type thing called _The Matrix_… Actually, you know what? That sounds like an awful lot of effort. Let’s do an over the top American remake of _The Castle_ instead!” Yeah, sounds like a great world to live in. Fuckin’… Lazy ‘n shit…\r\n\r\nLost track there, anyway! _Cabin in the Woods_! Fuck! Good! Watch that shit! Make up your own mind of course, but I really dig it. There’s something to be said for being fucked up and going with it. I’m sure some people will dismiss _Cabin_ entirely, because it’s so out there. And I’m sure even more people will get pissy about the ending. But if you have no expectations, and just try enjoy the ride, then I think you damn well might.\r\n\r\n87%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_"

Of course, chaos ensues and when he bumps into his long lost love again, that just makes matters worse... The bond between the stars, and their wonderful affinity with each other is great to see; but the jokes are all very tame and the inclusion of \"Shine on Harvey Moon\" though really quite accomplished, has no obvious place in the narrative...

It stars Gregory Peck, Sophia Loren, Alan Badel, John Merivale and Harold Kasket. A Panavision/Technicolor production with music by Henry Mancini and cinematography by Christopher Challis.\r\n\r\nHieroglyphics expert David Pollock (Peck) is thrust into a world of shifty political intrigue involving a Middle Eastern Prime Minister, a beautiful spy and a sinister rich businessman.\r\n\r\nThere's quite a bit wrong with Arabesque, with white actors made up as Arabs, a scatter-gun plot, weak finale, a barely threatening villain and Peck is no action hero! Yet if you can just run with it, to enjoy being in the company of the stars? Then there's fun to be had here.\r\n\r\nPart comedy, part thriller mystery, Arabesque zips along at a decent clip and Donen inserts memorable scenes along the way. From a wonderful shower sequence to chase me perils at a Zoo and a building site, there's truly a great will of spirit involved in the production. Donen also at times chooses to shoot the movie through a kaleidoscopic prism, and uses canted angles to accentuate David Pollock's confusion. These are nice touches, as is Mancini's Eastern flavoured musical arrangement.\r\n\r\nPeck may be no action hero type actor but his sense of fun here, and his all round classy charm, makes it very easy to root for him. Loren looks fabulous, a real sex-bomb pouting away with a glint in her eye. Not all of the Christian Dior costumes suit her character, but Loren, herself seemingly having a great old time of it, comes through the picture with flying colours. Elsewhere the performances are merely adequate, with Badel's villain coming off like a weak Peter Sellers clone!\r\n\r\nSo a mixed bag for sure and the shadow of Donen's wonderful Charade three years earlier looms large at times, but it's an enjoyable enough ride while it lasts. 7/10"

Stephen Campbell Moore (Debelzaq), Stephen Graham (Hagamar) and Robert Sheehan (Kay) accompany the Knights.\r\n\r\nThis is basically the American version of \"Black Death,\" a European film released around the same time. Both movies are dark, gritty and brutal in their depictions of Medieval Europe, but \"Season of the Witch\" is more of a stereotypical blockbuster with modish protagonists, amusing one-liners and CGI-laden climax. \"Black Death\" is deeper, more thought-provoking and realistic, which is why I give it the edge in overall value (see my review).\r\n\r\n\"Season\" is the more conventionally entertaining movie and anyone who appreciates Dark Ages-based flicks are highly encouraged to check it out. Films which come to mind include \"In the Name of the Rose\" (1986), \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005), \"Robin Hood\" (2010), \"Ironclad\" (2011), \"King Arthur\" (2004), \"Dragonslayer\" (1981), \"Red Riding Hood\" (2011), \"Tristan + Isolde\" (2006) and \"Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves\" (1991). It's as good, or better, than any of these.\r\n\r\nThe colorful Medieval cinematography (castles, dungeons, villages, dark forests and breathtaking mountains) is mind-blowing and the two protagonists are great with their amusing rapport. Furthermore, Foy is easy-on-the-eyes. Look out for a thrilling rope-bridge crossing à la \"Sorcerer\" (1977). Although the climax is over-the-top cartoony, the tone up to that point is quasi-realistic, similar to \"Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.”\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 35 minutes and was shot in Austria, Hungary and Croatia with reshoots done in Louisiana. WRITERS: Bragi F. Schut. ADDITIONAL CAST: Christopher Lee is almost unrecognizable as the plague-ridden Cardinal D'Ambroise.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-/B+\r\n"

        "content": "**A perfect example of how disrespect for the past and history can totally annihilate a film, even if it is fiction.**\r\n\r\nI really enjoy watching period films. However, my work as a historian gives me some antibodies to these films, for reasons linked to the lack of ability to harmonize creative freedom and strict respect for the historical facts and period customs. So, it was with some curiosity that I decided to see this film. After seeing it, I just wanted to slap director Dominic Sena and screenwriter Bragi Schut. None deserve any respect for what has been done here. The film is an insult to historians… even if it is not deliberate!\r\n\r\nThe script is the film's biggest problem, with a writing that seems to glue together fragments of several different stories: we start with the Crusades, we follow two knights in several military episodes and then, somewhat brusquely, they turn their backs on the Church (supposedly) and leave, probably for their homeland. It turns out that, on the way, they come across the Plague, and there is a woman, supposedly a witch, who was arrested, accused of causing the disease. Now, it's up to them the task of escorting the so-called witch to a monastery where some friars will judge her, in the light of a book that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen you make a film with a historical background, at the very least, you should ask for the support of a consultant, someone who really knows History. No one should have the presumptuous arrogance to think they know everything, much less to take the public for an idiot, thinking that they will swallow everything that is shown to them! This film is an authentic case study in cinematic anachronism! How can the production admit the placement of clearly baroque decorative pieces in the midst of a medieval setting? How the hell can characters to disinfect their hands with alcohol if that was something totally unknown to medieval man? Since when is there a sea in Styria, if that ancient region is an inland part of present-day Austria and Slovenia? How can characters defect if this military concept simply didn't exist at the time?\r\n\r\nAnd if these small questions seem serious, there is something much worse: the Crusades were an entire religious, political and military effort that involved Christianity for about 300 years, but that effort had practically ended decades before the Black Death, and much before the dates that the film uses for the fights where the characters take part. There were, in fact, no serious crusades in the 14th century. The Battle of Artah, which is shown in the film, took place two hundred years earlier, in 1105. Therefore, the film deliberately delayed the Crusades two hundred years, in order to almost coincide with the Black Death, and the characters could participate in both situations! It's absurd! Another thing that simply didn't exist in the Middle Ages was the notion of a witch hunt! Of course, for medieval man, the Devil was a threat, and of course there was a relationship between diabolical art and the works and studies of many scholars, alchemists or sages who contradicted the religious knowledge. But the so-called witch persecutions only began to be more notable in the 16th century, framed in a clerical response to the Reformation and to ideas (all of them) that endangered the dominion that the Church had over knowledge!\r\n\r\nI pity Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman. They are actors I respect, and seeing them participate in such a poorly made film is quite unfortunate, given that they have talent and are, as far as I've seen, almost the only positive things to highlight. Even if everything had been done in a way that respects history, the end of the film is so unbelievably stupid that it would spoil any previous effort. The rest of the cast, except for the two names mentioned, do not stand out in any way."

After an opening scene showing simpleton postman János demonstrating to a bar full of drunks how the Earth and moon rotate around the sun with the help of three of the old geezers, he does his rounds in the early morning. Posters put up advertise the arrival of a giant whale with special guest, the Prince. This traveling circus, however, fills the townspeople not with eager anticipation but with dread. Indeed, when the Prince does appear, all hell breaks loose.\r\n\r\nBased on the novel The Melancholy of Resistance by László Krasznahorkai, the plot of this film is a transparent allegory for Hungary in the 1930s and 1940s: unable to keep its house in order, and falling for the demagoguery of fascism, Hungary brought on itself its long nightmare of Soviet domination. Tarr has curiously stated, however, that he is not offering us a historical allegory. By that I can only imagine that he is turning the allegory into a parable, using a reference to mid 20th-century Hungary as way of exploring more universal themes. Perhaps the central tension in the film is between a natural order, the ecstatic cooperation of free human beings, and an order dictated by a manipulative leader. I don't want to spoil anything that happens here, but Tarr's depiction of a mob let loose is harrowing.\r\n\r\nI was very moved by this film the first time I saw it, and on repeat viewings there has been much to appreciate. I feel, however, that the film is greatly weakened by Tarr's decision to use German actors for two main roles. Lars Rudolph, who plays János, and Fassbinder mainstay Hanna Schygulla as the sinister \"auntie Tünde\" give physically commanding performances, but they were presumably speaking in German while acting, and Tarr has had them clumsily dubbed into Hungarian, no synchronization between their mouths and the voices."

It stars Peter Cushing, Martita Hunt, Yvonne Monlaur and David Peel. Music is by Malcolm Williamson and cinematography by Jack Asher.\r\n\r\n\"Transylvania, land of dark forests, dread mountains and black unfathomed lakes, still the home of magic and devilry as the nineteenth century draws to its close. Count Dracula, monarch of all vampires is dead, but his disciples live on to spread the cult and corrupt the world\"\r\n\r\nThe Curse of Frankenstein and Dracula had given Hammer Film Productions enormous success in 1957 and 1958 respectively, it was success that transformed the British film industry's fortunes and put British horror on the map from there on in. The Brides of Dracula is the first of what would eventually be 8 sequels to Dracula, but before it could flourish it had to overcome a major obstacle. Christopher Lee, who had made such an impact as the blood sucking count in the first film, would not return. It's believed a combination of two things prevented Lee's return, firstly he was wary of typecasting and wanted to nail down some other acting roles first, and secondly Hammer didn't want to pay an inflated fee for his services now that he was a name actor.\r\n\r\nIs Lee's absence felt? Yes it is. For although in the main, with some nifty writing and a solid plot - with the makers managing to swerve not having Dracula the character in their movie - David Peel's performance as Baron Meinster is a little weak. Which is a shame because all else around him is gloriously lush. There's a little contrivance dropped in, and a logic plot hole the size of a coffin that involves the Baron being chained up by the ankle (erm, he can turn into a bat can't he?!), but yes, this is a top production that pulses with Gothic atmosphere and features some excellent and memorable scenes. With Fisher's direction full of classy shots and Asher's Technicolor photography deliciously ornate, it's one of Hammer's best vampire based movies.\r\n\r\nCushing again is the star, and tantalisingly we are made to wait here for the appearance of his vampire slaying Van Helsing. When we used to watch Hammer films as kids we were always reassured once Cushing showed up, the actor had a class and elegance about him that made us feel safe when the horror began to unfold! Hunt is twitchy and regal in equal measure as Baroness Meinster, Monlaur is pretty and adds some continental flavour to the stew and Freda Jackson is just scary! Were it not for Peel's foppish and fey approach to villainy, it would be well cast across the board. Bernard Robinson's production design is one of Hammer's best (Castle Meinster, The Running Boar Inn, The Windmill) and Williamson's music is in turns ominous and evocative.\r\n\r\nFrom the eye scorching blood red opening titles, to the stunning and ingenious finale (the final shot is a doozy), The Brides of Dracula is a damn enjoyable Hammer Horror picture that's very much the equal of the first film. 8/10"

When vampirism breaks out Dr. Van Helsing offers his skills to save the locals (Peter Cushing).  \r\n\r\n\"The Brides of Dracula\" (1960) is the sequel to Hammer’s “Horror of Dracula” (1958). It was originally supposed to be called “Disciples of Dracula” since Dracula doesn’t actually appear in the story. Instead there’s the unknown David Peel as Baron Meinster, who does a fine job, but he’s very different from Christopher Lee and more akin to Frank Langella’s take on Dracula in his 1979 film. \r\n\r\nThe set-up of the story is similar to most Dracula yarns: Sophisticates from Western Europe travel to Transylvania and end up spending the night at a diabolical chateau where vampiric horror ensues. As usual with Hammer, the atmosphere is Gothic, the colors lush and the women beautiful (particularly Yvonne Monlaur). The mother is an interesting character and formidable woman; her reasons for doing what she does are understandable.  \r\n\r\nFor those interested, the nine Dracula-themed films Hammer did are: “Horror of Dracula” (1958), “The Brides of Dracula” (1960), “Dracula: Prince of Darkness” (1966), “Dracula Has Risen from the Grave” (1968), “Taste the Blood of Dracula” (1970), “Scars of Dracula” (1970), “Dracula A.D. 1972” (1972), “The Satanic Rites of Dracula” (1973) and “The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires.” Christopher Lee plays Dracula in every one of these except \"The Brides of Dracula\" and \"The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires.\" Meanwhile Peter Cushing plays Van Helsing in five of them (although not always the same Van Helsing, since two of the installments take place in the modern day).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 25 minutes, and was shot at Bray Studios, just west of London (interiors), and nearby Black Park and Oakley Court (exteriors).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

I guess the budget would her been minimal, and I'm glad I've seen it - but more for the sake of late 30s cinema than for anything memorable."

There is nothing here to trouble the censors, a bit of violence here and there - and some nasty human traits seam through the story, but this is purely a funny and touching movie that again deals with a Peckinpah fave theme of the Old West passing. Only difference is here he has his tongue firmly in cheek as he observes the thirst for finance sweeping across the country.\r\n\r\nCable Hogue is a prospector left for dead in the desert by his two double-crossing partners Bowen & Taggart. Wandering across the desert talking to god, Hogue collapses during a sandstorm and finds mud on his boot, after digging down for a while he finds the miracle of water (though Hogue badly misspells this on his advertisement). An encounter with preacher Joshua convinces Hogue to go patent his spring and make a killing selling water to the passing stagecoach trail that runs by his newly found oasis. After striking a deal in the town of Dead Dog, Hogue is set up nicely while into the bargain he falls for gorgeous prostitute Hildy. The film cheekily (just like Hogue) has established itself as a fine piece by the time it takes it's dark turn. It seems that revenge is the new found recipe on the Cable Springs Menu.\r\n\r\nThis was Sam Peckinpah's favourite film from his own CV, it's his most personal, he apparently saw a lot of himself in Cable Hogue, and with that in mind the film does gain a bit more emotional heart. But strikingly, it's the humour in there that shouldn't be understated, this was the director at one with himself, and the result is lyrical deftness. The cast are great, Jason Robards is wonderful in the title role, Stella Stevens as Hildy shows a fine actress at work. So much so it only makes me lament that she didn't have a great and industrious career post Cable Hogue. Peckinpah faves Strother Martin, L.Q. Jones & Slim Pickens reward their loyal director with impacting shows, while David Warner as the confused sexual predator preacher Joshua practically steals the film with his hedonistic leanings.\r\n\r\nDon't go into this film expecting a blood and thunder Western and you will be pleasantly surprised at its thematic heartbeat. Different sort of Peckinpah, but it's also essential Peckinpah. 9/10"

Ron Perlman plays a cop and Chris Browning a curiously intrusive stranger. Jane directed the film based on a script by Tab Murphy.\r\n\r\n“Dark Country” (2009) is a modern Hitchcock-ian mystery/thriller similar in tone to, say, “Wind Chill” (2007) but with a different story and inverse setting (the nighttime desert rather than the nighttime snowy forest). The first half is slow-going with mundane dialogues and weird goings-on, but the story picks up in the second. Unfortunately, the last act is muddled and leaves you with many questions. But, if you reflect on it, the answers are there if you care enough to seek ’em out.\r\n\r\nVisually, this is a masterpiece of mood and haunting imagery. Have you ever stopped at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere late at night? How about hang out in the desert wilderness at night, whether in a vehicle or on foot? Either can be eerie and “Dark Country” captures this. Story-wise, however, it’s not as good as “Wind Chill”; the strange climax lacks the emotional whollop and is just too ambiguous IMHO.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 28 minutes and was shot in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

It stars Barbara Stanwyck, Paul Douglas, Robert Ryan and Marilyn Monroe. Music is by Roy Webb and cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca.\r\n\r\nTis a tale of stilted raw passions, frustrations and wrong decisions that unfurl in a California seacoast fishing town. Essentialy it finds Stanwyck as Mae Doyle who returns to her home town fishing village of Menterey, Calif. She's bitter and unfullfilled and marries the amiable but not very bright Jerry D'Amato (Douglas) in spite of both their better judgements. With her being inexplicably drawn to Jery's woman hating friend, Earl (Ryan), and her brother Joe (Andes) fretting that his sister Peggy (Monroe) will be corrupted by Mae's bitterness, it's a hotbed of character fallibilities.\r\n\r\nTo my mind It's all very stagy and a little too overwrought, and frustrating given that the themes within the play looked to be perfect for the great Fritz Lang. Not that it's either a stinker or a critical bomb (like the play itself), it isn't, it's just too soap opera to fully ignite the thematics at the core of the story. On the flip side, aside from Douglas' awful histrionic laden peformance, the acting is top notch. You may not care about these characters but you can't be anything but very involved and hang on to see what will happen to them all. Dialogue is a plus point, resplendent with barbs and choiceisms, while although the also great Musuraca is not in is chirascuro element, there's enough atmospheric photography - particularly when story plays out at the docks setting - to catch the eyes with mood compliance. Unfortunately the unconvicing sets are matched by the wholly unconvincing and disappointing finale.\r\n\r\nJust above average and lower tier fare on the CV's of Lang, Ryan and Stanwyck, it does however serve notice of what promise Monroe had. If only she could have been led the right way by genuine people. See this if only for Monroe's sprightly turn. 6/10"

It stars Drew Barrymore, James Legros, Ione Skye, Michael Ironside, Joe Dallesandro and Billy Drago. Music is by Ed Tomney and cinematography by Lisa Rinzer. \r\n\r\n\"Love made them crazy. Guns made them outlaws!\" \r\n\r\nHigh schooler Anita Minteer (Barrymore) is abused at home and at school and by so called friends. Seeking some sort of solace, she befriends - via letters - a convict named Howard (Legros). When Howard is paroled, the pair hook up and quickly find a loving bond. A bond that also involves a passion for guns... \r\n\r\nIn spite of reports in some quarters, this is not a remake of Joseph H. Lewis' superb film noir of the same name (though the words gun and crazy are separated there) from 1950. Whilst it's also worth mentioning that it's not a knock-off of Bonnie and Clyde (outstanding and trailblazing pic for sure), because for that to be the case we would have to ignore the fact that Lewis' film, and the likes of They Live by Night (Nicolas Ray - 1948) , were not key influences and big movers in the lovers on the lam splinter of noir. It is of course, an amalgamation of said influences, and despite a relatively average rating on the big internet movie sites, this is a neo-noir well worth seeking out for those so inclined. \r\n\r\nStudents of classic era film noir can't but help to be pulled in by the many deviance's at work, themes involving sexual abuse, promiscuity, impotence, alienation, prostitution and foolish love, the latter pitching a classic noir character into a vortex from which they in all probability know they can't return from. It's not that Anita is a femme fatale, because she's so young and isn't written as a viper type, it's that her youthful ignorance, her teenage hormones tortured by a torrid upbringing, is enough for Howard to grasp onto as a semblance of normality. They are both fools, but honest with it, it's the classic romanticised dream going sour. Again, a classic film noir trait. \r\n\r\nVisually there is much to recommend here. The use of slatted shadows and balustrade is cunning and nods appreciatively to influences past, the inference obviously that Howard may be out of prison, but he's still behind bars. Davis throws in a number of striking scenes, a camera shot looking out as a grave is dug, our lovers close and personal (sexy) as they shoot guns, and the finale has a sad grace that, \"again,\" noir lovers can appreciate. Matthew Bright's screenplay also has black comedy elements, the script devious with Freudian smarts, while the cast turn in performances worthy of the form. \r\n\r\nOK! So this formula has been done better before, and yes we want more of Ironside and Drago (wonderful characters), and this may have underwhelmed those after a gun crazy action thriller - while Barrymore fans back in the day may have been bemused - but it's a very smart and neatly constructed neo-noir. 7.5/10"

Look at what the movie is about, spies ala Nightmare on Elm Street, it doesn't really need to be a big budget film to be fun and watchable.\r\n\r\nAnd it is fun and watchable. Dennis Quaid was the absolute best pick for the role, his personality (which is usually watchable) meshes well with the character, and the character he plays is written brilliantly for the role. The heroic and lovable slacker, but a slacker of near epic proportions that rises up to the situation. You couldn't cast better in 1984.\r\n\r\nAnd then he's paired against Max Von Sydow who, in his lifetime, won far less awards than he was worth. He was one of the best actors to ever live and he's in a B science fiction movie. He's a guy that brings his A game to everything.\r\n\r\nSo out the door it has great casting going for it. But then, moving on from that, the plot is just fun, not at all too serious, it knows what sort of movie that it is, it knows it's budget and limitations, and it is presented with the appropriate seriousness and tongue-in-cheek to keep the audience engaged from start to finish.\r\n\r\nIt's not at all a perfect movie, but it is a fun movie, it is an entertaining movie. It doesn't have much to complain about (save for Nightmare on Elm St did it better) but it does have what it takes to keep you engaged, entertained, and at the end, satisfied."

The depth and height of the stage allows the band to arrive on set song by song, and for the camera work to get down and dirty with the band members amidst the most sparing of sets as they churn out some of the repertoire in an inimitable style that cleverly marries the intense with the entertaining, the comedic and the slightly fantastic. The audio is of an astonishingly strong quality, and the closeness and intensity of the photography makes the film really quite enthralling to watch.

Story has five new inmates sent to a North African based British Army Prison, the centre piece of which is a manufactured hill that is used as a punishment tool. The new recruits, headed by Joe Roberts (Sean Connery), quickly fall foul of the superiors, especially the venomous Staff Sergeant Williams (Ian Hendry), but these boys wont take it lying down...\r\n\r\nWith no music and Oswald Morris' monochrome photography ensuring atmosphere is perpetually claustrophobic, the harsh edges of the story strike hard. Be it overt bullying by those in charge - pushing men evidently too far - or racism, Lumet melds everything together superbly for harsh viewing experience, tightening the screws every quarter of film. Come the shattering conclusion it's a merciful release for the viewers, a chance to start breathing properly again, even if your mind is ablaze with a number of thoughts.\r\n\r\nThis is very much an actors picture, which seems a given since it's adapted by Ray Rigby from his own play, but a mightily strong cast do sterling work with the tinderbox screenplay. Ossie Davis, Harry Andrews, Ian Bannen, Roy Kinnear, Alfred Lynch and Michael Redgrave fill out the other key roles, each giving their characters vivid depth without resorting to histrionics and scenery chewing. Which of course is a testament to Lumet's skills as a director of actors.\r\n\r\nSlow burning intensity bristles with the corrosive nature of machismo fuelled authority, an unforgettable film and highly recommended to those who have not sampled it yet. 9/10"

There they are at the mercy of Commandant Maximilian Burger (Kenny Williams) and Sergeant Nocker (Phil Silvers brought in to try and boost American ticket sales).\r\n\r\nJapery is prominent as the not so intrepid Legionnaires get involved with an angry army of Bedouins led by Sheikh Abdul Abulbul (Bernard Bresslaw). Joan Sims has a minor role as a big cleavage landlady, while it's Angela Douglas snagging the main gal role as Lady Jane Ponsonby, with a running gag of her sexual innocence being mined for all it's worth. It's actually a better film than the iffy reputation afforded it. True, missing big hitters like Sid James and Hattie Jacques is felt, but Silvers is ebullient playing a Bilko character, while it's nice to see the excellent Jim Dale bag the English lead and not letting anyone down.\r\n\r\nIt sits somewhere in the middle scale of Carry On films, neither too bawdy nor like the genial black and whites. But plenty of laughs to be had and it's a good production, the Camber Sands locations surprisingly passing muster as the Legionnaires desert hell.

Nocker\". Clearly, someone thought that importing him into this might breathe some fresh air into the franchise. Sadly, for me at any rate, it doesn't. He just overwhelms the whole thing with this rather brash and unsubtle humour and coupled with the over-use of the annoying Dale this just ends up being a rather messy desert-meleé that sees the troop getting lost before getting found and then combatting the evil Sheikh \"Abdul Abulbul\" (Bernard Bresslaw) to secure the \"Nooki\" oasis. Joan Sims and Charles Hawtrey are here alright, but neither really gets much opportunity to gatecrash the \"Bilko\"-ing of the film and it sort of reminded me of that old adage about something not being broke... It's a shame, though - this subject matter could have provided quite a rich seam for their style of comedy had it just concentrated on what it had been good at, kept it British - and not tried to internationalise itself."

At times, there are still traces of the old style of slapstick humour; the writing is quite funny now and again and there is plenty of \"how's your father\" - real or imaginary for us to chortle at.

I'm no jazz fan either, but I am always happy to listen to it when it comes up though.\r\n\r\nDespite that, I just couldn't get into the film itself.

I literally gave an internal cheer when the credits finally rolled around.\r\n\r\nI do enjoy Forest Whitaker as an actor and he is probably the reason I'm not rating this lower. As for the rest, I don't even recall any of them - though I'm putting that down to what I've already noted, as opposed to the cast themselves who I'm sure tried their upmost.\r\n\r\nWay too long, in short.

Concerning that last possibility:  There are supposedly nine documented virgin births on record and the offspring were all girls who looked like their mothers.  The idea that Agnes calls the baby \"she” augments this possibility, plus the fact that she seemingly has enough faith to put holes in her hand, aka stigmata, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?\r\n\r\nI’m not going to say what conclusion the ambiguous film points to, if any. \r\n\r\n“Stigmata” (1999) covers some of the same ground but is from the thriller/horror genre whereas “Agnes of God” is more mundane. “Stigmata” is all-around more compelling while “Agnes” is rather one-dimensional with women constantly confronting each other with a lot of screaming and crying. Yes, there are heavy reasons for these emotional dialogues, and those reasons are interesting to explore, but the story just wasn’t gripping for me. Too bad, because Fonda, Bancroft and Tilly bend over backwards to pull it off.\r\n\r\nWhile the movie didn’t really work for me, it’s a passionate and noble effort centering around faith, logic and ultimate reality (truth). And I have no doubt it has a cult following. Give it a try if the themes trip your trigger, but you’ll probably be disappointed.  \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot in Rockwood & Toronto, Ontario, with establishing shots of Montreal.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"

Teamed up with a splendid comedy horse who gets up to mischief when ever possible, the boys also find some sexy lady love interests that puts a nice little risqué cheek on things, cheek actually being a very literal word at times.\r\n\r\nTechnically it's a very good production. Filmed in Metrocolor/Panavision, the vistas are superbly photographed by Vogel, with Arizona locations including Coconino National Forest, Red Rock Crossing, San Francisco Peaks and Village of Oak Creek. The stunt work is high quality, well shot by the wily Western movie veteran Kennedy, while Alexander's musical compositions have the desired jolification.

Danny Glover is top notch as George, as is a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Roger. You also have Tony Danza (Mel), Neal McDonough (Bass), Adrien Brody (Danny) and Christopher Lloyd (Al) all involved. Not a bad list at all, though I would've loved to have seen more of Lloyd who is very underused - his role, if more prevalent, could've raised the film up massively.\r\n\r\nWith all the silliness of the plot, there is still a nice amount of heart in there - which is entirely predictable, but I appreciated it nevertheless.

The first part depicts the Exodus and Leviticus books from the Old Testament - the story of Moses leading the slaves from their somewhat brutal existence in Egypt and the passing down of the Ten Commandments to the people as they build the great Tabernacle. The second part modernises the application of the Commandments and applies them to a family in 1920's America with two brothers who vie for the affections of the same girl whilst one seeks fame and fortune, the other a more contented existence. Both stories exhort the import of the Commandments as the basic tenets of human decency and values - and shy not from visiting severe punishments on those who transgress. The former story includes a wonderful score and, for the time, some pretty impressive special effects - especially the parting of the Red Sea. The second story is less impressive - more a slightly over-moralistic tale of greed and avarice that was hardly unusual then (or is now). The budget - some $1.8m was enormous for the time and the scale of the cinematography, extras etc. in phase one is impressive and convincing; the acting comes into it's own a bit more in the second act - with Richard Dix and Rod La Rocque playing the brothers well, and Nita Naldi shining as the Eurasian temptress \"Sally Lung\". As with so many silent films, it's all in their faces - and this one doesn't disappoint - even if there is a little too much theatrical gesturing and posturing now and again. On balance I probably prefer the 1956 iteration, again by De Mille, but there is little in it and if you do get a spare 2¼ hours then this is certainly a superb example of grand cinema from a visionary director."

        "content": "Adventuresome and fun \"Jaws\" homage with far superior women \r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1978 and directed by Joe Dante, “Piranha” chronicles events when genetically-enhanced piranha are accidently released into a river system in central Texas, which threaten kids & counselors at a Summer Camp and vacationers at a lake resort. A spirited skip tracer (Heather Menzies) and a backwoods drunkard (Bradford Dillman) team-up to save the swimmers. Kevin McCarthy and Barbara Steele play military scientists who experimented with the escaped piranha.\r\n\r\nWhile \"Piranha\" is sort of a \"Jaws\" (1975) knockoff, it’s different enough to not be a rip-off:  The story takes place in a river system deep in the mainland and not the ocean; the ‘monster’ consists of teams of little vicious fish rather than a huge Great White Shark; the beach sequences involve quaint campground-like beaches rather than major ocean beaches; unlike “Jaws,” there’s a focus on alluring young women, although “Jaws 2” (1978) delivered the goods in this area as well; there’s more of a sense of adventure and even suspense; and the tone mixes-in amusing elements with the horrific mayhem.\r\n\r\nAs inferred, the picture is highlighted by several quality females with curvy Belinda Balaski (from \"The Howling\") and cutie Melody Thomas Scott (from The Young and the Restless) featured in prominent roles. Moreover, voluptuous Janie Squire has some worthy screen time in the prologue. There are superb women in the periphery as well. Interestingly, the 2010 quasi-remake, “Piranha 3D,” took the sleaze route with loads of nudity, but the women are ironically hotter here, not to mention the film’s all-around more entertaining.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE IS LEAN and filler-free at 93 minutes and was shot along a river near San Marcos in the heart of Texas, Northeast of San Antonio. WRITERS: John Sayles and Richard Robinson.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

Particularly the \"hide the effect\" routine that Jaws made famous.  The practical effects aren't very good, which is why the best use of them was to hide the fish whenever possible.  In a way, it really works if the threat is massive, unstoppable, and nearly invisible.\r\n\r\nThe whole \"secret government project\" angle is a little irritating as this crossed my movie watching with my \"otherworldy research\": things like this are presented in movies as an absurd idea when they are reality.  Maybe not to this extent, but as the government used to claim Area 51 didn't exist, that should prove my point.\r\n\r\nThey cast was fine, I didn't see any problems, and I didn't see anything extra-ordinary from them.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a bad movie, there are just so many better things to watch, including the re-make, I guess."

It's so bad it's great and a fun ride as long as you expect a total cheesefest.**\r\n\r\nPiranha is cheesy 70s/80s creature films at their very best! It has everything - evil military generals, obligatory lake celebrations, scientific experimentation gone wrong, horrible dialogue, low-budget effects, and more. It's clear as you watch the film that Piranha was heavily influenced by Jaws, with the city ignoring the warnings of the dangerous underwater creature, the very similar movie poster, and much more. Steven Spielberg has even named it his favorite Jaws rip-off movie. This low-budget gem was a zeitgeist of creature horror cinema of the decade that didn't allow bad effects, poor acting, or no money to stop them from making their movies. The remakes in the 2000's just used this movie as an excuse to show a lot of nudity, and while there is a little nudity in Piranha (1978), it is much briefer than its predecessors. Pirahna (1978) focuses on letting the army of hungry fish gnaw on its helpless victims. This goofy little creature flick launched the career of director Joe Dante, who later collaborated with Steven Spielberg himself to make Gremlins - a real creature masterpiece! Piranha is no Gremlins, but it sure is a fun start to Dante's creepy creature-filled career."

Well, that might be the theory but when a meddlesome couple accidentally release a swimming pool's worth of genetically modified fish into a river, we discover that that mantra isn't strictly true! It's only because \"Dr. Hoak\" (Kevin McCarthy) is at the facility that our interfering pair - \"Maggie\" (Heather Menzies-Ulrich) and \"Paul\" (Bradford Dillman) learn of the potential disaster scenario looming - especially when they realise that there is a water park down the river populated with loads of noisy, bitesized, tourists just perfect for their peckish predators. Can they get down the river in time to stop carnage ensuing? On that front - well, there's not a hint of jeopardy but along the way Joe Dante does manage to create a slight sense of menace. The photography and slightly \"Psycho\"-esque score at times do make this occasionally a little uncomfortable to watch. That said - the acting is pretty woeful, as is the rather pedestrian dialogue and the special effects are not going to keep Ray Harryhausen awake at night. It might work quite well in a cinema, though, at Halloween after a couple of bottles of Wild Turkey. It's a fun, throw-away, adventure that swipes a little at the military meddling in the affairs of science and is actually quite entertaining. Aim low and you won't be disappointed."

This is all she needs at Christmas time!\r\n\r\nA lovely Christmas Cracker of a movie, Holiday Affair never over eggs the eggnog with the love triangle axis beating at the core story. The spectre of grief is a prominent character here, where thankfully the writers have come up with a smart and respectful screenplay that's blessed with quality actors able to make the script have resonance.\r\n\r\nThe seasonal staging is delightful, especially when involving a white coated Central Park. Comedy is also rife, none more so than during a court hearing sequence when Harry Morgan pops in to add his delightful wry skills. The wonder of toys and trees, of snow and ice, of families and love, all come together in a seasonal film that should be on every movie lovers list of Xmas films to see. 8/10"

The pair go on a date, he meets her young son \"Timmy\" (Gordon Gebert) and soon she has another man in her life... The film looks at her tussle between the safe and the unknown - and also takes a little look at her own character (previously widowed and reluctant to take the plunge again!). The star of the show, for me anyway, is the young boy. A natural in front of a camera, working well with two experienced stars in a fashion that I found most engaging. His are the last few scenes that gently deliver the common sense that we have long since all to easily guessed will prevail. The ending's a bit rushed, I thought - but a good quick-fire scene from an incredulous police lieutenant Harry Morgan and some fun with a train set make this a better than average Christmas feel-good drama."

This film is gritty, badly dubbed, bloody, gruesome, graphic and very poorly preserved by the ravages of time.

Starring Panna Rittikrai and Tony Jaa in some of their earlier work, this should be enough to peak the interest of any Martial Arts fan and if you don't know who these two giants are, you aren't a real aficionado of the genre.\r\n\r\nThe synopsis that you will read on most of the movie websites won't do the film justice. Take one part Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a giant helping of Jeff Spicoli and his crew from Fast Times at Ridgemont High with the remaining portions taken from Camp Crystal Lake (AKA Friday the 13th). Shake, stir and serve over ice. No matter what you might think of the concoction, it works for both a quick fix and the long run. Nevertheless, the dialog, and even the plot, is secondary to the almost constant action that leaps across the screen. This is top notch, as long as you aren't squeamish, and stands up to the Martial Artist wire-work of today without the benefit of the green screen F/X department.\r\n\r\nDifficult to find, and released as part of a trilogy, this one should be be high on your must-have list. if you come across this DVD, jump at the opportunity to pick it up and make sure you have plenty of popcorn at the ready for a family viewing."

What occasionally draws me to these types of films is their youthful energy and fun spirit, as well as the oceanic locations and the women. It brings one back in time to the carefree era of his/her coming-of-age years. Thankfully, \"The Flamingo Kid\" shoots for something deeper than just a shallow beach flick, which the best ones do, e.g. the original “Gidget” (1959).\r\n\r\nThe story takes place in 1963 where 18-year-old Jeffrey (Matt Dillon), a plumber's son from Brooklyn, gets a summer job at a private beach club on Long Island called the El Flamingo. This was his final summer of carefree fun before going off to college, but his experiences at the club change his plans. He makes loads of money on tips, meets a beautiful blonde and becomes fascinated by a new mentor, a fast-talking businessman and card shark, Phil Brody (Richard Crenna).\r\n\r\nBrody convinces Jeffrey that there are easier, faster (i.e. dishonest) ways to make loads of money than going off to college for years on end. When Jeffry cancels his college plans and moves out of his house it naturally creates friction with his father (Hector Elizondo). Will he go on to become the next generation's fast-talking businessman/card shark?\r\n\r\nAlmost the entire film was shot on location at a Queens’ beach club with loads of gorgeous females on hand, including Jeffrey's girlfriend in the story, Carla played by Janet Jones, whose body is so well sculptured she could’ve been Wonder Woman (the movie even jokes about this). Carole Davis also shines as Brody’s brunette daughter, Joyce, a low-key part. Cutie Marisa Tomei even has a cameo.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that \"The Flamingo Kid\" offers everything you'd want in such a film and more, including an interesting story where you care about the outcome. And, thankfully, there's NO RAUNCH (well, maybe a flash). In addition, the soundtrack includes numerous early 60's hits like \"Runaround Sue,\" etc. What's not to like?\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B+/A-"

Once that has been established, we can enjoy a witty and pithy observation of class and superficiality that raises both smiles and heckles in equal measure. Leslie Howard is great as the somewhat snobbish phonetics expert (\"Prof. Higgins\") who bets his pal \"Col. Pickering\" (Scott Sunderland) that he can take the gutturally linguistic flower girl \"Eliza\" (Wendy Hiller) and pass her off as a duchess to the highest of society. Hiller is super, too. She takes the role of the reluctant, naive but strong willed and savvy street seller by the scruff of the neck and before long we see that the Professor has more than met his match! His housekeeper \"Mrs. Pearce\" (Jean Cadell) has a go at umpiring now and again and there is a scene stealing performance from Esme Percy as the even more pompous \"Count Karpathy\" who is the one person \"Higgins\" fears may be able to rumble his deception. Right from the raucous and hilarious bathing scene, it sets off at quite a pace swiping relentlessly at the British societal system - ribbing snobs and workers alike as Bernard Shaw's story is transferred to celluloid in a way that (hopefully) the author would have appreciated too. I can't say I liked the ending of the play and I don't really much care for the ending here, either - but boy, it's one hell of a journey demonstrating creative skill at just about every turn."

We start with his rather undignified seizure at the steam baths by the home guard he is supposed to command and by way of a continuous retrospective, discover just how this man arrived at this embarrassing predicament. First there was the South African campaign, then the Great War saw him gain some prominence and also, after quite a few scrapes, sees him befriend his opposite number, as it were, in the form of the dashing German \"Theo\" (a beautifully understated contribution from Anton Walbrook). Becoming firm friends, they share the same social circles and it's here that \"Candy\" meets his future wife - Deborah Kerr. Trials and tribulations and then WWII all affect this man as he is promoted through the ranks and faces tragedy very close to home before the realisation that, at an elderly age, perhaps he is no longer of any value! What Powell and Pressburger have encapsulated into just over 2½ hours here, is a delightfully evocative story that deals with friendship and honour, with love, despair and the human desire to feel needed and wanted - but never without losing sight of the humanity of the situations and, quite often, with some degree of dark and stoic humour. There is a lovely chemistry between Livesey and Walbrook, and Deborah Kerr positively glows as she remains the woman in his life - in various guises - throughout. The contrast between the evolving behaviours is subtly but potently drawn here: we see a society that no longer considered any \"niceties\" of war - symptomatic of a sea of changing attitudes with which both men struggle to adapt. Sure, there's nostalgia - but it's of a palpable and immersive nature. IT's not at all sentimental. We take sides initially - jingoism isn't far away, but certainly as it progresses and the decency of these individuals is laid bare, I found myself rather admiring the integrity on display here from two different but remarkably similar perspectives. As to that display, the aesthetic of this film is glorious. The wartime sets, the bucolic and peaceful scenes, the romance, the disaster - all delivered here with great skill by Georges Périnal's artistic touch and Allan Gray's charmingly complementary score. I can't really pick a favourite P&P film, but the three leads and the accomplished supporting cast assembled here make this one of their very best, complex and thought-provoking efforts that looks fantastic on a big screen."

It is set in the home of an elderly couple whose grown up son and daughter - and their own respective families - are coming for a reunion dinner in order to commemorate the drowning of their eldest son some years earlier when he was a youth. Whilst there is the traditional deference you'd expect from children to parents, it soon becomes clear that the mother - especially - is no stickler for protocol, and her questioning of her son and his wife (whose own relationship is at times quite strained) about their own baby plans soon leads us to further exploration of all the aspirations and demons of those gathered around the table. It has been probably twenty years since my family had any sort of cross-generational repast, and there are certainly parts of this that ring true as the personalities of all concerned - even the youngsters - start to impose themselves on the ordinarily structured lives of all gathered together. That brings an authenticity to the scenario. There are no fights, tantrums, or squabbles - but it is clear from our observations that there are soft, vulnerable, points in each of their characters and that all of them are looking to the future in differing (and shorter-term) ways. Kirin Kiki - the mother - probably steals this for me, but the remainder of the ensemble cast deliver a touching, challenging and personal story with surety and delicacy. That's not to say this is in any way soporific, or slow - it isn't; it just allows the story to breathe and for us to appreciate the carefully crafted characterisations as the forty-eight hours, or so, of the visit unfolds. A slow burn - definitely - but well worth watching."

The main character Jo had spunk and a quick tongue, neither of them are a bad thing, though I got a little tired of her woe is me attitude, especially where her mother was concerned. Clearly her mother put herself first when it came to choosing and giving preference to low life men, but she also showed at times that she loved Jo, who probably could have helped her own cause by not being such a royal pain the the butt in nearly every interaction with her. She could count her blessings: her classmates seemed to like her, she had a decent boss in her new job, and a new ally when she met Geoffrey, who she she also moped and complained to a lot of the time.\r\n\r\nTo my ear, the soundtrack seems wildly inappropriate at times, not fitting in with my sense of the scenes, but it perhaps reflects the interests in music of the early 60s.

Very pleasant.\r\n\r\nDr. John Holden arrives in England to attend a paranormal convention where the recently deceased Professor Harrington had intended to expose Dr. Julian Karswell as being the leader of satanic cult. Upon learning of Harrington's death, Holden finds that the only link to the mysterious death and Karswell's alleged cult is an accused murderer called Rand Hobart, who is currently in a catatonic state. While Harrington's niece Joanna is convinced her uncle was felled by supernatural forces, Holden sets about debunking it all as pure hogwash. Something that may yet prove to be fatal to his well being?\r\n\r\nPrior to 1957, director Jacques Tourneur could boast on his résumé psychological horror classics I Walked With A Zombie & Cat People, the simmering pot boiling Western Canyon Passage and the rightly heralded film-noir piece that is Out Of The Past. He was in short the perfect choice to direct this loose adaptation of M.R. James' story \"Casting the Runes\". Why then? That producer Hal E. Chester chose to interfere and not let Tourneur have full rein to deliver a supernatural picture that is more about what you don't see is actually what scares you? Is open for scornful debate.\r\n\r\nThe problem, and the source of much discussion over the years, concerns the demon of the title. Goofy looking and at once taking away the quizzical factor for the audience, Chester had the demon appear both at the beginning and the end of the piece. It was also featured heavily in the film's advertising material (it's on the poster for instance), which quite frankly killed off the minuscule chance the less than scary vision had of shocking the audience. It's now all the years later considered across the board that it would have been better to not have seen the demon at all, certainly at the least to not see it at the beginning of the film.\r\n\r\nThankfully though, and with much credit to Tourneur, his team and the cast, Night Of The Demon is still a nerve pulling piece of work that shines bright today as a true classic horror picture. After the demon has shown its unremarkable face, we follow Holden (a knowingly effective and stoic turn from Dana Andrews) as he delves deeper into murky waters that he's convinced do not exist. Only to realise he's in a devilish trap laid by the creepy Karswell (Niall MacGinnis), a trap from which he must escape or face the dire consequence.\r\n\r\nThe tension has been built up beautifully by Tourneur, tension given an added dimension by Ken Adam's spookily adroit set designs. So come the glorious train station finale, nobody can be quite sure what will happen, and this in spite of us knowing the existence of the said demon thanks to the appearance of \"it\" at the beginning. The film was cut by 12 minutes and retitled Curse Of the Demon for the American market, but both versions have readily been available in disc form in the US. Odd then that in the country where the film is proudly called one of its own better horror entries, it had to wait till 2010 for a home disc release! That is almost as criminal as Chester's insistence on the demon appearing at the start of the film. Only almost mind you. 9/10"

        "content": "Well over one hundred years ago, Thomas Hardy experienced critical backlash against his novel \"Jude the Obscure\" and never wrote another novel. This film version is also controversial, but definitely worth a look. This stars Christopher Eccleston in the title role as a stonemason who yearns for higher learning and a better life. Eccleston's portrayal of Jude is excellent in that he is no Hollywood pretty boy. His ears are too big and his face sallow, but his expressions and gaunt look help his performance immensely, especially in the latter half of the film. Too bad the audience is left in the dark about what exactly makes his character tick. Jude's cousin, Sue, is played by Kate Winslet. She brings a professionalism to her role that almost overshadows Eccleston. Every nuance of her work here does not seem calculated, but very natural. Jude's wife, Arabella, who leaves him, but keeps popping back into his life over and over again, is played by Rachel Griffiths. Her character is a major flaw in the film. Gothicism was fading in the time this novel was written; readers were experiencing more realistic situations in novels by the likes of Charles Dickens, or fantastic situations in novels by H.G. Wells. Arabella seems old hat in a period film. When she is introduced, the scene is full of sunshine and Utopian bliss. Throughout the film, she appears in black widow's wear, striking a contrast against gray backgrounds and the forced happiness of Jude and Sue. This role screamed for a more intense actress along the lines of Nicole Kidman or Emily Watson. Griffiths does not have the presence needed. Any other actress would have taken the part and sunk her teeth into it, but Griffiths comes across as a pitiful old maid without a thought in her head. In the beginning of the film, in her cutesy courtship with Jude, another actress may have appeared whimsical and innocent, Griffiths plays Arabella like a moron. The director is well known in British and art house circles. His direction is expert, and different from other adaptations of long English novels. Winterbottom uses filmed captions to let the viewer know where Jude's travels take him. The film opens during Jude's childhood, and Winterbottom shoots the entire sequence in black and white, evoking antiquated romantic memories. The screenwriter, Hossein Amini, and Winterbottom load the film with too much sex, after a while it almost overshadows the plot and characters. The musical score and set design are marvelous and I would highly recommend this film to others, but maybe not as a study aid for Thomas Hardy-reading high school students. \"Jude\" has plenty of raw emotion, including the stinging fate of Sue and Jude's children, but Jude's character remains, pardon the pun, obscure. There is something great here, despite the flaws."

        "content": "***The Best Horror Flick about Hostile Worms Ever Made!***  \r\n\r\nAfter the incredible success of Jaws in 1975 \"nature runs amok\" flicks became real popular for the next decade or so; in fact, they're still being made. \"Squirm\" was released one year after \"Jaws\" in late July 1976 in the USA and most other countries in 1977-1978.\r\n\r\nTHE PLOT: A storm downs power lines in a coastal Georgia town, electrifying the wet mud and unleashing millions of 10-18 inch sand worms of the area. City slicker Mick (John Scardino) comes into town to visit redhead Geri (Patricia Pearcy), eldest daughter of a widow (Jean Sullivan). A slow-witted local hick Roger (R.A. Dow) is attacked by the worms and goes mad as slimy creatures attack the citizens over the course of a day and night. The opening claims that the events are based on an actual incident from September 29, 1975.\r\n\r\nThe first time I saw \"Squirm\" I was about 13 years old and high as a kite (something I don't do anymore) and, man, it scared the you-know-what out of me! I was completely taken in by the story, the eerie mood and Deep South ambiance. I was ENTRANCED. Seeing it again as an adult (and sober), it's understandably not as scary or captivating, but that first viewing won my utmost and eternal respect.\r\n\r\n\"Squirm\" was actually shot in the deep South, in Port Wentworth, Georgia (just North of Savannah), and all the actors go for the whole \"Southern\" bit with aplomb. So the film has a real authentic Southern feel.\r\n\r\nThe story is generally slow-paced but that's okay because the movie only runs 92 minutes. It has loads of atmosphere and a few really creepy scenes, like when the worms attack Roger's face while fishing in a rowboat with Geri. The story isn’t campy at all, as some claim, although there’s some realistic humor. It's pretty much presented in all seriousness; and the acting by the main characters is believable and good (not so much with the peripheral characters). Roger strikes you as a likable genuine country boy before the attack.\r\n\r\nAll of these factors explain how I was able to get swept up in the story and take it seriously (at least as serious as such a story can be taken). It may not be a Grade A film like \"Jaws\" or \"Orca\" but it's certainly a quality \"B\" film, that is, if you have a taste for \"nature runs amok\" flicks. Don't listen to those who say this is a Grade Z flick. It's not; it’s a well-made B picture.\r\n\r\nHow you will take \"Squirm\" depends on your personality. Some will find it unintentionally funny or cheesy, while others, like me, will take it seriously and enjoy the eerie air, Southern locations and a few good frights. \"Squirm\" is effective for the type of film it is. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

A large stagnant pond amidst their community is as likely to prove a source of toxicity as the pervading Yakuza activities. Those centre around \"Matsunaga\" (Toshirô Mifune) who turns up at the surgery with an injured hand. The doctor treats the wound but also suggest that the man might want to get treated for what he suspects is a case of tuberculosis. The two men fight - verbally and physically - and things continue to worsen when his boss \"Okada\" (Reizaburô Yamamoto) gets out of prison and starts to reassert his authority amongst the shopkeepers. Despite the initial hostility, Kurosawa manages to generate a considerable degree of amity between the two men as the story progresses. It is a friendship - of sorts - borne out of frustration and a desire to drink a great deal, and that dynamic becomes more engaging as the inevitability of parts of the story become ever clearer. There is some lovely guitar accompaniment to Fumio Hayasaka's score and the dialogue sparingly but convincingly guides us along as these two opposites start to attract. It is tightly paced with plenty of action as well as engendering, for me anyway, quite a degree of sympathy for the physician caught in a maelstrom of despair that is as much self-induced as anything."

However, it's in a similar vein to productions like <em>'The Cat in the Hat'</em> so always divides opinion. If you can find enjoyment, you'll obviously like it but otherwise you'll hate it. I'm under the former.\r\n\r\nThe cast help a lot. Riteish Deshmukh suits the role of Aladin, while Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjay Dutt are enjoyable as Genius and Jaffar. Despite the title/titular character, it's more so a film that refers to <em>'Aladdin'</em> rather than a remake/reimagining of the famous folk tale. I liked how they set this up, sure it is dumb but it works in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI did start getting bored towards the end, so the run time is most definitely too long - 90 minutes, as opposed to 132, would've been ideal.

The second scores points for featuring Peter Cushing and a really bizarre story, but the ending is a bit confused. The penultimate story is unique only for it's casting, the idea of seeing Britt Ekland as Charlotte Rampling's murderous alter-ego seems like it should be reversed. Some of the music is overdone to the point of absurdity, cue the robot Herbert Lom slowing making his way to a dumbwaiter accompanied by a bombastic score that makes every inch it travels like a knife in the ear."

The four stories center around Robert Powell's job seeking Dr. Martin. Whom upon arriving at the classy, yet foreboding looking Asylum (New Lodge, Winkfield, Berkshire, England), is required to interview the four patients up on the top floor so as to prove his credentials for the position. As with all anthology horror pictures, the stories vary in quality, but what is consistent though is that the atmosphere and mystery element to it all never flags. Atmosphere that is somewhat boosted by Douglas Gamley's impacting construction of Modest Mussorgsky's music.\r\n\r\n'Frozen Fear' sees a murdered wife come back to reek revenge on her husband and his lover. Not a bad trick since she was dismembered!.\r\n\r\n'The Weird Taylor' has Peter Cushing as a grieving father who will do anything to bring his deceased son back to life.\r\n\r\n'Lucy Comes to Stay' features Charlotte Rampling and Britt Eckland in a murderous spin on the \"imaginary friend\" angle.\r\n\r\n'Manikins of Horror' is the last story which stars Herbert Lom as a maker of little robotic dolls that have worryingly realistic faces.\r\n\r\nAll of which leads us to the finale where we get a nice and rewarding twist. It's a good production is this, the direction and writing is fluid and there are some genuinely creepy and unsettling moments.

My favourite of the four stories features Peter Cushing as a tailor tasked with making a suit from a particularly pliable material, but the others are interesting too with their fair share of voodoo, nasty dolls and some good old family enmity. The narrative is structured well, with each story engagingly self-contained within the asylum environment. Keep an eye out for Charlotte Rampling, and an ear on the rather effective Douglas Gamley score that does much of the heavy lifting required to compensate for some pretty ropey dialogue at times. Made in 1972, I wonder if it might have been more effective had it been a few years earlier, with the additional atmospheric benefits of monochrome?"

When soldiers start mysteriously dying, it draws a ruthless Nazi commander into the fray (Gabriel Byrne), as well as a Hebrew professor and his daughter (Ian McKellen & Alberta Watson). A strange nomad is also attracted to the proceedings (Scott Glenn).  \r\n\r\nBased on the 1981 book of the same name, \"The Keep\" (1983) is a supernatural thriller set in WW2, one of director Michael Mann’s early flicks before his great success with films like “The Last of the Mohicans” (1992). While this was a flop at the box office, it has since developed a cult following. It was no cheapo movie, costing a whopping $11 million at the time and hence has quality production values, especially for an early 80’s horror flick. It’s comparable to a late-era Hammer movie, just made on a huge budget and without Cushing or Lee.\r\n\r\nThere are elements of “Altered States” (1980), “The Formula” (1980), “The Seventh Sign” (1988) and “Howling V: The Rebirth” (1989) so, if you like those films, check it out (and, yes, I realize those last two came out 5-6 years later).\r\n\r\nThe production was troubled with Mann’s original edit being 3.5 hours, which is well over TWICE as long as the version released to theaters (!). This has caused critics to denounce “The Keep” as a jaggedly-edited outlandish mess that attempts to be an art film, a horror flick and a WW2 movie without really succeeding at any. The film’s peculiarity is augmented by a dream-like score by Tangerine Dream. Nevertheless, there’s enough good here to entertain open-minded viewers. While there are obvious cut parts, the story isn’t hard to fill-in the blanks.\r\n\r\nThere is a creature and it’s easily the most intriguing part (in later scenes it sorta rips-off of Jack Kirby’s Darkseid). Yet I found the characters played by Prochnow, Byrne and McKellen interesting too. \r\n\r\nScott Glenn’s role would’ve been better if he was fleshed out more. He was the protagonist of the book, but his scenes were cut. What we are left with is an enigmatic traveler with glowing eyeballs and a magic stick who has no qualms about jumping into bed with a woman he barely knows (in defense of this sequence, he instinctively KNOWS her and vice versa to a degree). \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Blaenau Ffestiniog & Llanberis in northwestern Wales, as well as England at Shepperton Studios, just west of London, and Kent (the concentration camp); with Spain standing in for Greece in one scene. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

Unbeknown to them, though, the outwardly affable Christie lives a double life. His other \"career\" is to help unfortunate women deal with ailments for which they cannot just go to their doctor. We assume that he gets his kicks whilst they are anaethetised and then they end up behind a false wall in his kitchen! It transpires that he might just be able to help the poverty stricken Evans's out - they cannot afford the child they already have, let along bring another into the world, and their rows are regularly heard by the entire street! Maybe Christie has a solution? Of course, by this stage we are fully aware of the real motives behind this proposed \"generosity\" and clearly it is all very perilous for Beryl, and quite possibly for her slightly flaky husband too. This story had a profound effect on the British public in 1949, when all this happened, and may well have hastened the abolition of the death penalty some 15 years later. The potent performances here make it very easy to see why. So often the victims were never reported missing, or if they were there was no connection to Christie as few of them ever told anyone else where they were going, or why! The truth only came to light after he had been evicted for unlawfully sub-letting their flat. It's a tough watch, this. Richard Fleischer doesn't offer us graphic imagery or audio, he allows our own well informed imagination to do most of the heavy lifting here, and that technique really works!"

(1948) and John Carradine Female Jungle (1954), Bluebeard (1944)\r\n\r\nThe film begins with a car speeding down the road with the credits zipping by as super-imposed street signs. The camera pulls back and it’s revealed that it’s a bus. Dana Andrews gets pulled off the bus because he doesn’t have enough cash to get to San Francisco. (he’s about 150 miles short). He walks over to Pop’s Eats (now a noir icon with those great “BEER” signs out front) and he runs into a group of men looking for the waitress Stella. Apparently every man in town has a crush on her. So begins a twisted tale of Eric Stanton – a former New York press agent down on his luck so much that now he's a drifter (and he'll soon be a con man). After Stella returns (the sexy Linda Darnell) to the diner (to the relief of Pops and others) Stanton cons his way into an empty hotel room to sleep. Its professor Madley (the great John Carradine) and his assistant’s room and Stanton talks his way into helping them get their show publicized. Madley is a traveling soothsayer grifter. When Stanton hooks up with Madley and his spook act he meets Clara and June Mills (Anne Revere and Alice Faye) two suckers Madley wants to take.\r\n\r\nMadley puts on a very entertaining séance by bringing up the finances of the late Abraham Mills – the father of Clara and June. The two leave the séance upset.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Stanton falls in love with Stella. She’s as bad as Stanton. She likes to take money from Pop’s cash register. After a quick romance Stanton decides he wants her. She refuses to marry him because of his poor financial condition. Desperate for money, Eric marries the wealthy local spinster June Mills, whom he plans to quickly divorce. Clara sees through the scam but is unable to stop the romance. Stanton can’t stay away from Stella even on his wedding night. Instead of sleeping with his wife, he visits Stella.\r\n\r\nJust as he's about to dump his new wife, Stella turns up dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMark Judd (Charles Bickford), a hard-bitten ex-cop turned detective, investigates the murder that first leads to one of Stella’s ex-boyfriends and after a police-style beating of the suspect finally leads to Stanton.\r\n\r\nStanton flees to a seedy hotel room in San Francisco, with June at his side. He quickly abandons her after taking her money, but he returns when word reaches him that June has been charged with Stella's murder.\r\n\r\nI won’t give away the ending but its fun.\r\n\r\nI think Preminger didn’t have chops of other, more talented, noir directors (as far as visual style goes), but this film - with all the fluid camera movements - looks great. Joseph LaShelle (The cinematographer for Laura) does his usual excellent work. The film’s shadowy world is just right. As with all Preminger films, the women look fantastic. Notice Stella’s long legs when she first comes back to Pop’s. From what I’ve read online, most don’t buy the prim and proper Alice Faye or the crazy twists at the end of the film. I, however, enjoy it greatly maybe because of the constant broken desperation Stanton is in. I also enjoy the contrast between the night-time Stella and the sunny day June; and the seedy side of town compared with June’s suburban neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWritten by Steve-O"

Seen as something of a lesser entry in film noir and on Preminger's CV (he claimed to not even remembering the film when quizzed about it once!), the piece is famous for being the last film Faye made as a major Hollywood actress. Disappointed at how studio boss Darryl F. Zanuck and Preminger cut her role out of the picture (they were all about Darnell), Faye left the studio the day after a preview screening, and did not make another film for 16 years.\r\n\r\nThe plot sees Andrews as press agent Eric Stanton, who down on his luck gets turfed off the bus some 150 miles from San Francisco and finds that he is in the small coastal town of Walton. Here he meets sultry waitress Stella (Darnell) and frumpy recluse June (Faye). The former he is very attracted too, so is everybody else it seems, the latter has just come into a lot of inheritance money, something else that catches Eric's eye. Pretty soon his life will be surrounded by love, infatuation, jealousy and worst of all - murder.\r\n\r\nMore a mystery whodunit than an overtly dark venture into the realm of film noir, Fallen Angel is still a tidy and atmospheric movie. One where we can never be fully sure everything is as it at first seems. Especially the three main protagonists, where Preminger, in spite of not remembering doing so, misdirects the audience about the character's make ups. This greatly aids the whodunit structure where the killer is well disguised until the end reveal. Its also nicely shot by LaShelle, where the lighting is key for scenes involving the more vixen like Darnell and the more homely Faye, the difference, and what it says, is quite striking. It be a nice narrative line to follow on revisits to the film. \r\n\r\nThe acting is safe, with Darnell leaving the red blooded men amongst us happy and wanting more. And in spite of some uneven threading of the plot in the last quarter, the end is a triumph and a genuine surprise. 7/10\r\n\r\nFootnote: The source novel the movie was adapted from was written by Marty Holland. Also the author of \"The File on Thelma Jordan\" (1949), Marty was actually a she named Mary, of who little or nothing else is known about because after 1949 she upped and vanished never to be heard of again!"

He is chucked off a Greyhound bus (by a driver who looked remarkably like Ward Bond) in a sleepy coastal town, where he heads to a local diner to plan how best to continue his journey on to San Francisco. His plans change suddenly, however, when he meets the rather venal waitress \"Stella\" (Linda Darnell) even though she is pretty lukewarm to his subtleties. This little town seems to attract charlatans as also he encounters \"Madley\" (John Carradine) and the pair hatch a plan to procure a considerable sum of money from a couple of wealthy young sisters, the younger of whom \"June\" (Alice Faye) succumbs to his strategy and marries him. All looks set fair until \"Stella\" (remember her?) turns up - dead - and the other sister \"Clara\" (Anne Revere) who has a bit of history when it comes to being fleeced by con-artists is now bent on ensuring that \"Eric\" is a focus for the murder investigation. The plot is just a touch convoluted; the murder investigation almost irrelevant, but Otto Preminger builds the tension efficiently as the cocky young man finds these locals he assumed were easy prey turn out to be somewhat more canny - and vindictive. I wasn't hugely impressed with the ending, but the performances - especially from Andrews and Revere are strong with some decent dialogue and romance kept to a minimum."

On a lark, he trades places with an amusing man of low status (Will Hutchins) to see if he can find a woman who loves him just for himself rather than for his wealth. Shelley Fabares plays his love interest, Bill Bixby his rival and Gary Merrill a boat entrepreneur.   \r\n\r\n“Clambake” (1967) was Elvis’ 25th movie and he would only do six more before leaving cinema for good. After the release of this film he only had 10 more years to live.\r\n\r\nIt’s a fun flick and shows that not all of his late 60’s movies sucked. While it’s not on the level of “Blue Hawaii” (1961), \"Kid Galahad\" (1962), “Roustabout” (1964) and “Viva Las Vegas\" (1964), it’s entertaining as an innocuous half-serious, half-campy drama/musical. It’s certainly more compelling than “Fun in Acapulco” (1963), “Kissin’ Cousins” (1964) and “Spinout” (1966). \r\n\r\nElvis’ sidekick Will Hutchins helps make this one so fun and it’s always good to see Bixby and Merrill. Meanwhile Fabares is winsome, but too shapeless to hold my interest. On that note, there are several notable women in the periphery, like Angelique Pettyjohn and Marj Dusay. \r\n\r\nThe clambake song & dance scene is a highlight in a swinging 60’s way; it’s just all-around well done and iconic of the era. The playground sequence with the kids and the quirky song \"Confidence\" is cute and warmhearted.\r\n\r\nElvis started to struggle with his weight around this time and wasn’t happy about doing musical fluff when he wanted to do more serious stuff. To add insult to injury, the less-than-stellar performance at the box office ensured that this was the last movie he could insist on his $1 million price tag. Despite all this, Elvis looked bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. There’s no doubt he still had his charisma.     \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, with the second-unit scenes shot in Miami, the Florida Keys & the Everglades, Florida, while all the Elvis scenes were done at Universal Studios & Van Nuys, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/B"

No Kenneth Williams for this one, but a point of interest is that Robin Askwith appears for the only time. Askwith ironically would become the star of the \"Confessions\" series of film's which would take the sex comedy to a whole new plateau from 1974 onwards. Carry On Girls has its moments, Bernie Bresslaw in drag brings quite a few gags, while Peter Butterworth as a lecherous old man steals the film.\r\n\r\nAlso pleasing for the franchise faithful is that the Sid James and Barbara Windsor (Hope Springs) pairing gets a nice arc befitting the relationship the pair built up during the series. Beauty contests and feminist whiles are given the treatment in Talbot Rothwell's screenplay, and the dying seaside town in need of a boost has a certain warmth to it (filmed on location in Brighton on England's South Coast).

In fact, I understand the motivations of those who say this: the film is not good, it is not one of those films that I feel I will want to review a lot, however it is effective and gives us what it promises, in an honest way.\r\n\r\nThe script also has its originality, although it is scarce and only sustains a feature film thanks to the ability of the director, the \"newbie\" Stan Winston, to stretch it, albeit at the expense of a slower pace, which he tried to take advantage of to create Suspense: Set in an isolated rural area, the film is an insane revenge story, in which a man decides to turn to an evil witch after having his young son killed in an accident by a group of unconscious teenagers.\r\n\r\nThe actors are, for me, illustrious strangers. However, I really liked the performance of Lance Henrikssen, who is the only actor here to maintain a dramatic posture, to have charisma and to develop a more professional and mature work. In addition to giving life to the anguished father, he also gave life and body to the monster, who is the true protagonist of this film. The film also has several other actors, most of them quite young and with little experience.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, I would like to highlight, first of all, the painstaking and time-consuming work of characterizing Henrikssen whenever he brought the monster to life. I can only imagine all the time spent each time the actor had to masquerade like that, and that disguise was excellent in itself, truly frightening and detailed. The filming work and cinematography seemed to be regular, the sets were well executed and the visual, special and sound effects are well done, especially considering the reduced budget of the production. The soundtrack also proved to be effective, albeit forgettable."

Yet this is no torture porn picture, the gore is minimum and this for sure is not a slasher type of film either. It’s a slice of mental cruelty mixed with a damaged seed, two bad aspects of human nature crashing together to assault those interested in the psychologically based splinter of horror.\r\n\r\nOh and the ending is a cracker-jack, guaranteed to jolt you, for better or worse! 7.5/10"

The first half of the picture plays heavy on the fact that the new Mrs Ford only speaks Italian, this sets us up for a number of funny sequences, particularly when Claire Trevor enters the fray as Edna, but on it goes, and on it goes... We then get to watch as Stanley gains weight due to Mrs Ford's willingness to cook for her new husband, with Lemmon reduced to playing Stanley as an exasperated buffoon, henpecked within an inch of his manhood.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the picture, as the title suggests, sees Stanley grow a spine and decide to deal with his problem by killing the wife. You would think that this sets the picture up for a number of riotous sequences as Stanley tries to do away with her, but sadly no, it's just the one joke that fails to light up the picture in any shape or form. The run in to the finale is marginally saved by the always reliable Eddie Mayehoff, but come the credits you wonder if the film ever meant to be a full blown comedy in the first place? 4/10 for Mayehoff and Terry-Thomas' opening scenes."

The cast of females is decent, with Rumer Willis (Ellie), Briana Evigan (Cassidy) and Caroline D'Amore (Maggie) standing out (Audrina Patridge’s role is too small to note), but the wannabe edgy tone makes it hard to warm up to any of them.

It's written by Ernest Kinoy and Drake Walker and joining Poitier in the cast are Harry Belafonte, Ruby Dee and Cameron Miller. Music is by Benny Carter, with notable contributions from Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, and cinematography is by Alex Phillips Jr.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War was over and by law the slaves were freed. But when the promise of land and freedom was not honoured, many ex-slaves journeyed out of the land of bondage in search of new frontiers where they could be free at last.\r\n\r\nThey placed their hopes in the hands of the few wagon masters that knew the territories of the West.\r\n\r\nNone of this came easy, for not only did they have to overcome a hostile wilderness, but night-riders and bounty hunters were hired by \"persons unknown\" to hunt them down and turn them back to to the fields.\r\n\r\nThis picture is dedicated to those men, women and children who lie in graves as unmarked as their place in history.\r\n\r\nQuite an opening statement that, a real attention grabber, then the throat grabbing ups still further as we land in a camp of African Americans, freed from slavery, ready to travel West for a better life. This harmony is shattered by the arrival of a night-rider gang led by DeShay (Miller), who promptly murder anyone who moves, not even the swine and poultry are spared. As the camp burns and the distaste in the throat refuses to leave, we feel we are in for something special with Poitier's directing debut, a peek at a part of history rarely shown in the movies.\r\n\r\nSadly the film never hits these heights again.... \r\n\r\nIn some ways it feels like kicking a man when he is down, for Buck and the Preacher is well directed, very well acted, expertly photographed by Phillips (Durango, Mexico and Kenya standing in for Kansas Territory) and features a very untraditional, but pleasing, score by jazz man Carter and blues men Terry & McGhee. But Kinoy (Roots) and Walker have failed Poitier in the writing, badly trying to blend off beat comedy with serious racial thematics, while what little action takes place after that barn storming opening, starts to feel off kilter with the slow pace of the picture.\r\n\r\nSuch a shame, I mean who better to direct and star in such a thematically potent piece than the graceful Poitier? With Belafonte providing great chemistry as well, whilst gleefully stealing the film from his more illustrious acting brother, there's still much for the Western fan to feast on here. There's the unusual but much appreciated sight of the Indians painted as saviours, a dignified and intelligent race riding in cavalry style, the chief (Enrique Lucero) negotiating with Buck (Poitier) like a royal master of his creed. But this ultimately ends up as not being all that it should be.\r\n\r\nI'd urge Western fans to see it, but I can't guarantee you wont be frustrated come the end credits. 6/10"

Now there are those who don't much like this relocation plan, and the \"DeShay\" gang are employed by the southern cotton farmers to try to ensure that their erstwhile property never survive the trip. It's one such altercation that sees \"Buck\" - trying to stay alive - swap horses with a preacher (Harry Belafonte) who just happened to be bathing in a stream nearby. The gang now follow the wrong horse only for their leader (Cameron Mitchell) to convince the preacher that he will pay him $500 for \"Buck\" and that it'd be in his interests to help send the slaves back to their former masters, too. Swiftly, he sets off on the trail of his quarry, but when he realises that \"Buck\" is actually quite a decent soul who genuinely wants to help his clients achieve their new opportunities without upsetting the balance between the native Indians and the buffalo, the two decide to unite and plan their own form of revenge. The thing has a degree of predictability about it that rather drags it down, even if the story does highlight the fact that victory in war wasn't necessarily a victory for freedom. The cinematography is grand and there is plenty of action, but somehow the film just never caught fire for me. Neither man came across as especially convincing and Mitchell just underwhelmed as a baddie. I suppose the days of the Western as a genre were coming to an end and though the underlying message of continuing fear and exploitation is clear and important, the film itself, despite quite an entertaining denouement, is maybe trying a bit too hard."

It stars Sam Elliott, Tom Conti, Kate Capshaw, Kenny Morrison, Matt Clark and Patrick Kilpatrick. Music is by Steve Dorff and cinematography is by Dick Bush.  \r\n\r\nIn 1876 Wyoming, Duncan (Conti) and Suzanna McKaskel (Capshaw) are taking their son and belongings to start a new life out West. But driving through a barely populated tin-pot town, they find themselves beset by a bunch of outlaws run by Doc Shabitt (Clark). Luckily, help may be at hand in the form of tough no nonsense frontiersman Con Vallian (Elliott)?, that is if matters of the heart and secrets of the past do not confuse the issues to hand...\r\n\r\nHow nice it is as a big Western fan to find a television  movie that shines bright in genre light. This is wonderfully old fashioned in its setting and telling, simple in plot structure it may be, but pretty much everything falls into place for a pic that for genre fans becomes more than just a time waster. \r\n\r\nElliott's calm rugged swagger is in full effect, Capshaw is splendidly tender yet stoic, and much to my surprise Conti proves more than capable as a Western hero in waiting - where his character's back story comes to make sense of the final quarter. The villains are a bit rote, with the usually reliable Kilpatrick barely passable as a rogue Ute Native American, while the child performance of Morrison is hardly a high point.\r\n\r\nHowever, pic is set 99.9% outdoors, where we get an absolute ream of glorious Arizona locales to cloak the characters. It has shades of \"Shane\", which is no bad thing, and thankfully the finale - though not unexpected - is worth waiting for. 7/10"

Vallian's desire is piqued by the wife (Kate Capshaw), is that interest mutual? Will the family make it to the Bighorn Mountains alive-and-well or will violence and adultery destroy them?\r\n\r\nIf you don't remember Kate Capshaw, she was the blonde in 1984's \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" and later married director Steven Spielberg.\r\n\r\nI was impressed with this little-known Western. Although made for cable, it's based on a Louis L'Armour book and is actually better than some theatrically released Westerns. There are flaws, like the kid's questionable acting skills and the fact that the film was noticeably shot in Northern Arizona rather than Eastern Wyoming, but -- all things considered -- this is a solid realistic Western in the tradition of \"Shane\" and \"Will Penny.\" Don't expect the mythic tone of 1995's big-budget Western of the same name.\r\n\r\nHighlights include the breathtaking cinematography, a believable and mature approach, Kate's beauty, a hackneyed plot redeemed by quality characters (like Tom Conti as the settler husband/father), insightful drama & plot surprises and, of course, Sam Elliott as the quintessential Westerner. Really, Elliott is as good or – more likely – better than any Western icon you care to name (Wayne, Eastwood, Cooper, Scott, Stewart, Costner, etc.).\r\n\r\nThere are mature and insightful themes, like the undeniable connection of Vallian and Susanna. Most of us can relate: You stumble across someone of the opposite sex and instinctively sense a palpable connection, some kind of profound mutual fascination, yet — for whatever reason — pursuing an intimate relationship is not an option. In an entire lifetime you will only experience a handful such 'connections,' or less. These exchanges are permanent because they are so potent they are forever burned into one's psyche.\r\n\r\n\"The Quick and the Dead\" may not be a top-notch Western like \"Dances With Wolves\" or \"The Outlaw Josey Wales,\" but it's certainly a quality Western and well worth your time.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 91 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

Wolfgang Preiss is quite effective as his pursuing Nazi \"von Haller\" exuding just a hint of menace and Michael J. Pollard pulls some quite comical stunts as escaping American \"Packy\" who turns his hand to sabotage at times... Aside from the affable humour, I also remembered the lightly orchestral score from Francis Lai - a memorable little theme that, as they wander through some gorgeous Germany scenery sets this up nicely.

Do It With Thy Might.\r\n\r\nOdds Against Tomorrow is directed by Robert Wise and adapted to screenplay by Abraham Polonsky and Nelson Gidding from the novel written by William P. McGivern. It stars Harry Belafonte, Robert Ryan, Ed Begley, Shelley Winters and Gloria Grahame. Music is by John Lewis and cinematography by Joseph C. Brun. \r\n\r\nDon't beat on that Civil War jazz here Slater. We are all in this together - each man equal. And we're taking care of each other, it's one big play, our one and only chance to grab sticks forever. And I don't wanna hear bout what your Grandpappy thought on the old farm down on old Oklahoma. You got it? \r\n\r\nA seething ball of fatalism, pessimism and racism, Odds Against Tomorrow packs a firm handed noir punch. At the core it's a tale of 3 men doing a heist, each man with their own reasons for breaking the law, to tackle what looks to be a simple job. Begley is a bitter ex-cop, Ryan a loser living off of his girlfriend, and Belafonte likes to gamble on the horses, only he's not very good at it and now his financial provider wants cashing in - or there are bigger prices to be paid... \r\n\r\nAll men are evil. \r\n\r\nWise is in no hurry here, he builds the characters and inner turmoil of each protagonist for a good portion of the running time. It's a good move. The racial tension is palpable, Earle Slater (Ryan) is a venomous racist, which obviously doesn't go down too well with Johnny Ingram (Belafonte), their scenes together crackle with electric tinged hatred, which in turn gives the whole pic its ism factors. It's bitter stuff, further compounded by the two femmes of the piece, both of whom are attached to Slater. They are not fatale types, but Lorry (Winters) and Helen (Grahame) are sad cases for differing reasons, both adding to the all round sourness of the narrative, with Helen's key scene with Slater containing razor edged scripting. \r\n\r\nHello dear! \r\n\r\nThe makers fill out the pic with an array of noir standards, from gay henchmen, facially blemished bystanders and acerbic dialogue, to a whole bunch of scenes and imagery that linger large. Daylight scenes have a threatening hue to them, most often boosted by crafty images such as deflated balloons, a battered doll, a rusty old tin can, a dizzying carousel or even a serene shot of a rabbit caught in the sights of our most hate filled protag. Brun's night photography out in the streets is rich with oppressive and ominous atmosphere, and the interior environments of a cramped apartment (scary stairs outside of course) and a smoky club (hello percussion abuse!) are ripe with a claustrophobic hopelessness befitting the story. And all the time John Lewis lays some sumptuously moody jazz over everything. \r\n\r\nIt all builds to the big finale, the heist and the heart tugs, a welcome to noirville sign going blink blink blinkity blink somewhere in the shadowed city. The message is clear, and every lover of film noir owes Robert Wise a debt of gratitude for overseeing a change of endings from the literary source. Yes, even the director of two of the most popular musicals of all time could beat a black heart. Thank you Bobby. 9/10"

He has two accomplices in mind. The first is the dapper, debonaire \"Ingram\" (Harry Belafonte), the latter the grittier \"Slater\" (Robert Ryan). Initially, neither are interested in his scheme but \"Burke\" knows which buttons to press, and soon the three are planning the daring heist. To be honest, the plot itself is really nothing special. It's the three leading performances that make this stand out. The racial tensions between \"Slater\" and \"Ingram\" are palpable and as the story develops, it's clear that they are just as likely to shoot the other as they are to co-operate in the robbery. That gradually accumulating mistrust and open hostility is well presented by Robert Wise as the denouement looms (admittedly, with a certain degree of predictability) and things come to an head. I never found Ryan to be a particularly versatile actor - but here his is perfectly cast, generating a malevolence that speaks volumes about attitudes in the USA in the late 1950s. Gloria Grahame makes the briefest of supporting appearances, as does Shelley Winters - and they both serve to allow the pot to reduce to a simmer rather than boil over - even if we know that boil over it must. This is a solidly paced and well scripted characterful study of the venality and bigotry of human nature that is still well worth a watch."

It stars Glenn Corbett, James Shigeta, Victoria Shaw & Anna Lee. Cinematographer is Sam Leavitt and the music is by Harry Sukman. Plot is about two L.A. cops, Joe Kojaku (Shigeta) & Charlie Bancroft (Corbett), deep friends of a different race, bonded by blood who met during the Korean War. When stripper Sugar Torch (Gloria Pall) is shot and killed, the two men's investigation sees them follow a painting to the artist who painted it, Christine Downes (Shaw). It's the start of a love triangle that could have far reaching consequences for not only the investigation, but also Joe, Charlie & Christine.\r\n\r\n1959 saw the release of Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life, a much talked about movie, that whilst splitting the critics down the middle, was none the less the fourth biggest earner at the box office that year. Sirk's film, amongst other things, had a racially charged thread in it that gave it some added potency. The Crimson Kimono also had a racially charged thread running thru it, but Samuel Fuller's film, it seems, slipped under the radar. Now of course in the modern era of film, Sam Fuller is often name checked by the likes Scorsese & Tarantino as being an influence, while the French New Wavers were quick to laud him as a stylistic influence too. The Crimson Kimono is far from being Fuller's best work, but it is unmistakably a Fuller movie, and one that is a must see for those of a noir/hard-boiled persuasion.\r\n\r\nFuller has managed to put a murder mystery at the core of his film and wrap around it a tale of inter-racial tolerance, jealousy and sexual confusion: set deliciously to the backdrops of an urban part of L.A. and the more cosmopolitan Little Tokyo. As he weaves his vision together, never once hitting the viewer over the head with its messages, Fuller neatly plays around with his camera. Up close and personal to his actors, sweeping alongside for walk sequences and scatter-gun shooting for his action scenes (a Kendo fight is an action high point). It's thoughtful film making, the camera puts us in with the story and no scene is wasted, it's all relative, particularly as tensions start to rise between the two best friends and the case starts to unfold.\r\n\r\nThe principal actors are not big names, but all are very credible, and the lack of star power actually benefits the piece by keeping the narrative grounded. While the supporting Anna Lee (How Green Was My Valley) as an alcoholic mother figure type is a joy to watch. Sam Leavitt's (Anatomy of a Murder/The Defiant Ones) photography has it just right, the black & white has a stark look for the street exteriors and the interior focus has that hue of character importance about it. Harry Sukman's music is also worthy of mentioning, blending jazzy beats with oriental flavors, it's well in keeping with the nature of the story.\r\n\r\nAlthough there's no cop out in the finale, in fact it's an important and affecting finish as regards the characters, the murder mystery angle close down is a little unfulfilling in context to the mood that has overall been built up. But it's no deal breaker and doesn't detract from what a very good movie The Crimson Kimono is. 8/10"

Now, I might be somewhat biased on this particular subject, because I am a huge fan of 70's (punk)rock, and especially female rock artists, but I am also a very critical film reviewer. The Runaways therefore, leaves me feeling in limbo.\r\n\r\nI love musical biopics as much as I love the music itself, and since The Runaways falls exactly into my favourite genre of music, I thought this film would be nothing other than a win-win flick for me. However, I felt rather quickly discouraged from the build-up on. When you are telling a true-to-life story, I consider it an important issue to let the audience know who we're dealing with, what's going on and perhaps most importantly, why. These are real people and I want to know why they are who they are, and what motivated them to walk their chosen path in life. The film starts off with alternating scenes of Joan Jett and her soon to be band mate Cherie Currie. Doing stuff that, well... isn't that interesting. It doesn't tell us much about these girls except that they like punk rock and David Bowie. Honestly, having only seen the film last night, it's all I can remember about the first 15 minutes or so. And so the film continues.\r\n\r\nThey form a band, are taken under the wing of weirdo record producer/manager Kim Fowley, become famous and at some point, break up. The way director Floria Sigismondi tells the story, you'd think it was actually that easy. And this is exactly where the problem lies: bad direction. Possibly even worse editing and screenplay. We are given almost zero back-story of the lives of these young girls, and strangely, literally nothing at all about the personal life of Joan Jett. What makes it even stranger is the fact that the real Joan Jett was actually executive producer of this film, which completely puzzles me considering her part was so badly written. Her character comes across as not much more than a bystander in her own story.\r\n\r\nAt least we're offered snippets of information about Cherie Currie. We know that she comes from an instable family and that her sister (who is in fact her twin – something I had to learn from Wikipedia since it's never told in the film...) is the only one she is at least somewhat close to. Again though, strangely, what is never told here is that this girl was raped when she was 14 – an incident which strongly determined the person she would become later on. Very weird to leave out of a biopic.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that the rest of the band didn't give permission for their life story to be used in the film, and it shows. On the one hand, it's a shame because the back-story of the band is already so badly underexposed. On the other, I can't blame them, because this film would have done them no justice whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe story of The Runaways is told as though it all happened overnight: formation, fame, break-up; in what feels like no more than a short year maybe. When in fact they released four albums, three of which with Cherie. Truly awful screenplay.\r\n\r\nThe actors though, are not at all to blame. Kristen Stewart embodies Joan Jett perfectly, she's got the looks, the voice (she sings all her parts herself) and the swagger. Dakota Fanning as Cherie does a very good job also. Although she may not look or sound that much like the real Cherie Currie, her acting more than makes up for it. But then again, anyone who's seen Dakota before, whether as a child actor or teenager, already knows she's a very convincing young actress. The rest of the band, much like their characters, are barely there to be noticed...\r\n\r\nThe part of Kim Fowley is played by Michael Shannon, and he approaches it with a \"love it or hate it\" attitude. Personally, I think he was an absolute scene-stealer (which is not necessarily a good thing, because obviously this film is not about him – though it is the direction that is to blame, not the actor), acting completely over the top, crude, and horribly inappropriate. Though I can see why some people absolutely hated his character. Simple: there is nothing likable about him. He's an a**hole, and a big one too. As an acting part however, it was obvious that Michael Shannon had a ball playing this guy, and I think that's what makes his role very enjoyable to watch.\r\n\r\nThe actors really do make up for a lot in The Runaways. All parts are equally well-played and very enjoyable. But when the technical aspects of a film are this poor, not even the best actors in the world can make it a success. Zero story, zero character development, shoddy editing and, worst of all, not enough music! Probably the stupidest thing about the whole film – you'd think that, in a film about The Runaways, there'd be more than two or three original Runaways songs! Yet we have to listen to \"Cherry Bomb\" over and over again, and we get only titbits of their other songs. Sheesh.\r\n\r\nThe Runaways may not have been the most groundbreaking band in history, but they certainly were a cool band of young rock chicks, and they deserved a better film than this one. I would say it's fun to watch once if you're into this kind of music, but that's it. Such a shame.\r\n_(February 2013)_"

A job is out here waiting to be done - maybe Roy's last one before finally finding love and straightening out? But Roy is finding out that this is a different world to the one he left behind, the one before he entered the Big House for his stretch. There are crooks he's not familiar with and women turning his head, hell even a canine has him at odds with his machismo sensibility, but all of it will come crashing together amongst the magnificent High Sierra!\r\n\r\nIt's a really funny thing now, you buy two DVDs and they both tell you that the respective film from 1941 is the breakout role for Humphrey Bogart. I am of course referring to both this fabulous film and the equally brilliant Maltese Falcon, what a double that is eh! Truth is, is that both films merely showcase what a talent the great man was, and crucially, that he could imbue his characters with terrific pathos and emotive drive. Here as Roy Earle Bogart gives one of his best 40s performances, this on a CV that has many other great turns. Made to look far more aged than he was (well done Perc Westmore), he manages to make Earle a tough and gritty man, yet at the same time he pulls the audience on side with a hardened professionalism that has us admiring the obvious qualities that reside deep within him.\r\n\r\nDirected by directing great Raoul Walsh, scripted by one John Huston, and starring Humphrey Bogart, it's obvious that this take on W.R. Burnett's novel is in safe hands. Playing out as one of the gangster genre's last hurrahs, it's clear to me that some future great Western directors were taking notes, for what drives High Sierra to being so gripping throughout is the man out of his time pulse beats, sensitivity seams through the picture without ever cloying the tension and feel of the pic. The best Adult Westerns coming in the next two decades would grab this thematic arc with genre bolstering aplomb.\r\n\r\nBacking up Bogart is the top billed Ida Lupinio (as we would come to expect she's strong and perfect foil to her lead man), while the likes of Alan Curtis, Arthur Kennedy, Henry Hull, Cornel Wilde, Henry Travers and Joan Leslie (badly overacting but amazingly not hurting the production) help to put High Sierra firmly in the drawer that holds classic crime pictures from a golden age. Not just content to be a close look at deep and elegiac characters, High Sierra does not lack in the action department either, in fact Walsh does an incredible job of knitting together heart and gusto for dramatic entertainment purpose. \r\n\r\nCome the finale at Mount Whitney (High Sierra a constant looming presence in the film, a key character}, the thrills have more than catered for the inclined seekers of that particular bent, but ultimately as the credits role, Walsh's camera leaves us in no doubt as to what has driven Roy, and High Sierra, to its point of meaning, leaving us with a special and great movie indeed. 9/10"

Samuel Bronston pulls together quite a cast as Hollywood (via Madrid and Valencia) gives us it's version of the failed/foiled Boxer rebellion that lead to the ultimate decline of the Dragon Throne. Charlton Heston and David Niven develop a decent enough chemistry as the story takes shape, and Ava Gardner, Flora Robson, Leo Genn and Paul Lukas ensure there is some strength and depth to the supporting cast, and therefore to the story of the siege of the diplomatic compound in Peking by Chinese rebels in 1900. The sets are testament to what could be done in a world before CGI (and I bet the budgets wouldn't be that much different, either) and the mass-participation scenes are colourful, noisy and look good. As ever with these kind of films, there is an inevitability around the outcome; however preposterous the odds - but this is still a commendable effort to enlighten us, a little, as to the attitude of the colonial powers to China at the turn of the 20th Century."

On a weekend getaway, they venture to a condo outside of town to practice & party with a few invited guys. Unfortunately Courtney is haunted by the past, suffering post-traumatic neurosis marked by a rockabilly driller killer in her nightmares.\r\n\r\n“Slumber Party Massacre II” (1987) improves upon the unimaginative bluntness of the first film (1982) with a superior cast of females, highlighted by winsome Bernard and blonde Heidi Kozak as Sally. Juliette Cummins is also on hand as redhead Sheila, who previously appeared in “Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning” (1985) and “Psycho III” (1986).\r\n\r\nThe film clicks with kinetic mojo and is almost ingenious in the way it dares to sneer at horror conventions for the first two-thirds. Instead, it focuses on establishing the quality characters, the fun antics of their outing and Courtney’s bloody nightmares, the latter of which borrows from “A Nightmare on Elm Street” (1984). \r\n\r\nLike “Friday the 13th Part V,” the movie emphasizes the lingering negative aftereffects of an episode with a mad killer. The driller killer from Courtney’s nightmares is curiously part rockabilly greaser and part mid-80’s metal maniac; naturally a little reminiscent of the rock star killer from “Trick or Treat” (1986), Sammi Curr, but less dead serious and more comical.\r\n\r\nI suppose some of the editing in the suspenseful last act could be chalked up to amateurish filmmaking (e.g. when the girl falls from the ledge), but perhaps it better reflects what’s really happening. I’d say more but I don’t want to give away spoilers. Let’s just say 2 + 2 = 4.

The movie has a hip flair and is filled with newer country music (for 1993, that is). Aside from trying to make it in the music business the story naturally revolves around Kyle and James' attraction to Miranda and their ensuing rivalry.\r\n\r\nThe film never cops a meanspirited vibe, despite one brawl. The viewer gets the impression that these are good, talented people who will remain friends no matter what.\r\n\r\nA couple of things make the film worthwhile, for me anyway. One is the magnetic performance of River Phoenix, who was 22 during filming. His face looks like Quorthon of Bathory (when he was in his 20s), if you're familiar with that obscure metal band.\r\n\r\nHe exudes the brooding charisma of Marlon Brando, just different. Unfortunately, three and a half months after the movie's release River was found dead outside an L.A. nightclub due to an overdose. He was only 23. Samantha Mathis (Miranda) was dating him at the time. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of whom, Samantha is the second key highlight of this flick wherein she even outshines Sandra Bullock. Keep in mind that this was the year _before_ Bullock's breakout with \"Speed.\" Samantha's beauty is captured well in a couple scenes, like around the 40-minute mark when Linda Lue's beau is passed out on the bed. It's too bad Samantha never broke-out, like Sandra. Her most popular flick is arguably \"Broken Arrow\" (1996) and then she pretty much disappeared from feature films.\r\n\r\nA few country stars have cameos, like Trisha Yearwood and Pam Tillis.\r\n\r\n\"The Thing Called Love\" may not be a great country music film like \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" (1980) but it's pretty solid and highlighted by the brooding charisma of River Phoenix. He was great and it's a pity he died so prematurely.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 56 minutes, with the the Director's Cut running a couple minutes longer. It and was mostly shot in Nashville, with one scene done at Graceland in Memphis and another one in Santa Clarita, California (the bus stop / cafe sequence where Miranda writes a song).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/B"

Page does fine as long as he’s working with real actors as opposed to the band members.\r\n\r\nSorcery’s music is a meshing of 70’s bands like Alice Cooper, Sweet, Zeppelin, Styx and Boston, just hampered by vestiges of Woodstock, if you know what I mean. They later did the soundtrack for the heavy metal slasher “Rocktober Blood” (1984) in which they adapted their style to the early 80’s metal scene, improving their sound with songs like “I’m Back” and “Killer on the Loose” (check ’em out on Youtube).   \r\n\r\nMonique van de Ven from the Netherlands joins statuesque Margaret on the female front as an actress on the show Grant is working on.\r\n\r\nAs a documentary on 70’s stunt work, this is entertaining enough, but I had enough of Sorcery’s music & performances by about the 55-minute mark.

Music is by Leigh Harline and cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca. \r\n\r\nBrad Collins (Ryan) was a one time member of the communist party.

Casting aside that it's all a bit daft these days, with its red hysteria leanings (though it serves as a most interesting social document of the era), there's a number of tight scenes and enough moody atmospherics to keep this out of basement hell. \r\n\r\nCharacterisations are rich in noir traditions, a protag whose past is back to bite him, a slinky femme fatale, a dutiful wife in the dark, and villains of substance. Be it Gomez's weasel Commie boss stomping around like a malevolent tyrant or Talman's fairground working hit-man for hire, the latter with a dress code as mirthful as it is strangely unnerving, the baddies offer up some sort of balance in a screenplay that's not sure where it ideally stands. The violence hits hard, with shocking deaths, and in good dark noir style the finale holds court for the right reasons. \r\n\r\nAdd in a cast who don't let anyone down and the great Musuraca showing his photographic skills (though not as much as we would like), then it's a more than decent viewing experience.

        "content": "Warren Oates walks like bank robber John Dillinger, he talks like Dillinger, he shoots like Dillinger, and he is one of the best things about \"Dillinger.\" John Milius wrote and directed this 1973 action packed biopic about the infamous bank robber. It acknowledges Arthur Penn's \"Bonnie and Clyde\" a couple of times, but Milius' script is not as good as the eye-wow he shows us. The story may be familiar, it has been told on dozens of true crime documentaries. John Dillinger and his gang terrorized the Midwest with violent bank robberies. He was captured in Arizona, brought back to Indiana, and escaped from jail using a bar of soap carved into the shape of a gun and blackened with shoe polish. Hot on his trail was the FBI's Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), who made it his own personal vendetta to kill all of these criminals, smoking cigars over their dead bodies. The gang have their own loving bad girls to hunker down with, and Dillinger had prostitute Billie (Michelle Phillips). Dillinger was killed outside the Biograph Theater in Chicago while seen with the infamous lady in red, Anna Sage (Cloris Leachman).\r\n\r\nWhile \"Bonnie and Clyde\" was a historic entry in the crime film genre, I thought the film makers in that situation glorified the duo a little too often. \"Dillinger\" does the opposite, making the bank robber as mean as we imagine he was. Milius' efforts to portray Dillinger as a villain backfire, since we see him in the couple of years before his death, never finding out how he got in to crime in the first place. His family is briefly shown, but nothing comes from the scene. Milius throws us into Dillinger's exploits immediately, but without any background, there is not sympathy, empathy, and eventually interest involved with the man. The beginning of the film is an exercise in choppy editing and stiff scenes until we get to the actions sequences. It makes me wonder what was left on the cutting room floor.\r\n\r\nBen Johnson plays a great Melvin Purvis, a wonderful character name if I didn't know the person existed in real life. While he should be our hero, Purvis is shown to be just as violent as Dillinger. Milius plays with us, with Purvis showing no mercy for some criminals, yet sparing others, without any kind of explanation. We know Purvis as well as we know Dillinger.  What does Milius leave us with? Incredible shootout sequences. There is a giant gun battle at a house that takes forever and is worth every minute of film. The film is violent and does not flinch when it comes to showing the death and destruction done by both sides of the law. Milius' direction is good, and his fuzzy Depression era vistas are pretty to look at. The cinematography is great, as is the set design and costuming. The rest of the supporting cast is fine, and full of some recognizable names. Michelle Phillips is okay as Billie, although this moll type part is old hat. Harry Dean Stanton is funny as gang member Homer, his final scene is one of the best in the film. Cloris Leachman, then a recent Oscar winner, has just two scenes as Anna, I would have liked to see more. Oates is the best Dillinger ever portrayed on film. Tons of character actors populate the rest of the cast: Geoffrey Lewis, John P. Ryan, Steve Kanaly, Frank McRae, Richard Dreyfuss as Baby Face Nelson, all good. With \"Dillinger,\" you get a mixed bag. On the one hand, you have incredibly violent shootouts that took many lives. On the other hand, you have no reason to care about these characters or their internal motivations. Maybe we know how Purvis felt about Dillinger after all."

After meeting her in person and realising that she only has eyes for her husband, the renowned pianist Stephen Orlac, he buys a life size mannequin of her and dreams of doing what Pygmalion did with Galatea. When Stephen is involved in an horrific train crash and has both his hands crushed beyond healing, Yvonne pleads with Gogol to help save his well being, he does, by amputating the crushed hands and grafting on the hands of a recently executed murderer, a murderer whose speciality was knives!\r\n\r\nMad Love is one of those amazingly old classics that is a hybrid of genre staples. At times it's surrealist and at others it's operating via a Grand Guginol pulse, whilst knowingly it laces the story with an uneasy comedic bent. Boasting camera work from Gregg Toland and Chester Lyons and directed by the impressive Karl Freund, this adaptation of Maurice Renard's novel is a chillingly memorable piece of work. Working off a plot that sees the bad Doctor driven by lustations rather than out and out insanity, Freund revels in slowly winding the coil until the spring that is Peter Lorre (Gogol) explodes (implodes), cloaking various scenes in telling shadows that themselves become integral to the plot. Peter Lorre is of course in his element, demented yet sympathetic, it's real hard to take your eyes away from his magnetic weirdness. Colin Clive as Stephen Orlac also puts in a performance of note, all twitchy nervousness and believable emotional torment, whilst Frances Drake more than adequately brings vulnerability to the centrifugal importance of Yvonne's emotional turmoil.\r\n\r\nWeird and gorgeous, and incredibly well written, Mad Love holds up very well today as a horror/romance film of vast influential worth. So see it in the dark and marvel at its various moments of cinematic excellence. 8.5/10"

When the latter escapes all hell breaks loose. \r\n\r\nMade in 1983 but not released until 1987, \"Blood Rage\" was originally called “Slasher” (as the title card reads) and recut as “Nightmare at Shadow Woods,” which abbreviated much of the gore and nudity to avoid an ‘X’ rating in other regions. Speaking of which, there is quite a bit of well-done gore in the full version, if that’s your thang. The nudity is pretty much par for the course with maybe a bit more than usual.\r\n\r\nLisa Randall stands out in the feminine department as curvy Andrea. Unfortunately, this was her only acting role. Meanwhile Julie Gordon (Karen) is the proverbial final girl. On the other side of the gender spectrum, Mark Soper is great as the twin brothers; he’s really able to distinguish the two (and I was seriously wondering if they were played by two different actors).\r\n\r\nThe first 55 minutes are quite good for a 2nd tier slasher (think “Sleepaway Camp”) with its quaint early 80’s electronic score. But the last act fumbles the ball and becomes increasingly tedious. A certain person shouldn’t have been removed from the proceedings.    \r\n   \r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 22 minutes, and was shot in Jacksonville, particularly the University of North Florida, whereas the drive-in theater interiors were done in New Jersey.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

Needless to say, poor old \"Gino\" knew nothing of her past, nor of her incarceration so when they meet some time later things are, shall we say, awkward! This is a gorgeous film to enjoy, the story offers us hope and despair, joy and frustration as their love tries to survive just about all that can be thrown at it.

From the very beginning, it should be clear to anyone that a movie with Paul Naschy and under the English title of \"The Werewolf vs. The Vampire Women\" is not going to be precisely the kind of horror movie anyone would take seriously. Not because Mr. Naschy cannot be taken seriously. As a matter of fact, I acknowledge him as a Latin horror legend and he has been in some of the finest horror films in Spanish I have seen, such as \"Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll\", for instance. On the other hand, this multifaceted actor, is also well-known for being in some of the most bizarre and random horror movies throughout the 60s and 70s. With this cute little horror flick, I mistakenly anticipated myself to a little bit of tasteless amusement that in the long run, was going to earn my reverences. If there wasn't any good gore, then at least I would have expected unintentionally humorous results, but sadly, this film fails to deliver the expected elements of entertainment that a horror fan would imagine in a film of this kind.\r\n\r\nIn \"La Noche de Warpugis\", Elvira and Genevive, go to the French countryside, with the intention of making some enquiries about a wicked Countess named Wandessa, who lived through the 13th century and who was recognized for devoting herself to Satan, among other things. When the journey is about to come to an end, Elvira's car runs out of gas and the girls finds themselves lost in the middle of the French nowhere with no one else in the area to give them a hand. Luckily, Elvira and Genevive find relief when a mysterious man named Waldemar appears out of the blue, to offer them a place to stay before the night falls. However, Mr. Valdemar is actually a really enchanting little werewolf who lives with his crazy sister hidden inside the house and while he intends to be a normal person with good manners, his ferocious nature forces him to be wild and dangerous to be friends with. As if this wasn't already enough, Countess Wandessa who has been sleeping for centuries, suddenly revives and goes back to her old tricks again, without expecting an equally strong rival like Waldemar, who won't let her get away with the same wicked behavior she once had. In \"The Night of the Walpurgis\", the werewolf and the vampire women find themselves battling in a dull and banal encounter, in which the viewers are the only ones who actually lose.\r\n\r\nToo bad this film was so below my expectations. Like I said before, I expected at least some decent childishness to amuse myself. There's basically no gore whatsoever and the few death scenes, are rather effortless and insipid. Several films with Paul Naschy are well-known for having a little bit of everything, so I supposse I should give a friendly warning to anyone who thinks \"La Noche de Walpurgis\" is also going to be like this. Honestly, I got so bored watching this film, that in the end, the only reason why I didn't leave it incomplete, it's because I wanted to see if something would save it during the last minutes. Unfortunately, the silly opening sequence is about as good as it gets all the way trough."

Take it from me and my personal relationship experiences, Italians really know how to express themselves. The sex is always outstanding, but you always have to go through and endure your share of blood, sweat and tears (as The Smithereens once famously sang, 'I get the blues before and after loving you.')\r\n\r\nIn terms of great horror protagonists, Paul Naschy has always been both the saving grace and missing link, the great Spanish hope. Lord Almighty, he always seemed a direct cross between a 60's Marlon Brando (when he was starting to get disillusioned and pudgy because no one could come up with ideas or roles worthy of his monumental talents) and John Belushi. He always possessed this tortured mythos, channeling the very best of Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr. Yes, he was a monster, but he couldn't help himself, and his nasty habits went against the very fiber of his being. No matter how bad the material (which he usually wrote, under an alias), he was always fervently watchable.\r\n\r\nTangentially, Jean-Luc Godard once said that Roger Vadim was 'with it'. The literal translation: He makes bad films, but he knows what people wants to see. 'The Fury of the Wolfman' is like that. Director Zabalza knows his audience inside and out. EVERY SINGLE female character, without exception, is drop-dead gorgeous, not to mention scantily clad at every possible moment. There are whips, chains, bondage--every type of scenario a full-blooded person, even remotely intrigued in sexuality, would be head-over-heels over. The plot is meaningless and deserves to be. It's never the point. All the filmmakers are looking for is 90 minutes of cinematic fun and excitement that people will want to peruse, and you get that here, and are left completely satisfied. As The Kinks famously said, 'Give the People What They Want!'"

Arriving at the Medina castle, he finds the Medina family deeply suspicious characters and the castle itself a foreboding place harnessing a deadly past.\r\n\r\nThe Pit And The Pendulum is the second film in the series of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations that director Roger Corman tackled, it's also easily one of the best. Part horror, part dreamy thriller, and of course with little dashes of humour within, it all comes together rather well. We open with a beach approach to the Medina castle, a big monolithic structure hulking on a cliff edge - naturally accompanied by a misty shroud - we know from this moment on that unease is about to become our middle name. Once inside the castle it's evident that it is a major player in our story, roaring fireplaces and secret chambers all excellently framed by Corman and his team. A story of madness, deceit and sadistic ancestry then plays out to the full to make The Pit And The Pendulum one of the Poe adaptations leading lights.\r\n\r\nEnlisting the brilliant Richard Matheson to flesh out and extend the Poe short story, he's the perfect man to bring about a Gothic classic. Corman again uses Vincent Price as his leading man and he's rewarded with a quite delicious performance from the big man, where camp and burgeoning madness go hand in hand like they were always meant to be a team. The rest of the cast are naturally trailing in the shadow of Price's greatness, but a noteworthy mention must also go to the good work from Barbara Steele as Elizabeth. Floyd Crosby is again on board for cinematography duties, beautifully realising the lush colour and the doom laden feel of the Medina castle. Then there's Corman himself, who puts in some of his best work here, his use of the camera really adding to the burgeoning sense of dread that flows throughout the piece - the high point a stunning POV victim sequence of the pendulum of the title that is just one of the many technical highlights on show. 8/10"

Vincent Price plays the lord of the manor, Luana Anders his sister and Antony Carbone his doctor.\r\n\r\n\"The Pit and the Pendulum\" (1961) was the second in Roger Corman’s “Poe cycle” of eight movies from 1960-1964, plus other Poe-like flicks, like “The Terror” (1963).\r\n\r\nLike practically all of the Poe adoptions of the 60s, including those done by other directors, e.g. the “The Oblong Box” (1969), this film was simply inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and is far from a faithful adaption. Yet it was the most successful at the box office and Richard Matheson did a great job of fleshing out an entertaining story, especially considering the one-dimensional proceedings. What I mean is that the entire story takes place in the forbidding castle, except for a couple coastal shots. \r\n\r\nFrom the 70s to the present horror flicks have resorted to increasing gore to shock audiences while filmmakers in the 60s had to focus more on spooky atmosphere, melodrama and creepy innuendo mixed with ghastly shocks, albeit relatively bloodless. This is a colorful eerie flick for the Fall season (or any season) if you’re in the mood for dark castles, haunted hallways, horrific chambers, cobwebs, Medieval décor, gallantry, sinful secrets and the threat of ghastly death. \r\n\r\nBoth Luana Anders and Barbara Steele were only 22 during shooting and attractive.\r\n\r\nAIP was basically the American version of Hammer in England, so devotees of Hammer horror should eat this up.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 20 minutes, and was shot at Raleigh Studios, Hollywood, with the coastal shots done at Palos Verdes, which is about 20 miles south on the seaside.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+/A-"

It influenced future movies; for instance, the blood from the ceiling was later done in “The Devil’s Nightmare” (1971), aka “The Devil Walks at Midnight.” Meanwhile the music box angle was used in “For a Few Dollars More” (1965).\r\n\r\nWhile this is an Italian movie, the cast is international with Steele being English, Baldwin & Medin American and Jotta Italian. Barbara is youthful and bright-eyed at the age of 24 during shooting.\r\n\r\nWhile the story is simple, the eerie ambiance is to die for. “The Ghost” is worth checking out for anyone interested in ghostly Gothic horror taking place in spooky Euro-styled castles or manors, such as “The Innocents” (1960), \"The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll\" (1960) and “The Tomb of Ligeia” (1964).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Rome.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

It stars Martin Sheen, Charlie Sheen and Laurence Fishburne. Music is by Georges Delerue and cinematography by Richard Leiterman.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of his father, Pfc. Franklin Bean (C Sheen) gets drunk and assaults an MP. Sentenced to 90 days in an army stockade run by bigoted bully MSgt. Otis V. McKinney (M Sheen), Bean finds he is the only white prisoner in the facility...\r\n\r\nBetter than it has any right to be visually, and rising above what looked to be scratchy themes on the page, Cadence rounds out as a more than enjoyable character study. After a poor opening suggests the picture is going to be an hour and half of Charlie Sheen over doing the brat packer persona, picture then settles into its stride once Sheen Junior encounters the aggressive Sheen Senior and is thrown in clink with the Laurence (here credited is Larry) Fishburne led \"Soul Patrol Brothers\". True enough to say that basic formula sets in as Sheen Junior can't fit in with his new \"roomies\", whilst he stays firmly in his broody bubble much to the ever increasing consternation of the agitated McKinney. No way is Bean going to let McKinney break him, even as the gruff voiced warden starts to come down hard on his newly adopted brothers, this merely serves as the catalyst for some black and white unity, which if given a chance can always be powerful.\r\n\r\nAt the centre of the character hot pot is a broken water windmill that serves as a beacon of hope for the prisoners, but sure enough we know where this is going and it will form the basis of the last quarter of the story as things invariably go bad before a ray of hope springs from the narrative. It's all very predictable and obvious, but Shryack's screenplay allows the characters depth, with much detailed emotion afforded the lead protagonists. Bonus, too, is that the secondary roles don't just serve as props, they impact hard on proceedings, something all too rare in prison/institution set movies. Smart sound-tracking as well, with Harry Stewart (Sweetbread Crane) singing his own beautiful composition \"End of My Journey\", a song that lands in your chest and stays there for quite some time.\r\n\r\nSheen Junior has rarely been better away from Oliver Stone's guidance, no doubt spurred on by his father's presence in front of and behind the camera. However, Sheen Senior's direction is only safe and basic, while his acting is the films only real weak acting link. You have to feel that with his subsequent non directing career, Martin Sheen found it wasn't for him, certainly blending both acting and directing appears to have been a step too far for the otherwise very talented actor. Fishburne is quality, while F. Murray Abraham shines in one of the smaller roles.\r\n\r\nA drama with touches of comedy, and full of good honest intentions to offer hope and inspiration, Cadence is a very good movie. That comes on proviso, though, if one can accept it on its formulaic terms. 7/10"

        "content": "Many superstitions are based on fact. \r\n\r\nWarning: Spoilers\r\n \r\nJohn Brahm's film is an adaptation of the novel written by Jessie Douglas Kerruish. Following the success for Universal with The Wolf Man a year earlier, 20th Century Fox clearly saw an opportunity to cash in on the renewed interest in Lycanthropic creatures. Brahm's film deals with one such legendary creature that is said to terrorise members of the cursed Hammond family. Roping in master photographer Lucien Ballard, Brahm sets the film up with the creepy ancestral home atop of a cliff, the sea on one side, the foggy moor on the other. Then with minimal budget and a cast of largely minor players-and a short 23 day production schedule, Brahm crafted a tight, eerie mystery that deserves far better appraisal than it's currently getting.\r\n\r\nAtmosphere is of paramount importance when making a Gothic type picture, The Undying Monster has it by the bucket load. Aided by Ballard's adroit skills, Brahm excellently uses shadows and light to garner unease, be it the interiors that are gorgeously designed, or the foggy exteriors perhaps hiding dark secrets, atmosphere is high quality here. The film has been chided in certain quarters for either being too talky, or for daring to be jovial at times. Yes these charges are fair if one is expecting an outright horror film and not the creepy mystery that it actually is. This is no boo jump bonanza, the creature is purposely kept from us so as to keep us, and the characters wondering when, or if, it will show up. Thus the conversations become crucial and of high interest. Something that hasn't helped the film either is its title, why they didn't go with the first muted {and English title} name, \"The Hammond Mystery\" is probably due to the afore mentioned attempt to cash in on The Wolf Man. As you can see, one screams out that the film is about a monster who can't be killed, the other sounds like it's an Agatha Christie who done it?. You understand their reasonings, it's just very misleading and hasn't helped the films reputation to flow.\r\n\r\nIt's a cracking mystery film that has horror elements involved in its plot. More like The Hound Of The Baskervilles than The Wolf Man, it none the less is 63 minutes of 1940s Gothic joy. 8/10"

It’s one of those lesser grade film noir movies from the classic cycle that should have been super, but isn’t. It’s also a Sterling Hayden film that gives his knockers ammunition to call him wooden, yet the tedious direction of Hooper and all round over staging of the production is what’s at fault here.\r\n\r\nPlot has Barry (over acting) as a suspected cop killer who walks free to apparently wreak more misery on the police force. Hayden’s stoic and robust detective is not having a bit of it and becomes obsessed with bringing Barry’s edgy character to justice. Grahame slinks into view in shapely fashion after half hour of film, to naturally stir the hornet’s nest still further.\r\n\r\nThe potential is there for a hot-to-trot noir of psychological substance, a peek under the skin of men teetering on the thin line separating good and bad. Sadly it’s all so laborious and fake, the male actors indulging in what I call auto-cue acting as they act out badly staged scenes. Grahame comes out of it relatively unscathed, while Metty gives the production an atmosphere it doesn’t deserve with some slats and shads dalliances.

When, next evening, a police officer is murdered Detective Chief Sterling Hayden (\"Conway\") becomes obsessed with bringing Barry to justice - an obsession that costs him his job and leads him to a confrontation with his foe in a rundown village on the Mexican border. The plot is all pretty much ABC, Hayden is pretty dry and and, to be honest, Graham isn't so hot either as \"Marianna\" but she does have something about her that holds the attention (certainly not her rather curious dance/shimmy routine which is pretty silly). The dialogue is a bit weedy, and maybe if it had lost 20 minutes or so it might have tightened up the rather rambling story a bit but as it is, it's really nothing special."

One of the more enjoyable elements here is the fact that this one really goes quite nicely with the traditional style of efforts featuring that old-school film style. Playing on the archetype of the old-dark-house mysteries with the idea of relatives gathered together to read the will of a recently-deceased relative only to find themselves involved in a greater horror while staying there, that one gives this a great ploy for having suspenseful moments due to this type of storyline. From the large grand layout and Gothic design of the house, there’s plenty to like here while this one plays out the rather fun notion of what’s going on as the film’s main focus here on taking on measures to find the cat and silence it which plays out throughout the film. These are quite fun from trapping it within cages and trapping it to chasing it around the house and other means of disposing of it which makes for a rather striking and somewhat fun efforts, while there’s some rather good stuff to be had here with the later revenge tactics to showcase the cat going around the house with them being paranoid about it to the point of rather comical natures of what’s going on here. That in itself is the biggest problem with the film, in that it’s central premise is so ludicrous and laughably played-out here that it really strains itself way too often to the point of the cast themselves pointing out how insane the film’s plot actually is. That’s never a good sign, and it’s helped along by the fact that this one really strains the credibility of the action here with the relatives going for the cat in such contrived and increasingly bizarre ways that it feels somewhat silly to have them play out as they do. The last flaw here is the fact that this one really doesn’t have all that great of a pace here which really stumbles with all the time spent on doing some rather than dealing with the cat as the family squabbles over the money or the group conniving about finding ways to stop the cat which are so stuffy and bland that it doesn’t feature much of any interest during these parts. It’s enough to really make it stumble along during the mid-section when it’s not involved in anything, and these here do hold it down rather significantly.\r\n\r\nToday’s Rating/PG: Violence and tense themes of animal abuse."

The asides to the Nazi occupation of France at the time not being acknowledged until some years later. That very theme obviously holds considerable weight, but it's not the be all and end all of Clouzot's magnificent movie.\r\n\r\nClouzot and Chavance tap into the troubling fallibility of the human race, portraying a town quickly submerged in moral decay. There is caustic observations on the higher echelons of society, a clinical deconstruction of a town quick to cast aspersions without thinking of consequences, while the script boasts frank intelligence and no fear of censorship. That a town so ripe in respected denizens could become so diseased, so quickly, makes for powerful viewing.

Shadows feature prominently, even in daylight, canted angles are used to great effect, broken mirrors perfectly imbuing the fractures of the human psyche. A number of scenes are startlingly memorable, a funeral procession and a church service interrupted by one of The Raven's letters are superbly staged, the pursuit of a nurse through the cobbled streets is menacing, and the finale is hauntingly raw. Top performances across the board from the cast brings further rewards, whilst simultaneously adding more plaudits to Clouzot's direction.

The letters are signed by someone calling themselves Le Corbeau (The Raven), and pretty soon the town starts to implode as suspicion and mistrust runs wild. \r\n\r\nFamously it was the film that saw Clouzot banned from making films, the then young director receiving flak from all quarters of the Vichy Government - Catholic Church - Left Wingers and others too! The asides to the Nazi occupation of France at the time not being acknowledged until some years later. That very theme obviously holds considerable weight, but it's not the be all and end all of Clouzot's magnificent movie. \r\n\r\nClouzot and Chavance tap into the troubling fallibility of the human race, portraying a town quickly submerged in moral decay. There is caustic observations on the higher echelons of society, a clinical deconstruction of a town quick to cast aspersions without thinking of consequences, while the script boasts frank intelligence and no fear of censorship. That a town so ripe in respected denizens could become so diseased, so quickly, makes for powerful viewing. All are guilty as well, nobody escapes, even the youngsters are liars or cheats, thieves or rumour spreaders, this be a Hades town where negativity runs rife and leads to broken bodies, broken souls and broken human spirits. \r\n\r\nVery much a bastion of proto-noir cinema, it's photographed with an awareness to marry up to the acerbic thematic at work. Shadows feature prominently, even in daylight, canted angles are used to great effect, broken mirrors perfectly imbuing the fractures of the human psyche. A number of scenes are startlingly memorable, a funeral procession and a church service interrupted by one of The Raven's letters are superbly staged, the pursuit of a nurse through the cobbled streets is menacing, and the finale is hauntingly raw. Top performances across the board from the cast brings further rewards, whilst simultaneously adding more plaudits to Clouzot's direction. All in all, a remarkable, fascinating and potent piece of cinema. 9/10"

        "content": "Sentimental and affecting piece from Ford.\r\n\r\nHaving already made a version of the story in 1919 as Marked Men with Harry Carey, John Ford clearly had a kink for this delightful redemption parable. Opening with a touching tribute to his friend and mentor Carey, who had sadly passed away the previous year (and who also starred in the 1916 version of The Three Godfathers), it was also the first out and out Ford Western to be made in colour.\r\n\r\nThe story tells of three outlaws - Robert Hightower (John Wayne), Pedro \"Pete\" Fuerte (Pedro Armendariz) and The Abilene Kid (Harry Carey Junior) - who after robbing a bank in the town of Welcome, are on the run from the law led posse. After hitting problems in a desert sandstorm, the men struggle on to Terrapin Tanks, where they happen across a woman in labour. Giving birth to her child, but sadly on her death bed, the woman begs the men to take care of her baby. They agree and embark on a perilous journey to get the child safely to \"New Jerusalem\"...\r\n\r\nIt's an odd sort of Western, but in a good way. Backed up by the usual high standard of location work from Ford and the irrepressible Winton Hoch. And with customary staunch support work from Ward Bond as the Sheriff, 3 Godfathers is a must see in relation to the careers of John Ford and John Wayne. It has a mixed reputation from fans of the two Johns, which is understandable given the flighty nature of the picture, but one thing that is true about the piece is that once viewed, it's unlikely to be forgotten. 7/10"

        "content": "It's interesting that Harry Carey was in the first version of this film made in 1916 and now his son takes on the role as the injured \"kid\" alongside John Wayne's \"Robert\" and Pedro Armendàriz as \"Pedro\". These three are outlaws whose one last hit goes a bit awry. Now with the shrewd sheriff \"Buck\" (Ward Bond) in hot pursuit, they must try to outwit their pursuers before they run out of water. They do manage to steal a bit of a march and make it to a well, but the only water they discover is coming from the eyes of a heavily pregnant woman (Mildred Natwick) who promptly delivers them a godson. Still no better off, and with an added mouth to satiate, the three must now continue to evade capture and struggle on through the desert. It takes quite a while to get going, this, but once we have the established character dynamic then the story is actually quite a poignant story of loyalty and determination, decency and teamwork. Tragedy strikes on more then one occasion and yes, of course, it's very rarely a real baby being bounced around the terrain, but somehow the actors, Armendáriz in particular, manage to illicit quite a fair degree of sympathy as they trek through the dry and hostile wilderness. The last ten minutes didn't quite work for me, but then I don't suppose John Ford could actually have... The photography is grand and grim - that these men could survive the perils of the landscape at all is a feat all too well illustrated by the bleakness of their surroundings and there is an overall spirit of redemption at the conclusion that does raise a smile. Certainly one of the Duke's more considered efforts and well worth a watch."

        "content": "The 1947 Escape Attempt At La Sante Prison.\r\n\r\nLe Trou (The Hole) is directed by Jacques Becker and adapted to screenplay by Becker, Jose Giovani and Jean Aurel from Giovani’s own novel. It stars Michel Constantin, Jean Keraudy, Philippe Leroy, Raymond Meunier, Marc Michel and Jean-Paul Coquelin. \r\n\r\nJacques Becker’s last film before he would pass away shortly after the film’s completion, is a tightly wound prison procedural that deals in grim realism and claustrophobic sparsity. There’s no prison movie clichés here, there’s no sadistic prison staff, no Mr. Big who is in with the wardens and demands money with menace, and no rapists hovering about the place to seize by force and break the last inch of spirit of the victim, this is as pure and unfussily raw as it gets. \r\n\r\nBased on a real escape attempt at La Sante Prison in 1947, story has four men in a cell plotting to escape via digging a hole in their cell. When construction work within the prison means a number of prisoners have to be relocated, the four men are a bit perturbed to find they have another inmate thrust into their already overcrowded cell. While of course there’s the small matter of the escape attempt that’s planned, will they be able to trust the newcomer? Will he join in and help? Pertinent questions hang heavy in the sweaty air. \r\n\r\nOnce Claude Gaspard (Michel) arrives in the cell, the narrative initially operates on a cat and mouse basis as the men sound out the newcomer. There’s no histrionics, no threats of violence, an enforcement of machismo to intimidate the new cellmate, just human interaction with viable concerns. Much of these passages pulse with atmosphere as the men talk in hushed tones, or just exchange glances, and then once an accord is reached, all parties are comfortable with each other, it’s time to put the escape plan into action. \r\n\r\nWhat follows is quite simply engrossing suspense as Becker deals in long takes of silence punctuated by animal strength as the men pound on concrete with metal. The camera stays static, filming as if in real time, the sound department ramp up the volume to splinter the ears. We observe as the men fashion devices to aid their escape and to remain undetected, some of it genius in its simplicity. And all the while there is the feeling of trust, a bond between the incarcerated males, where the two lead off men are entrusted to go out and beyond the bowels of the prison, working tirelessly in charting the course through a maze of murky masonry, and to then return back to “HQ” for some rest and updates of the progress… \r\n\r\nThe use of non professional actors works brilliantly, adding further realism to the story, with one of them, Jean Keraudy, a bona fide prisoner from the actual event back in 1947. There’s no music here, it isn’t needed to emphasise or manipulate a scene, none more so with the denouement, a closure of some emotional magnitude, and once again it’s without histrionics, and once again it works brilliantly. 9/10"

        "content": "This week's Noir of the Week is Le Trou (1960) directed by Jacques Becker. The film was called The Night Watch when released in the US in 1960.\r\n\r\nThe 2 ½ hour prison escape film, like Rififi, utilizes long, unbroken, often dialogue-free shots to dramatize the simple story of a group of prisoners attempting an ambitious escape from prison. Le Trou is shot in black and white and is totally without soundtrack music until the very end.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with one of the escapees, now outside the Santé Prison walls introducing the story. The film then flashes back to the Paris prison in 1947.\r\n\r\nWe’re then introduced to a young man Claude Gaspard. He’s put into a very small cell with four other inmates. There he meets the charming, always smiling Volsselin, nicknamed Monseigneur. Also in the cell are fellow inmates Roland Darbant, the man who introduced the film, Geo Cassid, and Manu Borelli.\r\n\r\nThe men work in their cell assembling cardboard boxes. Gaspard finds out that the men in his cell all eat well from care packages from the outside and all are close friends. What he doesn’t realize is that the men are working on escaping. While picking up a care package filled with bread, butter, saugage, smoked fish and rice pudding, the men discuss whether the should tell the new guy about their prison escape plans. They eventually take Gaspard into their confidence and being the long task of breaking the floor.\r\n\r\nSlowly, in real time, the men chip away at the concrete floor that leads to a sewer tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe film lacks most prison film clichés. There are no sadistic prison guards, and all the prisoners seem like regular guys. Director Becker, who died shortly after the film was completed, used unprofessional actors including Jean Keraudy who was an actual participant in the escape attempt in 1947.\r\n\r\nGiven the film takes place in only three days, the sense of overwhelming tenacity shown by the prisoners is an astounding piece of filmmaking. The film has a number of memorable scenes, including the noisy breaking of the concrete floor with one of the bed legs –in real time- while another prisoner looks out the peep hole using a spy glass made from a tooth brush and a broken piece of mirror. Watching the scene draws you in an even makes you feel like a participant in the hacking, sawing and picking.\r\n\r\nI won’t give away the ending or any of the interesting plot twists, but let’s just say there’s a heart-breaking double cross involved in a very un-Hollywood finish. Young Gaspard has to bear the brunt of an ironic plot-twist at the end. The film is a great prison escape film not to be mistaken for the French New Wave happening at the same time.\r\n\r\nWritten by Steve-O"

The former wins a fortune on the lottery and must travel to Paris to collect her winnings. Her fiancé Ronnie (Bruce Seton) is a typical working class fellow who struggles to reconcile with her having more cash than he can ever hope to make, and simultaneously she meets the suave, debonair Rathbone who is looking to rent her flat. Next thing, \"Ronnie\" has been dumped and she and \"Gerald\" are on the grand tour of Europe with her substantial fortune. Essentially a two-hander, the relationship stinks from the start - you just know that he is up to something (it's an Agatha Christie story, after all) - and soon we learn just what, and that she is now in quite some peril. It's a well adapted and paced thriller with strong characters that keep this off the rocks of melodrama well. Rarely seen these days, but by all means give it a go."

Shortly after cleaning up on the inheritance, he moves with his friend \"Maurice\" (Martin Kosleck) to start afresh. Now you don't have to be Einstein to recognise that these two men are more than just roomies, and that causes a bit of consternation when \"Dr. Sebastian\" finds new prey. This time, in the guise of the deeply troubled \"Linda\" (Ellen Drew). With a marriage and a trip to Quito on the cards, might history be about to repeat itself? Well, fortunately for \"Linda\" reporter \"Sawyer\" (John Howard) is also a bit suspicious of the man, and after a bit of investigation and a chat with \"Downer\", the two begin to piece together quite a different persona for Rathbone than the one he has been successful peddling thus far. Can they act in time to thwart his malevolent plan? Tim Whelan allows his star to exude menace here. The script is really only adequate, but the pace is good and the gradually accumulating sense of peril - and a wonderfully seedy contribution from the increasingly envious \"Maurice\" leads us towards a conclusion where nothing is predictable. Actually, on that front I was a little disappointed, but all in all, this is a dark and effective tale of manipulation that is well worth a watch."

Upon learning of the formula, and disguising himself as an old woman, Lavond plans to wreak horrific revenge on those who framed him and sent him to prison.\r\n\r\nIt's not very often that I actually wish myself to be older than I am, but this is one such case, I can't believe I wouldn't have been terrified back in 1936 as Todd Browning's little people went out bidding Lionel Barrymore's vengeful work! Now of course the picture looks wearily hokey, but as hokey films go, this is up with the best of them. \r\n\r\nThe special effects stand up to repeat viewings even in this day and age of overkilled S/E purely for ticket selling purposes, with the over-sized sets and props of the trade expertly realised.

Music is by Marlin Skiles and cinematography by Burnett Guffey. \r\n\r\nMike Lambert (Ford), down on his luck and fed up of getting nowhere in life, meets sultry waitress Paula Craig (Carter) and things will either get better or worse? \r\n\r\nThere's a road sign in this that grabs the attention, it reads DANGEROUS CURVES! Now that initially is in reference to a perilous road - with roads featuring prominently as dangerous parts of the play - but it quite easily could be, and in all probability is, a sneaky reference to Janis Carter's femme fatale. Paula Craig in Carter's hands dominates the film, not that Ford or Sullivan are pointless fodder, but it is both the actress and her character's show. \r\n\r\nAfter a burst of pacey excitement opens the pic, action moves on to a cafe, from where we are introduced to Guffey's talents, from this point on almost everything is atmospherically shot. Slats and shads, lamps and cell bars, all get the Guffey lens treatment that's sitting superbly with the unfolding psychological dynamics. Very early on we are delivered two characters who basically are a cheater and a viper, while the main man of our story is a guy who's struggling with his identity in life. He also likes a drink, but with that comes memory loss, which is never a good thing when you are holed up in a noirville town. \r\n\r\nStripping it back for examination you find the story is very simple, which is surprising and a little disappointing given the screenplay writer also did The Asphalt Jungle. Yet the characters and the actors performances, helped by some classy tech work, more than compensates - that is until the finale, which for some (me for sure) is a bad choice for character tone. But it's not a film killer, for we get everything from orgasmic glee shown in the process of a callous crime being committed, to characters either in need of a soul or facing their days of judgement. 7/10"

Whilst Jean Renoir has certainly produced a beautifully gritty film that evokes a genuine sense of how life on the French Chemin de fer might have been in the late 1930s', this left me feeling that a great deal had been lost between the book and the screen... \"Roubeau\" is a forty something railway conductor who has a much, much younger wife. When he discovers that she has had an affair with her godfather, he forces her to arrange a meeting on his (moving) train and kills him. Whilst not actually witnessed by fellow railway worker \"Jacques Lantier\" (another strong performance from Jean Gabin); he saw them leave the compartment and he covers for them at the subsequent enquiry - he, too has fallen for her! Though there are doubtless some enthralling scenes - particularly as he and his femme fatale; a rather insipid looking Simone Simon find their relationship become truly toxic; the story just doesn't quite catch fire for me. It's a rather melodramatic interpretation of Zola's novel - and though it is broadly faithful to the book; it lacks much of the nuance and by allowing us to see full on; rather than allow our imagination to drive our feelings about the complex relationships and demons that each of the three principal charters face, it delivers us with some stark characterisations that I didn't appreciate so much; I just didn't really empathise with them in anything like the same way as I did when I read the book. Again, Jospeh Kosma delivers a super score to accompany this; and the cinematography - especially in/around the trains is as authentic as I have seen. A good but not great film."

Responsibility for this onerous task rests firmly with \"Col.

This is all your standard contagion horror film, and is produced to a remarkably mediocre standard. The acting is pretty ropey, the script likewise and the denouement is probably the least realistic you could imagine. Taken with your tongue in your cheek, it might raise a smile or two as the stupefied locals take on more zombified (and super-human) strengths, but this is just a rehash of some more charismatically cast Hammer style films without the slightest sense of peril. It does reiterate the oft presented position that the US Military is great at starting problems but hopeless at solving them, but I'm not sure that's what George A.

The plot sees a toxic spillage make its way into a small American town's water system and turns some of the locals into marauding maniacs.\r\n\r\nEisner's movie is that rare old thing these days, that of the horror remake that greatly improves upon the original. That might annoy some Romero purists, but the truth is, is that his original film really isn't that great to begin with. Thus it's ripe for a remake, whilst acknowledging that a certain weariness creeps into our thoughts at the seemingly never ending line of horror remakes getting churned out by a Hollywood running out of ideas. Hell I will even venture that we have seen all this before, nothing in this \"Crazies\" will have the horror faithful rushing out to tell their buddies about some overtly cranial splendour piece they have just watched, but this is a very effective horror piece, taut and tense at times, at others sick and splendidly disgusting. Eisner may not be a \"Craven\", or for sure no \"Romero\", but he executes the material with gusto and shows a knack for knowing how to make the material work.\r\n\r\nThe film is structured over three parts. Character formations in the little town of the delightfully small Americana sounding Ogden Marsh, which leads into the infected going doolally. Then it's the army attempting to get things under control. Lastly it's the the fall out as our brave survivors, erm, try to survive and make sense of what is happening. Eisner and his writers even get away with not fleshing out the principal characters. We know Olyphant's Sheriff is a toughie, and that his pregnant wife, Mitchell, is equally resourceful, while the deputy played by the film's standout performer, Joe Anderson, we know is loyal and sharp with a rifle. Who cares about flesh on these bones, let the crazies after them and see how they cope. Where the writers score plus points is with the portrait of a world losing its humanity. The sick are rounded up and contained, nobody cares enough to try and help them, while those sent to restore order, to protect the people, are as dangerous as those bleeding from the eyes and ears. There's madness everywhere.\r\n\r\nWith memorable blood pumping scenes, bona fide suspense and metaphorical smarts in the writing, this is one damn fine remake shocker. 7.5/10"

And get nothing wrong, \"our\" government will contain, secure, and then protect, in that order.\r\n\r\nTimothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell kill in this, they're great start to finish.  Joe Anderson does steal the show a few times though, really embodying the spirit of a rage filled person.  Danielle Panabaker is the reason this got on my radar at all, but she is sort of \"emotional teen girl\", and I feel she's too big an actor for that, so it wasn't my favorite part.\r\n\r\nThe writing is well done, in a progressive manner that makes me think that we really missed out on a \"The Crazies\" videogame.  The thing that makes this the infection more interesting than the average rabid / zombie movie, is that these infected are still \"smart\".  Now they're uncontrollably driven to kill, but they can do it by car / rifle / coordinated attack, and even an overwhelming mob.  Hell they can even set traps.\r\n\r\nSo you're basically fighting insane people on PCP.  The infection effect seems to differ based on how inclined you are to kill people.  There were a couple that managed to hide until they came across someone they had motivation to kill before infection.  Some people are just confused, like they don't understand why they're doing what they're doing.  Others \"round up da' boys\" and go a hooting and hollering.  The range of behaviors keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\nOn top of the infected, you have the military cleansing the area who (in theory) are still in their right mind, and no idea what is the infection vector.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed this, it did remind me of \"Mom and Dad\" which has a similar infection, but the psychological motivations are much clearer and have a very nice built in complexity."

Instead, these kind farmers and mild-mannered townspeople become emotionless and murderous killers using whatever weapons they can find to expedite the slaughter. The suspense starts slow in the early minutes of the film but consistently builds to a fevered anxiety as the military attempts to quarantine the outbreak trapping the survivors inside with the crazed infected. Timothy Olyphant’s performance as the local sheriff trying to keep his family alive against a town of former friends and neighbors turned insane murderers is outstanding and genuine. The Crazies cast does an excellent job building buy-in and investment in their characters, making the audience actually care when one meets their brutal fate. This film is a striking and vicious thriller that belongs at the top of any zombie list."

It stars Edward Arnold, Walter Huston, James Craig, Anne Shirley, Jane Darwell, Simone Simon and Gene Lockhart. Music is by Bernard Herrmann and cinematography by Joseph H. August.\r\n \r\nPoor farmer Jabez Stone (Craig) utters in frustration that he would sell his soul to the devil for two cents such is the destitution he and his family find themselves in. So when the mysterious Mr. Scratch (Huston) turns up with the offer of seven years prosperity, Jabez is only to happy too sign away his soul to Scratch’s contract. Prosperity does indeed come, but also a change in Craig alienates his loved ones, and just what will happen when the seven years are up?\r\n \r\nDieterle’s Faustian movie was met with decent critical notices upon release but failed to make a hit at the box offices. It was subsequently snipped by the studio and reduced from a 107 minute movie to one that was shown in a sub-standard 85 minute cut. Suffice to say that the original cut is really the only version to see, it’s a no brainer.\r\n \r\nI’d fight 10,000 devils to save a New Hampshire man.\r\n \r\nThe Devil and Daniel Webster is a film of surreal and ethereal qualities, qualities that sit snugly alongside the moral core of the tale. The story follows the familiar Faust route, man sells his soul but comes to regret it as his character changes for the worse and promptly wants out of the deal before he has to go live with Old Nick and all his hellish instruments. Here there’s the heavy vibe of America’s soul being fought for, so enter famed lawyer Daniel Webster (Arnold) who rocks up to try to save the now frantic Jabez Stone. Not easy since the jury is a roll call of badness and Mr. Scratch himself is of course a wily old fox.\r\n \r\nThe closing court sequences are just one of many great moments in the piece. Others include a ball at the Stone residence that is tinged with supernatural edginess, a barn dance that is borderline demonic, and Belle’s (a stunningly sensual Simon) disarming dance of death. Herrmann crafts an aural sculpture of a musical score that blends ghostly tensions with tongue in cheek slyness, while Huston, Arnold and Simon give terrific performances. On the negative side Craig is way too animated throughout, irritatingly so, while the set design for 1840s New Hampshire barely passes muster for period oomph. Other than those itches this rounds out as thoroughly enjoyable entertainment. 7.5/10"

        "content": "Shot in 1975, originally for Swedish television, Ingmar Bergman's film ANSIKTE MOT ANSIKTE (Face to Face) explores the idea of a psychiatrist herself struggling with mental illness.\r\n\r\nAs the film opens, Dr. Jenny Isaksson (Liv Ullmann) is standing in an empty house, her family having removed everything in preparation for a move into a new house later that year. In the meantime, her husband is working in America for a few months and her daughter is at a summer camp. Waiting for the family to be reunited and move into the new house, Jenny temporarily settles in with her grandmother (Aino Taube) and grandfather (Gunnar Björnstrand), the latter of whom is poignantly suffering from dementia. Jenny is initially happy to dedicate herself to a new position at the clinic, but soon she finds the wall between reality and delusion breaking down, and the film chronicles her deterioration.\r\n\r\nI personally don't consider ANSIKTE MOT ANSIKTE \"major Bergman\". Firstly, the cut theatrical version feels sputtering and unfocused and consequently its 2-hour length can seem interminable. Sadly, the original television version has never been released, so neither can audiences have that. Secondly, Bergman had made a few films before that dealt with madness or the dark regions of the psyche, and especially in the second half of ANSIKTE MOT ANSIKTE the director resorts to what had already become some cliches for him.\r\n\r\nStill, even second-rate Bergman is worth at least one viewing. In spite of often retreading past ground in showing us what's in Jenny's head, Bergman does at times give us a fresh angle on the theme of mental illness, attempting to convey how much loneliness and shame it involves. Jenny is wracked with emotion but unable to communicate it to those around her, and she feels utterly alone as even those close to her fail to understand her plight. The acting is also superb, with Liv Ullman able to portray a whole spectrum of mental states. Erland Josephson appears in a supporting role, one of the threatening, Mephistophelian characters he did so well.\r\n\r\nThere is, incidentally, one aspect of this film that makes it a real curiosity in Bergman's body of work. Over the preceding couple of decades, Bergman had shot films that were either period films (medieval or early 20th century) or were fairly contained dramas about small, mainly upper-class circles, with little representation of broader society and changing mores. Here, however, the outside world suddenly and rather crudely intrudes on a Bergman film: early on, Jenny attends a party thrown by a campy, somewhat Cathy Berberian-like elderly woman (Sif Ruud) who dotes on a pair of gay men that she has quasi-adopted. The two men are homosexual stereotypes, sashaying, tight jeans and all, and the party involves some sexually libertine folk dancing to Abba-like pop music of the time. One gets the impression that Bergman was feeling challenged by younger filmmakers like Vilgot Sjöman, but this sudden reflection of 1970s Sweden quickly disappears and the film returns to more traditional Bergman territory."

Will they make it there alive?\r\n\r\n\"Cut-Throats Nine\" (1972) is a Spaghetti Western produced by Spaniards with no Italians. It’s infamous for being the most violent & gory Western up to that time. Actually, it was initially filmed without much gore, but the American distributer suggested reshooting certain scenes to make them way grislier. Examples include a slit throat, someone shot in the face, a foot hacked off, ashen corpses and close-up stabbing scenes with entrails. There’s also a rape sequence. Obviously it’s not a fun flick.\r\n\r\nPersonally, the gore doesn’t move me, although I’m sure it was avant-garde at the time and reminiscent of the same in the original “Last House on the Left” (which debuted a month after this film). Disregarding the bloody violence, this is basically a survival story, except with the tone of a non-goofy Spaghetti Western. The wintery setting recalls “Day of the Outlaw” (1959), “The Great Silence” (1968) and “The Hateful Eight” (2015), but this is the least of these.\r\n\r\nIf you can handle the unrelentingly grim and dishonorable milieu, it’s worth checking out. Emma Cohen was certainly a winsome beauty in a girl-next-door kind of way. And I like the serious adventure/survival element. Yet it’s plagued by what usually hindered Euro Westerns back in the day: Caricatures rather than characters, overkill dourness and dubious dubbing with cheesy-stern voices.    \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in northeastern Spain near the border of France at Aragonese Pyreneo, with indoor scenes, etc. done in Madrid. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

The damage done, Wilma covers up her crime and finds her conscience gnawing away at her, especially as she is actively involved in the police investigation…\r\n\r\nGood sturdy story is well played out by a good sturdy cast, The Accused makes up for what it lacks in noir visuals with noir infected psychological smarts. Helps that Wilma Tuttle is a strong characterisation in Young’s excellent hands, the whole film hinging on the fact that Wilma’s crime is perfectly understandable to us viewers, she has our sympathy, more so since she has the chance of love with Cumming’s amiable and cunning lawyer. \r\n\r\nWe follow the police investigation through its various strands of science, with Wilma privy to what is going on as well. This puts a devilish kink to proceedings as Lieutenant Ted Dorgan (Corey) is pretty sure he knows what really happened (an inquest had previously ruled the death as an accident caused whilst diving).\r\n\r\nFurther spice comes with the knowledge that Dorgan also has the hots for Wilma, thus this puts Wilma in a whirlpool of fear and fret, conscience battering and the amorous attentions of two male suitors, both of whom are intricately bound to the investigation. Plus she’s trying to keep it together at work whilst she’s teaching her students psychology!\r\n\r\nIt all builds to a good conclusion, which is nicely open ended, to round production out as an entertaining noirish meller. 7/10\r\n"

Patrick O'Neal, Astrid Heeren, John Carradine and Walter Abel are on hand.  \r\n \r\n\"Silent Night, Bloody Night\" was made in 1970 on a modest budget ($295,000), but not released until 1972. This is an atmospheric horror flick that originated tropes that became staples of the oncoming slasher craze, such as the (possible) killer escaping from an asylum, sexual immorality results in death, disturbing phone calls and naming horror films after a holiday or significant date, à la “Black Christmas” (1974) “Halloween” (1978), “Friday the 13th” (1980), “April Fool's Day” (1986/2008), “Valentine” (2001) and “My Bloody Valentine” (1981/2009).\r\n\r\nUnlike the later “Silent Night, Deadly Night” (1984), this is less of a one-dimensional slasher flick and more artistic horror. Don’t expect Santa Claus stalking victims with an ax. It shares an effective plot element introduced in “Psycho” and “The City of the Dead” (both from 1960).   \r\n\r\nInterestingly, several of the cast members were iconic of Warhol's arty retinue in the 60s, including star Mary Woronov, who married director Theodore Gershuny the same year this movie was made (a marriage that lasted till 1973). Others play either asylum inmates or “guests”: Ondine, Kristen Steen, Tally Brown, Lewis Love, filmmaker Jack Smith, artist Susan Rothenberg and Candy Darling.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Candy, this was her last movie as she died of lymphoma in 1974 at the too-young age of 29. She expressed before her passing, “I am just so bored by everything. You might say bored to death.” Julie Newmar read her eulogy. It was also the last film of costar James Patterson (who was dubbed); he would be dead of cancer three months before the film’s debut.\r\n\r\nWhile some critics call bits of the story a “mess,” practically everything is explained if you put the pieces of the puzzle together (although how someone can walk around for very long with hands literally cut off is a great mystery).\r\n\r\nThe movie is succinct at 1 hour, 21 minutes, and was shot at Mill Neck & nearby Oyster Bay in northwestern Long Island, NY, straight across the sound from the Connecticut panhandle.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/B"

Both leads are on top form; the writing barely comes up for breath as this pacy, engaging comedy comes to a suitably Damoclean conclusion... Great fun!"

It stars Robert Mitchum, Barbara Bel Geddes, Robert Preston, Walter Brennan, Phyllis Thaxter, Frank Faylen, Tom Tully and Charles McGraw. Music is by Roy Webb and cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca. Story has Mitchum as drifting cowboy Jim Garry, who after receiving a job offer in the mail from old acquaintance Tate Riling (Preston), finds himself pitched in the middle of a war between cattle ranchers and homesteaders.\r\n\r\nEffective and tightly crafted Western that has garnered many favourable remarks, due in the main to its ability to veer away from formula suggested by the plot and the technical film noir touches brought about by the great Musuraca. With Mitchum turning in one of his great screen dominating performances, film is driven forward by the psychological aspects brought about by thematics such as duplicity, split loyalties and moral quandaries. Director Wise does a good job of pacing the film, keeping it on the slow burn whilst dialling into Jim Garry's mindset, and picture is further boosted by a great knuckle fight and a rip-roaring siege shoot out at the end. But it's the mood created by Musuraca and Wise that is the real winner. With the film set 90% at night or in darkened rooms, shadow play is high and an oppressive feel adds weight to the psychological clocks ticking away in the narrative. In support of Mitchum, Geddes does spunky cowgirl well, while the presence of Brennan, Faylen and the gravel voiced McGraw is keenly felt.\r\n\r\nGood story, well acted and visually potent. 7/10"

He is initially mistaken as a homosexual cruising for sex, a misunderstanding that Kiarostami even ribaldly encourages through suggestive dialogue. A seminary student refuses to help him because suicide is a sin. I must say that I was very disappointed by these 40 minutes plus. Shooting so much of the film inside the car as Mr. Badi drives around is a waste of the possibilities of cinema. Furthermore, there is no real rapport between Mr. Badi and the various actors, as it was originally Kiarostami sitting in the passenger seat, and the dialogue of the men Mr. Badi picks up was only dubbed in later. The film does largely rely on amateur actors, as is common in Iranian productions from this era. Mr. Badi is played by the architect Homayoun Ershadi, and though Ershadi eventually established a film career, this was his first role.\r\n\r\nThe film does become stronger in the second half, when Kiarostami starts to move from the dusty and barren quarry to more lively scenery of inhabited Tehran, a clear metaphor for the joy and colour of life that Mr. Badi would be giving up if he went through with his plans. The film starts to be thought-provoking instead of merely awkward, and as a glance at discussion forums will show, the film does offer enough to keep cinephiles talking about it. Unfortunately, the ending that Kiarostami chose for the film (which I won't spoil here) feels to me like a cop-out, not to mention something that is already an old auteur trope by now.\r\n\r\nIf you like the Iranian Second Wave, then you'll probably find it worthwhile to see Ta'm-e gilas at least once. However, in spite of its winning of the Palme d'Or, I do not feel this is an especially great film."

The cast includes notables like Mel Ferrer, Stuart Whitman, Carolyn Jones and a young Robert Englund.\r\n\r\nDespite the presence of the croc, “Eaten Alive” (1976) is more of a slasher flick than crocogator horror (the croc is strictly peripheral, not to mention unconvincing). This was Tobe Hooper’s follow-up to his unexpected hit “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974) wherein he borrows the plot of “Psycho” (1960). Unfortunately, he spectacularly fumbles the ball. \r\n\r\nThe surreal style, sets and cast are all good, but there’s a lack of confidence in the execution: The flick’s full of nonsensical actions, meanderings and padding. Hooper tried to make up for it by exploiting the women with lots of raunch & nudity, but “Chainsaw Massacre” proved that a slasher didn’t need this to be effective.\r\n\r\nJanus Blythe stands out in the feminine department as Lynette, as does Roberta Collins as Clara. Marilyn Burns (Faye) and Crystin Sinclaire (Libby) are also noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThankfully, Hooper moved on to much better productions, like “Salem’s Lot” (1979), “The Funhouse” (1981) and “Crocodile” (2000).  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes, and was shot at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, CA.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-/D+"

        "content": "Eaten Alive devours its chance of being a credible creature feature by rarely showing its toothy puppetry. Cult horror is typically hit or miss with my taste in cinema. Quite often, I’ll appreciate and/or understand the adoration for a flick that ages finer that a campy bloody drag act. Conversely, my mind is baffled in the reasoning behind such fondness at the best of times. Hooper’s subsequent work after the impeccable slasher ‘The Texas Chainsaw Massacre’ falls into the latter. Unnecessarily sleazy, underdeveloped maniac-syndrome and useless character choices forces this swampy hotel to be nothing more than a stagnated mess, with surprisingly laughable results. A prostitute is evicted from the town brothel and subsequently finds herself checking in at the decrepit Starlight Hotel, owned by a scythe-wielding maniac and his pet Nile crocodile.\r\n\r\nRaked to death. Scythed through the esophagus. Pushed into mystically inclined water and, you guessed it, eaten alive. Yet despite the repetitive murderous narrative structure, that sees little to no depth in the manager’s antagonistic motives (other than he’s cuckoo), there’s minimal cohesion throughout. Dumb characters check into the most dilapidated hotel available, accompanied by the ethereally strangest bright red light ever, strip so their breasts are on full-display and then encounter “Mr. Croc” (or Judd I think his name was...) who erotically moans his way to the porch where he feeds his pet puppet...I mean crocodile. With no dimensionality in any action he takes, we as the audience are simply watching his maniacal debauchery as a means of entertainment. Problem is, it’s rarely enjoyable when the characters are expendable bones. Even the abnormally shaped dog was immediately dispensable!\r\n\r\nHooper replicated many aspects from his previous directorial efforts. Frantically running around foliage whilst in pursuit by a blade-wielding psychopath, only to then be rescued by a passing vehicle. Bloody infrequent deaths that exercise cheap yet enjoyable, if you’re a sadist like myself, gore that heightens the horror vibes residing within. But the filmmaking and its contents hide in the shadow of ‘The Texas Chainsaw Massacre’, and Eaten Alive can’t seem to chomp its way out.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, it’s a consequence of how underdeveloped these characters are. Example: a fractious couple arrive, with the disturbed husband behaving more unusually than the flippin’ psychotic manager, to which their young daughter flees the scene and hides within the crawlspace of the hotel. For. The. Entire. Film. Screaming at anything that moves an inch, she doesn’t even try to escape knowing full well that the manager is occupied with other guests. Then the sheriff is introduced and doesn’t care about anything, running around his vehicle nonchalantly unconcerned by the bloody mess on the porch calmly stating “are you okay?”. Like heck is she okay! She just got tossed over the banister and scythed twice! Do they look like tears of joy to you? Englund, without his Freddy Krueger attire, arrives and makes love to a girl by stealing keys to a room and ignoring the squeals of a little girl underneath the floorboards? Yeah, I’m done with the characters.\r\n\r\nThe production design clearly emanated an inexpensive set, with the hotel walls looking like they would flake at any moment. Although, Hooper’s score was surprisingly unflinching and, despite the audacious noises made, gave this cult horror some edgy flavour. And the crocodile moving through the crawlspace? Incredibly animate, I must confess.\r\n\r\nHowever, that doesn’t excuse a creature feature without prominently featuring its creature. Sure, less is more, but nothing is nothing. Masochistically sleazy, and naturally campy, yet failed to exercise its full potential by withdrawing any and all bite within its plot."

Despite being in the back of beyond, this little establishment receives it's fair share of visitors and well, yes - you can guess the rest. Meantime, Ferrer - the wealthy \"Wood\" is out searching for his daughter whom he thinks ended up on the game working for the star of the film - \"Miss Hattie\" (Carolyn Jones) who runs the local house of ill-repute. At times this is quite an entertainingly silly romp and I frequently wondered if Jack Elam would have been better in the lead role. There's no jeopardy: of course we all know what happens in the end, but on a big screen with the right amount Malbec in your system, this is quite a watchable ninety minutes of low-budget, studio-shot, cinema that raises the odd smile but certainly not the hairs on the back of your neck."

Gene Barry leads a rather unimpressive cast, however, and that really lets this decent story down somewhat. He wasn't very good at the best of times, and here neither he nor Valerie French's \"Eve\" do justice to the intrigue of the plot.

It stars Lucille Ball, George Sanders, Charles Coburn, Cedric Hardwicke, Joseph Calleia and Boris Karloff. Music is by Michel Michelet and cinematography by William H. Daniels.\r\n\r\nA serial killer in London is murdering young women whom he meets through the personal columns section of the newspaper. Taunting the police with cryptic poems, the killer is proving most illusive, so much so that when a friend of dancer Sandra Carpenter (Ball) disappears, the police enlist her to act as bait to lure the killer in.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot to like about Lured, on proviso you have your expectation level correctly set as to what sort of film it is. It's a very uneven movie in tone, which when one sees that there were four writing contributors involved in bringing it to the screen, perhaps comes as no surprise. A remake of Robert Siodmak's 1939 film Pièges (set in Paris), it is never sure if it wants to be a comedy mystery or a dark brooding thriller. A shame because in spite of it being a set bound production, Sirk and Daniels create a sinister visual mood when the story lurks around the constructed London sets.\r\n\r\nThe cast are ever watchable, though you can see Ball struggling to rein in her natural comedic bent during the more dramatic sequences, but she leads off from the front and looks positively lovely and radiant. Karloff fans get a fun extended cameo, with the great Uncle Boris playing up to a caricature of unstable characters he could do in his sleep, Sanders is suitably stand-offish, Coburn ebullient, while Hardwicke and Calleia add a touch of class to the support ranks.\r\n\r\nMichelet's musical score is in keeping with the mixed tonal flow of the picture, in fact sometimes sounding like it should be in a screwball movie from decades previously, but with competent professionalism coming elsewhere from Sirk, Daniels and the lead cast members, it's an enjoyable movie. Even if it's all a bit too jolly and nonchalant for its own good at times. 6.5/10"

She is drafted in by Scotland Yard to assist them in their investigation of eight girls who have gone missing over recent years; the latter being her friend. The one thing these mysteries may have in common is that each girl was written a poem before they went off the radar, and each may have responded to a lonely-hearts type ad in the newspaper. So \"Sandra\" is tasked with responding to each of these ads with a view to ensnaring our would be kidnapper/murderer (George Zucco is great as her police minder throughout this exercise). This is probably the most enjoyable phase of the film, as she encounters a few of life's more curious folks - not least a wonderful, brief, cameo from Boris Karloff - before she alights on the debonaire George Sanders (or does he alight on her?) and his business partner Sir Cedric Hardwicke. The former certainly fits the bill - he makes his romantic intentions clear from the outset, and when certain seemingly conclusive clues start to appear then Charles Coburn (\"Insp. Temple\") concludes they have their man...but do they? The story is nothing new here, but the cast work well and though hardly menacing, the drama does build well to a cleverly played out endgame. Ball is very far removed from the characterisations she became much more familiar for, and acquits herself well in good company with her co-stars, a decent script and this is well worth a watch"

Once there, he finds himself involved in some intrigues with his host - and his glamorous wife \"Elga\" (Rita Corday) that pits the two in a battle of wits and for survival. Lon Chaney Jr. features as the count's rather dim-witted henchman \"Gargon\" and there a few scene-stealing appearances from Boris Karloff as \"Dr. Meissen\", the well meaning castle physician. Don't expect a horror film, aside from a pool full of hungry of alligators and some medieval instruments of torture, there isn't any - this is just a straight historical drama/romance that pitches good against evil with some sword fighting, good old fashioned treachery and a damsel, frequently, in distress. It isn't Nathan Juran's best - but it's a perfectly competent little adventure yarn to while away 80 minutes."

John Wayne, and chief bad guy George Kennedy appear to merely be going through the motions, and some of the technical work here only compounds the cheap feel that cloaks the story.

But I really enjoyed this gangster/boxing hybrid film from the early 40's that, not only sported great acting by Cagney but also had wonderful performances by Ann Sheridan (I'm rather fond of redheads too), Anthony Quinn and a rare acting role for top-notch director Elia Kazan. Yes, it was melodramatic, a tearjerker and overly predictable--people talk about those qualities as if they were bad things.\r\n\r\nAlso being an aficionado of many types of music, particularly jazz and classical, I found it highly compelling of the filmmakers to utilize music as a way of communicating the inexpressible (the trials and tribulations, dreams and pitfalls). Highly recommended for anyone who likes seeing filmmakers think outside of the box for once, and dare to try something different. Especially if you love Cagney and classic cinema as much as I do, I highly doubt you'll be disappointed."

        "content": "Powerhouse Cagney in melodramatic heart-tugger.\r\n\r\nIf taken purely on script alone the film only amounts up to the usual fare we have seen a zillion times over the years. The basic formula being that two brothers are taking different paths in career choices and the elder brother is doing all he can to help realise his younger brother's dream of being a composer, yet thankfully here the film has a great deal more to offer outside of the usual standard fare.\r\n\r\nThe elder brother boxes to support his young bro's dream but he's tragically almost blinded in a gruelling 15 round fight where foul cheat tactics are used against him. The film then follows the love interest slant of the family & girlfriend closest to our stricken boxer, where thankfully the film manages to stay clear of drowning in a bowl of sickly syrup. Playing out with a very deep emotional heart the film functions so well because of the lead actor. James Cagney was 42 when he made this film, yet he looks like a lithe athletic man in his twenties, such was his commitment to the role. He imbues such gusto into the role of Danny Kenny that he alone demands you watch this film. Cagney is also staunchly supported by Ann Sheridan, Arthur Kennedy, and by a very brash turn from Anthony Quinn. It's a film that tugs on your heart strings at times, and yes it has the audience begging for an uplift in the final reel, but it's done well and delivers all that you had hoped for at the start of the film.\r\n\r\nThe back story doesn't read so well though, Cagney & director Anatole Litvak were continually at war during filming, and most of Cagney's input into the film was cut out. Cagney was so annoyed and sad with the final outcome, he wrote to Aben Kandel (the writer of the novel the film is adapted from) and apologised with sincerity, he need not of worried though for the final result is a very rewarding experience indeed. 8/10"

        "content": "Garbage, all we handle is garbage. \r\n\r\nOn Dangerous Ground is directed by Nicholas Ray and stars Ida Lupino, Robert Ryan & Ward Bond. It's loosely adapted by Ray and A. I. Bezzerides from Gerald Butler's novel Mad With Much Heart. Cinematography is by George E. Diskant & the music is provided by Bernard Herrmann & Paul Sawtell. The story concerns Ryan's weary, lonely and psychologically bothered cop, Jim Wilson. Who after finally snapping the patience of his superiors is sent to Westham in the rural north to aid a murder case there. The idea is to get him off the streets he's so bitter about and to stop him finally going over the violence tinged edge. It's here, amongst the wintry landscapes, that he is brought into contact with Mary Malden (Lupino). A practically blind woman, Mary holds all the keys to the mystery and to the door at the end of Wilson's journey.\r\n\r\nRight from the outset we are in no doubt that Nicholas Ray is about to take us on a noir journey. Herrmann's pulse like score accompanies its nighttime opening, Diskant's photography immediately painting a harsh city where life on the streets is tough. A place where loneliness can eat away at the soul and bleakness pours down off of the bars and the cheaply built apartments. It is in short, firmly encapsulating of Jim Wilson's bitterness and frame of mind. Wilson, once a prime athlete, is mired in solitude, his only telling contribution to society is his work, but that is ebbing away by the day. His mood is not helped by his partners, Pop & Pete, who can easily switch off once their shift has finished; but they have family to go home too, Wilson does not. Wilson's only source of joy comes courtesy of the paperboy he briefly plays football with out on the street (a rare ray of light in the film's moody atmospheric first half).\r\n\r\nThen the film shifts for its second act, a shift that has made On Dangerous Ground a most divisive picture in discussions over the years. Sent north to effectively cool down by Captain Brawley (Ed Begley), we find Wilson leaving behind the dank city and entering the snowbound countryside in the north. Dark has become light as it were. The whole style and pace of the film has changed, yet this is still a place tainted by badness. A girl has been murdered and Wilson is still here to locate potential evil. An evil that the murdered girls father (Ward Bond as Walter Brent) wants to snuff out with his own vengeful fury. As the two men track down the killer, Wilson sees much of himself in Brent's anger, but once the guys arrive at Mary Malden's isolated cabin, things shift just a little more.\r\n\r\nSaid to be a favourite of Martin Scorsese, and an influence for Taxi Driver, On Dangerous Ground has often been called Nicholas Ray's best film by some of his fans (I'd say In A Lonely Place personally). Odd then that Ray himself wasn't happy with the film, calling it a failure and not the finished product he had envisaged. Ray had wanted a three structured movie, not the two part one it is; with the final third being far bleaker and more noirish than the one we actually get. However, and the ending is a bit scratchy for the genre it sits in, it's still a fabulous film that is more about the journey of its protagonist than the diversity caused by its finale. Ryan is terrific, a real powerhouse and believable performance, while Lupino beautifully realises Mary's serene impact on Wilson and the counter opposite to the darkness within the picture. It's a given really, but Herrmann's score is potent, listen out for the opening, the crossover section from city to countryside and the rock face pursuit. While Ray directs with his customary knack of blending the grim with the almost poetic. 8/10"

It stars William Lundigan, Dorothy Patrick, Jeff Corey, Nestor Paiva and Paul Guilfoyle. Music is by Leonid Raab and cinematography by Robert De Grasse.\r\n\r\nA serial killer known as \"The Judge\" is stalking the city, his modus operandi is to strike when it rains and to kill by strangulation. The police have loads of little clues but nothing solid to go on. The strain is starting to weigh heavy on Lt. Harry Grant (Lundigan), but he comes up with a genius idea to help catch the killer - a mannequin!\r\n\r\nNot widely known, but once released to MOD home format it got more noticed and has been keenly sought out by fans of the great Anthony Mann. It has proved a little divisive so this fawning review should be taken with a little context. Clocking in at just under an hour in length, Fleischer's film is by definition a compact RKO \"B\" picture, but the quality of story, and the little slices of noir craft, ensure it's got plenty of strengths going for it.\r\n\r\nIn essence it's an early police procedural dealing with the hunt for a serial killer. There's a babe in the mix, Dorothy Patrick as an intrepid reporter who announcers herself to the film wearing a see through mackintosh, which of course is splendid. She teams up with Grant, not as a fatale, but as a sort of wry cohort, suggestion is evident, sexual tension even, but nothing is shoe-horned in to the pic. The cops are all stoic types, splendidly attired for period delights, but it's with Lundigan's head of investigations where the film gets its pulse beat. He gets in deep with the psychological aspects of the case, thinking like the killer, talking to the faceless mannequin that has been constructed out of clues left by the killer, the mirror images of the killer and mannequin are not exactly a million miles away from Lundigan himself. Cheeky is that.\r\n\r\nMann's stamp is all over the film, but Fleischer's work is evident for sure, an economical purist meets the crafty auteur, a fine match. Robert De Grasse (The Body Snatcher/Born to Kill) is a key component, operating with angles and shades when required, there's a distinct uneasy feel to proceedings. A few scenes grab the attention with full effect, akin to a spider inviting a fly to dinner, which all builds to a head, culminating in a blunderbuss finale at an oil refinery - cum - power plant. Only where White Heat (also 1949) went nighttime for its coup de grace, Follow Me Quietly did it in daylight. Cheeky is that.\r\n\r\nIt's not perfect. Some logic holes are there as regards the water effect with the killer, which also leads us to lament a lack of reasoning and understanding with the perpetrator. There's also a couple of instances where the mannequin is played in a rear shot by a real actor, why? I have no idea. While the best scene in the film, as Lundigan chats to the dummy in a darkened room - and the rain falls hard on the windows - brings about a reveal that makes no sense what so ever. Especially once \"The Judge\" is revealed. However, this is easy to recommend to noir heads and fans of police procedurals, and I loved it. 8/10"

        "content": "Co-writers Ian McKellen and Richard Loncraine (who also directs) set their Richard III in 1930s Britain, and make the infamous hunchback a fascist warmonger plotting to usurp the throne. Today's English monarchy is, at best, nominal, but even way back in the 1930s there wasn't much to be gained by usurping it.\r\n\r\nThen again, the film takes place in an alternate reality where the War of the Roses occurs 450 years after the true historical conflict did. I don’t mind so much that royalty has endured those four centuries and a half; what does bother me is that language has not evolved in the interim at the same rate as, say, warfare. Why on Earth would Richard (McKellen), who is neither dumb nor crazy, use the expression “my kingdom for a horse” when he could be asking for a tank instead?\r\n\r\nThis line is only in the movie because it’s in the play – but then, a great many things that are in the play aren’t in the film, and viceversa, so why keep this particular bit? I mean, it couldn’t be because the audience is expecting it, even though it makes zero sense given the circumstances, could it? Did they think diehard Shakespeare fans would riot otherwise? Well, if there were such a thing as hardcore Shake-heads, I assure you they would have rioted long before this point.\r\n\r\nSimilarly outdated is a scene in which several characters who have been at each other’s throats are compelled to swear mutual oaths of loyalty. As Al Pacino’s superb documentary Looking for Richard rightly points out, at the time that the original play is set this would be serious business, because only people who want to go to hell would swear an oath and not keep it. Ditto the scene where Richard blames his deformity on Queen Elizabeth's witchcraft; this is an accusation that would have been given credence in the 1470s, but not so much in the 1930s.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, it’s somewhat ironic that McKellen had a hand in the script, because his performance is worthy of much better material. His body language, in particular, is priceless – this Richard looks like a super-intelligent ape masquerading as a British Army field marshal. And when he breaks the fourth wall – another device that works better on a theater stage –, it feels as if Richard is letting the viewers in on that the entire movie is a sick joke he's playing on the other characters. If only."

Actually \"From Justin to KellY\" (2003) is a fun musical/beach film in the manner of Elvis films and the 60's beach flicks. One look at the movie poster and it's obvious.\r\n\r\nWhen viewing films of this ilk it's time to just kick back, turn off your brain and have a good time. On this level \"From Justin to Kelly\" works fabulously. It's pretty much just as good or better than any Elvis or beach movie you can think of. Filmed in the Miami/Ft. Lauderdale area, the story deals with the romantic adventures of youths on Spring Break. Keeping with the traditions of the genre there's no raunch or moronic sex/bathroom humor; the film has an appealing innocence.\r\n\r\nAnother highlight is that there are more gorgeous bikini-clad babes per minute than most movies out there (dudes too, if you're a woman).\r\n\r\nTo be expected, the songs featured are all substance-less modern pop ditties ('modern' as in the early 2000s, which hasn't changed much today). I don't normally listen to this kind of music, but it fits the upbeat and fun vibe of the film.\r\n\r\nI'm hardly an American Idol aficionado but I admit that I did enjoy the show when I occasionally viewed it with my wife. And Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini, the two stars of the film, were two of the more likable \"idols.\". (I also confess to liking Katharine McPhee, Bo Bice, Carrie Underwood, Chris Daughtry, Kelly Pickler and Clay Aiken). (I'm just joking about Aiken, lol). To be expected, Kelly and Justin aren't the best actors but they're not bad either, particularly as the story proceeds; the quality of the acting certainly doesn't prevent you from enjoying the flick. They did a fine job all things considered.\r\n\r\nOne can't bring up American Idol without mentioning the ever-present Kimberly Caldwell (from the channel station). She's an undeniably good-looking woman but she tends to grate on the nerves. The reason I bring her up is, if you've ever secretly fantasized about seeing her chopped in half, be sure to check out the goofy gorefest \"Wrong Turn 2: Dead End\" (2007) (I'd call it a horror film but it's way too silly and over-the-top to be horrifying). This film makes your fantasies come true, literally.\r\n\r\nThe DVD features the 81-minute fullscreen version of the film whereas as well as the 90-minute extended widescreen cut, which has a few extra dance numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you're in the mood for an innocent beach flick turn your brain off and enjoy!\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

But once contact is made, and surveillance set up over the road from her apartment complex, Sheridan begins to fall in love and lust with the sultry femme.\r\n\r\nComparisons with the superior Double Indemnity are fair enough, but really there is enough here, and considerable differences too, for the film to rightfully be judged on its own merits. Also of note to point out is that one or two critics have questioned if Pushover is actually a film noir piece? Bizarre! Given that character motives, destinies and thematics of plot are quintessential film noir.\r\n\r\nA good but weary guy is emotionally vulnerable and finds his life spun into a vortex of lust, greed and murder. Yet the femme fatale responsible, is not a rank and file manipulator, she too has big issues to deal with, a trophy girlfriend to a crook, she coarsely resents this fact. The cop who never smiles and the girl who has forgotten how too, is there hope there? Do they need the money that has weaved them together? What does that old devil called fate have in store for them? Classic noir traits do pulse from the plot. True, the trajectory the pic takes had been a well trodden formula in noir by the mid fifties, where noir as a strong force was on the wane, but this holds up very well.\r\n\r\nIt isn't just a piece solely relying on two characters either, there's the concurrent tale of Sheridan's voyeuristic partner Rik McAllister (Carey), who has caught the eye of Lona's next door neighbour, Ann Stewart (Malone). Both these characters operate in a different world to the other two, yet the question remains if a relationship can be born out from such shady beginnings? The presentation of relationships here is delightfully perverse. The visual style wrung out by Quine (Drive a Crooked Road) and White (5 Against the House) is most assuredly noir, with 99% of the film set at night, with prominent shadows, damp streets lit by bulbous lamps and roof top scenes decorated sparsely by jutting aerials. The L.A. backdrop a moody observer to the unwrapping of damaged human goods.\r\n\r\nCast are very good, all working well for their reliable director. Novak sizzles in what was her first credited starring role, she perfectly embodies a gal that someone like Paul Sheridan could lose his soul for. MacMurray is suitably weary, his lived in face telling of a life lacking in genuine moments of pleasure. Carey, square jawed, tall and handsome, he is the perfect foil to MacMurray's woe. Malone offers the potential ray of light trying to break out in this dark part of America, while Marshall as tough Lieutenant Eckstrom and Allen Nourse as a copper riding the noir train to sadness, score favourably too.\r\n\r\nIt opens with a daylight bank robbery and closes in true noir style on a cold and wet night time street. Pushover, deserving to be viewed as one of the more interesting 1950s film noirs. 8/10"

        "content": "I always felt that Fred MacMurray was a bit of a lurch as an actor. Never particularly versatile nor charismatic to watch. Here, though, he is pretty effective as the undercover cop \"Sheridan\". Things hot up for his character when he encounters the enigmatic \"Lona\" (Kim Novak) and soon they are having a passionate affair. What we soon find out is that she is the gal of a thief behind a $200k robbery and he is supposed to be using her to get to her beau. When she discovers he is a policeman she tries to make sure that he is, and stays, in her corner. He, on the other hand, has a job to do - or does he? This packs loads into ninety minutes with a decent amount of intrigue and plenty of raw greed as you are never quite sure who (if anyone) is going to betray whom. Novak is also on good form as is the sparingly used Dorothy Malone and E.G. Marshall as his streetwise lieutenant \"Eckstrom\". Richard Quine manages to sustain the suspense well right until the end of this superior crime-noir that boasts a better than average plot and script and is well worth a gander."

Take out the oddness and there's not much there, I feel.\r\n\r\nWith that said, it undoubtedly leaves an imprint and does what it intends to so I guess it levels out to be something worth watching. Clint Eastwood gives an almost eerily convincing performance, while those behind him are all solid - with the standouts, to me, being Geraldine Page and Mae Mercer.\r\n\r\nIt's certainly 'out there', you gotta give it that.

The intrepid reporter with a quip on the lips and a disdain for the unbelievers in the suit wearing echelons, is now in Seattle and quickly realises that the current spate of killings are more than just the work of a serial killer. But can he convince the authorities of this?\r\n\r\nThe formula is exactly the same here, Kolchak simultaneously locks horns with his editor and all the law enforcement people in his arc. He does a voice over for us, proves to be clearly better than the law officers in charge of the case, drops sarcasm as pearls of wisdom, and of course has charisma in abundance. The difference here is that the villain, elegantly played by Richard Anderson, has a voice, a sort of Count Dracula for the modern setting, a Eugene Tooms in embryonic form, he's a great villain and this in turn gives Kolchack more to get his teeth into. Of course the ending is never in doubt, but there's a whole bunch of fun and 70s style scares to enjoy during the ride. \r\n\r\nJoining the ever enjoyable McGavin are Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland (again great foil for McGavin), Scott Brady, Wally Cox, Margaret Hamilton and John Carradine. A TV series would follow, such was the popularity of the character and its monster of the week formula, and it would influence none other than The X-Files some years down the line.

Intrepid reporter Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) discovers that the same kinds of murders occur every 21 years dating back to the late 1800s.  Simon Oakland plays Kolchak’s bellowing boss while Jo Ann Pflug appears as a genial belly dancer who assists Carl. Scott Brady plays the police captain while Wally Cox is on hand as a helpful scribe. Richard Anderson has a key role.\r\n\r\n“The Night Strangler” was the follow-up to the highly successful “The Night Stalker” (1972) and led to a series that ran for one season from 1974-1975 (20 episodes), not to mention numerous Kolchak books. The two pilot movies are the best of the batch and established the template (formula) for the series and books.\r\n\r\nLike the first film, there’s a lot of intrigue, action, ravishing women, horror and suspense, plus a percussion-oriented jazzy score that’s even better. “The Night Strangler” adds a little effective comedy and the antagonist is more complicated. The underground lair is mysterious and the mummified family is creepy, but the details of the alchemist’s elixir and strategy seem contrived.\r\n\r\nIt’s good to have Kolchak team-up with someone (cutie Pflug), which rarely happens in the ensuing series, but it was welcome when it did (“The Energy Eater” and “Demon in Lace”). There are a few peripheral beauties (Regina Parton, Nina Wayne and Francoise Birnheim), which the rest of the series mostly lacked, except for the debut episode, “The Ripper,” and \"The Werewolf.\"\r\n\r\nSince this is a TV flick from the early 70s don’t expect much gore.        \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 90 minutes (with the original TV release more streamlined at 74 minutes) and was shot in Seattle and the Bradbury Building in downtown, Los Angeles, with studio work done at 20th Century Fox Studios.

One night while attending the local carnival with her jock boyfriend (played by character actor Craig Wasson), she is singled out in the crowd while her boyfriend is engaging in a game of Dunk The Bozo. The Bozo in question is Frankie,played by Gary Busey, who sits in a dunk tank waiting for the 'marks' (victims of hustlers) to throw the balls that hit the spot so that he falls into the water. There are other hustlers too that each run their own game. Keeping everything under control is Patch,played by legendary guitarist and songwriting musician Robbie Robertson,who as his character's name suggests,patches things over from everything to paying off city officials to organizing plans with the local crime boss.\r\nProblems arise when Frankie tells Patch that Donna will be accompanying them along the circuit. Patch is not pleased and organizes a plan to get Donna out of the picture. A series of mishaps ensue,which Patch blames on Donna. Patch then tries to tell the man running the strip tent that Donna can 'work strong ' meaning take her clothes off rather than be a back up dancer for the strippers,as Donna thinks she will be that evening. A riot breaks out and Patch realizes that he went too far after Donna gets hurt. Further tensions arise when Frankie catches Donna and Patch in flagrante one night. Patch and Frankie are at odds but not for long. A surprise ending rounds out this film but it is left wide open with room for a sequel that didn't ever materialize.\r\nAll in all, Carny is a good depiction of the lives of carnival workers and their respective con artist attitudes."

Tucker is approached by the mysterious Tagge (Richard Widmark), who offers to spring Tucker out of jail if he will simply follow a few orders, and eventually kill a man in cold blood.

Tucker gets involved in what would today be described as \"the deep state,\" who always seem to be a step ahead of him in order to get him to do their bidding. Of course, as with any mediocre political thriller, Tucker doesn't play by their rules.\r\n\r\nWhile Hackman is one of my favorite actors, this film is not up to par. The name cast is fine, look for Eli Wallach, Edward Albert, Jay Novello, and Majel Barrett in support, but Adam Kennedy's story is dull. Based on his novel, the film makers try to get us to care about Tucker and Ellie's original crime that got the both of them locked up. The screenplay can't generate any suspense or paranoia, instead we get endless scenes of Hackman wandering around and looking over his shoulder a lot. The viewer is kept in the dark as much as Tucker is, so once Tucker receives his \"assignment,\" I really didn't care. There's a twist about the assassination that completely invalidates the film's plot, rendering the hour and forty minutes a waste of time. Director Stanley Kramer has done some classic films, but he stumbles here; what should have been some glorious action set pieces are mishandled.\r\n\r\n\"The Domino Principle\" tries to squeeze itself into a crowded genre that included \"The Parallax View,\" \"The Eiger Sanction,\" \"The Odessa File,\" and other similarly titled films. Too bad the film makers seem as interested in the proceedings as we are.

It's the type of film that one knows is not about winning awards, the kind of film that is an actors film, where everyone is comfortable with the material and appears to be having a great time. The lead role of Kendig is tailor made for Matthau, ambling along at his own pace with a glint in his eye and a quip on his tongue, Matthau carries the film with charming ease. The others all contribute of course, but the comedy gold comes from Walter and that lived in face of his. So bits of drama here, bits of comedy there, Hopscotch is a very well made and hugely enjoyable picture, recommended. 7/10"

The production is pleasing to look like, and the score sets up some lovely Scottish location photography. The cast? Well, Hawkins looks like he has had way too much port; Trevor Howard is quite effective as the duplicitous Lord Advocate and the young Douglas does fine as the naive but decent young \"Balfour\". It is all about Michael Caine, though - and for all it's many flaws, there is no denying that the solid underpinning adventure story serves as a strong enough bedrock for this not to end up the laughable nonsense it could have been.

Under questionable orders, the US Colonel in charge of the situation (Burt Lancaster) reroutes the train to Poland where it has to cross a long defunct steel arch bridge.    \r\n\r\n“The Cassandra Crossing” (1976) is a disaster thriller that’s part train movie and part plague flick. It’s not great like the later “Runaway Train” (1985) nor as good as “Outbreak” (1995), but it’s almost on par with “Under Siege 2: Dark Territory” (1995). \r\n\r\nBesides Lancaster as the Colonel, the impressive cast includes: Ingrid Thulin as the doctor the Colonel contends with; Richard Harris as a famous neurologist; Sophia Loren his ex-wife; Lee Strasberg a Holocaust survivor; Ava Gardner a wealthy aging lady; Martin Sheen her dubious boy toy; OJ Simpson a “priest”; Ann Turkel a hippie-ish musician; and John Phillip Law the Colonel’s subordinate.  \r\n\r\nComparing this to the highest standard of 70’s disaster flicks, “The Poseidon Adventure” (1972), it’s just not as compelling because “Poseidon” has superior human interest, a more remarkable challenge and better women. Parts of it are quite good though, even great, like the superb sky-view cinematography and the score by Jerry Goldsmith. The last act is thrilling and worth the price of admission, but the first 90 minutes contains too many tedious parts with characters you don’t much care about.\r\n\r\nSophia still looks good at 41 during filming whereas Richard Harris was 45, but looks older. Gardner was 53 during shooting and also looks older, but then the last movie I saw her in debuted a dozen years earlier wherein she was still alluring. Hey, age happens.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 8 minutes. Interiors were shot at Cinecittà studios in Rome with exteriors done in France and Switzerland. The steel arch bridge pictured in the movie is in reality the Garabit Viaduct in southern France, designed by Gustave Eiffel in 1880-1884, who later constructed the Eiffel tower.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

It stars Gene Hackman, Jennifer Warren, Susan Clark, James Woods, Melanie Griffith, Edward Binns, Harris Yulin, Kenneth Mars and Janet Ward. Music is by Michael Small and cinematography by Bruce Surtees.\r\n\r\nFormer footballer turned private detective in Los Angeles Harry Moseby (Hackman), gets hired by an ageing actress to track down her trust-funded daughter Delly Grastner (Griffith), who is known to be in Florida. With his own personal life shaken by his wife's infidelity, Harry dives into the Grasten case with determination. Unfortunately nothing is as it first seems and it's not long before Harry is mired in murky goings on...\r\n\r\nIt sounds kind of bleak. Or is it just the way you tell it?\r\n\r\nThe locale is often bright and sunny but that's about the only thing that is in this excellent neo-noir. Harking back, and doffing its cap towards, the noir detective films of the classic cycle, Night Moves is ripe with characters who are either dubious or damaged. Protagonist Harry Moseby is thrust into a melancholic world that he has no control over, but he doesn't know this fact. As the mystery at the core of the dense plot starts to unravel, there's a bleakness, a 1970s air of cynicism, that pervades the narrative. Culminating in a finale that's suitably dark and ambiguous.\r\n\r\nHarry thinks if you call him Harry again he's gonna make you eat that cat!\r\n\r\nAlan Sharp's (Ulzana's Raid) terrific screenplay is appropriately as sharp as a razor. Dialogue is often hardboiled or zinging with wit, and the conversations come with sadness or desperation. Be it chatter about a fateful chess move, sexual enlightenment or the pains of childhood and bad parenting, Sharp's writing provides fascinating characters operating in a tense thriller environment.\r\n\r\nListen Delly, I know it doesn't make much sense when you're sixteen. Don't worry. When you get to be forty, it isn't any better.\r\n\r\nArthur Penn brilliantly threads it all together, as he hones a great performance out of Hackman and notable turns from the support players, he smoothly blends action with pulsing unease. There's nudity on show, but in Penn's hands it is never used for gratuitous purpose, it represents dangerous fantasies or dented psyches. Small's jazzy score is a fine tonal accompaniment, and Surtees' Technicolor photography provides deft mood enhancements for the interior and exterior sequences.\r\n\r\nBiting and bitter, Night Moves is essential neo-noir. 9/10"

He should have just made another \"Death Wish\" movie, instead. \r\n\r\nBased on a true story set in 1969, Bronson plays United Mine Workers union official Jock Yablonski. He fawns over union president Tony Boyle (Wilford Brimley), who is made out to be a ruthless crook immediately. As Jock and his wife Margaret (Ellen Burstyn) coast through life, a mine accident claims the lives of eighty people. Boyle arrives in the grieving West Virginia town and defends the coal company over the miners.\r\n\r\nYablonski is almost run out of town, and decides he has had enough. He announces his candidacy for the union presidency, and begins campaigning. Boyle then orders a hit on his former friend.\r\n\r\nThe film shifts gears and introduces us to Paul (Robert Schenkkan), a house painter with a lot of guns and a huge ego. Paul is married to the oversexed Annette (Ellen Barkin), who is probably carrying on behind Paul's back. Annette's father Silous (Hoyt Axton) comes to Paul with a job- kill Yablonski and collect ten thousand dollars. Annette uses her feminine wiles to convince Paul, and he hires local petty criminal Claude (Maury Chaykin) to help.\r\n\r\nWith the campaign in full swing, both sides are confident about victory. Boyle's side is more confident since he has stuffed the ballot box, winning in a landslide. Yablonski decides to challenge the election, and his death becomes more important to Boyle and his gang. Paul hires another killer Buddy (Keanu Reeves), and the trio decide to carry out their plan.\r\n\r\nWith a good cast and confident direction, this film really should have hit its mark. Unfortunately, it never seems to get momentum going, as the central plot about the campaign takes a back seat to the killers' subplot.\r\n\r\nThe staged campaign speeches are, well, stagey. The crowd scenes never move, and Boyle is so evil right away, the election's outcome is never in doubt. Bronson tries, but his dramatic scenes are just like other action films he has done, except he does not pull out a gun. Burstyn is wasted in the dutiful wife role, I have a feeling stronger writing would have bolstered her part.\r\n\r\nThe best performance here? Writer/actor Robert Schenkkan as Paul. He turns Paul into such a desperate loser, he would be pitiful if his actions were not so despicable. One creepy scene has him humping a sleeping Annette to calm his urges, and Annette obviously knows what a little oral sex will do to better her station in life.\r\n\r\nClaude and Buddy are also disgusting creatures, there are plenty of opportunities to kill Yablonski but Claude chickens out. Claude and Paul make the trip to the Yablonski's country house so often, they know where to stop for gas.\r\n\r\nClaude, Paul, and Buddy eventually cross over into \"funny\" territory, and that is where the film finally lost me. The final violent scenes show the trio bumbling like the unfunny \"I Love You to Death,\" but the humor is completely wrong here. \r\n  \r\nBarely an hour and a half, \"Act of Vengeance,\" a generic name that could serve as a \"Death Wish\" subtitle, never grabs its audience and proves to be an exercise in predictability, despite the excellent work of Robert Schenkkan.

This is bad news for police captain Alcoa (Danny Aiello).\r\n\r\nAiello stands out in the usually thankless job of 'straight man', to the point that his best scene, and arguably the best in the film, is not among those he shares with Steiger and Keitel, or with Kline and Alan Rickman, but the one wherein he reacts with increasing bewilderment when a subordinate attempts to explain why Nick turned down the office that was assigned to him.\r\n\r\nRickman plays Ed, a painter/computer whiz. Nick and Ed discover that the location of the buildings where the victims lived, when viewed on a map of Manhattan, form the constellation Virgo. They also realize that all of the rooms in which the murders occurred have windows on the front of the building, and that when the exterior location of the windows are aligned based on the floor they are on, they correlate with eleven notes in the chorus of the song “Calendar Girl”.\r\n\r\nThat the occupant of the apartment is always a woman who is always home alone the night of the attack (the killer acts on dates that are prime numbers) is arguably the least of all the coincidences in the movie, but then The January Man has not the slightest interest in creating a plausible villain, and that in an all-star cast, also including Susan Sarandon and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, the anonymous killer is played by a stunt double, tells us everything we need to know about the importance this character had for the filmmakers."

Onward and upward! \r\n\r\nBrighton Beach Memoirs is directed by Gene Saks and adapted to the screen from his own play by Neil Simon. It stars Jonathan Silverman, Blythe Danner, Judith Ivey, Bob Dishy, Stacey Glick, Lisa Waltz and Brian Dillinger. Music is by Michael Small and cinematography by John Bailey.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of what would become a trilogy of films detailing the adventures and learnings of Neil Simon's life trajectory. His alias in the three productions comes in the guise of Eugene Morris Jerome, here played by Silverman, and by Matthew Broderick in Biloxi Blues (1988) and Corey Parker in Broadway Bound (1992). This is set in 1937 Brooklyn, New York, and finds Eugene, a Polish-Jewish American youngster experiencing sexual awakening in a family home packed to the rafters.\r\n\r\nHaving never seen a Neil Simon play before I have no frame of reference, either here or with Biloxi Blues, the latter of which is a personal favourite. So taking it on its filmic terms only, it delivers much of the requisite razor sharp humour that was a trait of the hugely talented writer. The young version of Eugene here has sporting dreams as well as that of being a professional writer, his literary bent evident in his vocal discourse with his family and us on the fourth wall. He's the family gofer, a slave to his adoring but firm handed mother, as if battling the on-set of puberty wasn't taxing enough! \r\n\r\nThough primarily humourous in narrative drive, the serious side of family values is always a strong current within. Gambling addiction also features, so to does vivid sibling rivalry later in life, while the dangling thread of Polish family members trying to exit their homeland for a better life in New York strikes a poignant chord. I can't vouch for accents or adherence to natural race standards, but the sense of the period and areas (real location filming of course) is impressive - the cast uniformly tight to the material's various themes.\r\n\r\nObviously not for everyone, but for those not bothered by closeness to the play, and those who love the sort of zingy dialogue found in other Simon film adaptations, then this hits the spot for sure. 8/10"

But not in a modern hurtful way. Myrna I remember easily from the Thin Man films and she is a natural at this. She deadpans a lot of her lines, but check out her facial expressions.

His partner Joe Worth feels it's time to call it quits, a row over finances ensues and a fire breaks out and burns the museum to the ground, almost killing Igor in the process. On to 1933 and New York, where the wheelchair bound Igor has a new museum open, the figures sculpted by others under his guidance due to his horribly disfigured hands preventing him from crafting himself. When a female socialite dies and her body is stolen from the morgue, ballsy reporter Florence Dempsey starts to investigate. Could it be that the stealing of the body is linked to the opening of Igor's new museum? \r\n\r\nMystery of the Wax Museum was long thought to have had it's elements lost in a (ironically) fire, so with no Technicolor negative or prints available, it was a cinematic godsend that a used print was discovered in Jack Warner's private vault. The UCLA Film and Television Archive restored the film, and now the film can be seen in all its former glory. Riding in on a high reputation, the restored film was met with less than favourable results by the critics, possibly due in some part to the rightful regard that the remake, House Of Wax 1953, was held. What it is safe to say is that the film is more of a mystery (the clue is in the title!) than an outright horror. Something I don't think many were prepared for. \r\n\r\nThe critics derision back then is now on reflection, stupid. For it's a truly fine film from an interesting era in film making. The sets from Anton Grot are brilliant, Gothic pieces of work. While the performance of Lionel Atwill as Igor is superb, and arguably his best work. The actress' do well enough, Fay Wray (reuniting with Atwill again after their work in Dr X in 1932) as Charlotte Duncan hones her scream queen method, and Glenda Farrell is ebullient and sharp tongued as Dempsey. There's also daring themes involved in the story, necrophilia, drug addiction, insanity and bootlegging. With the horror elements of the piece born out by the grizzly secrets of Igor's museum. It's also not just an important film in the pantheon of colour pictures, but also in that it has a modern city setting. Helping to bring horror to the streets instead of some ye olde village or faraway castle. It's a smashing mystery/horror film that is now thankfully widely available on various DVDs, so see it if you can. 8/10"

As difficult as it is to emotionally engage with, 'Waterloo' is still an impressive production, all the more so as a demonstration of Sergei Bondarchuk's remarkable ability for balancing the inner world of his characters and the spiritual horror of war with the ultimate expression of the epic in cinema.

Rod Steiger is superbly cast and imperious as the maniacal but genius French Emperor who very nearly conquered the mainland continent of Europe, despite the comprehensive alliance lined up against him - and led, at the denouement, but his nemesis the Duke of Wellington (Christopher Plummer). Some considerable effort has gone into designing and delivering this whole spectacle of a film - from the grand palatial settings, the costumes, intricate uniforms - and the battle scenes are as authentic as I've seen since that other Napoleonic epic \"Austerlitz\" (1960). Steiger portrays the Emperor in a characterful and personal fashion; he is full of the megalomaniac but also the portrayal indicates a little more of what made the great man tick (or not). Having read somewhat more about Wellington (I'm a Brit), I was somewhat disappointed by the slightly smug - almost foppish - portrayal of the \"Grand Old\" Duke by Plummer. He looked the part, but somehow his efforts were always outshone onscreen - by the fleeting appearances of Jack Hawkins, the glamorous Virginia McKenna - even by a squealing piglet. That said, though - this is a film about a battle and the action scenes are superb. They look and sound genuine engendering no end of sympathy for the soldiers who served as little more than cannon/bullet/bayonet fodder as they marched around (and fell) in the mud. The narrative is quite tight; we don't get distracted by too many romantic interludes or other daft diversions, and once it gets up steam it is an effective depiction of a pretty gruesome conflagration that history (for the winners, at any rate) has successfully sanitised. Bit long, we could do with less of the preamble, but once it gets going it presents a convincing effort from Steiger and is well worth watching as an example of large scale epic cinema before the computer took over the role of the extras, the sets, the story...."

        "content": "_**The best (and only) major film about downhill ski racing**_\r\n\r\nRobert Redford was in his prime as David Chappellet, a taciturn loner from Colorado, who competes with an underdog American team for Olympic gold in Europe. Gene Hackman co-stars as the coach who tries to temper Chappellet's narcissistic and reckless drive for glory.\r\n\r\n\"Downhill Racer\" came out late in 1969 hot on the heels of Redford's success with \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" Unfortunately it wasn't marketed properly and failed at the box office, but don't let that deter you 'cause this is a great film well worthy of your time.\r\n\r\nAlthough the movie is from '69 and therefore has obvious dated aspects, \"Downhill Racer\" was very innovative in it's time and holds up well to this day. In fact, aside from the ski paraphernalia & styles, I don't find the film dated at all. It somehow has a fresh quality and plays out like a docudrama similar to, say, \"Saving Private Ryan,\" which was made nigh three decades later(!).\r\n\r\n\"Downhill Racer\" is reminiscent of 1966's \"The Blue Max\" in that both films are about an unlikable loner who is ruthlessly ambitious in his area of skill and functions as a fish out of water in the social circles to which he's thrust. It goes without saying that if you liked \"The Blue Max\" you'll probably like this one too. Both rank with my favorite films of all time.\r\n\r\nDownhill racing is an insanely hazardous sport in that the skier can reach speeds of 80-90 mph(!). Needless to say, one bad fall could take you out for life. Downhill is also an extremely individualistic sport, which is well pointed out in the story when a teammate criticizes Chappellet for not being a team player and another guy responds, \"Well, it isn't exactly a team sport, is it?\" Needless to say, it takes a very certain kind of individual to be successful at downhill -- someone who's ultra-daring and bold; someone with a wild, reckless edge balanced by the necessary discipline to train and compete. \r\n\r\nRedford effectively plays such a person here. He rises up in the ranks to become the American team's only true hopeful; the coach attempts to somewhat keep him under reigns and criticizes his individualism and recklessness even while he knows these are the very qualities that makes him a winner. Throughout the picture Chappellet and the coach act like they don't like each other at all, and it's true because Chappellet is a loner in the truest sense, but ultimately the coach is squarely on the young racer's side: When it comes time for the vital Olympic run the coach looks into Chappellet's eyes and confidently states, \"You can win this.\"\r\n\r\nTake note of the stark contrast of Chappellet's plain hometown in Colorado and the glitz of the European ski resorts where he races. Also contrasted is Chappellet's throw-away hometown girl (\"Do ya have some more of that gum\") and the glamorous self-absorbed babe he hooks up with in Europe (Camilla Sparv of \"Mackenna's Gold\" fame); she gives him a good taste of his own bad self, if you know what I mean. Also of interest is his 'relationship' with his distant father, a simple country man who doesn't understand his son's preoccupation with skiing and the lack of financial gain thereof.\r\n\r\nWhile watching, I couldn't help but think of Bill Johnson, the unlikely downhill gold medal winner for the USA in the '84 Olympics. Like Chappellet he was cocky & reckless and irked the European snobs with his bold predictions of Olympic victory. I have no doubt that \"Downhill Racer\" was one of Bill's favorite films. Unfortunately Mr. Johnson staged an improbable comeback bid for the 2002 Olympics that ended abruptly with a horrible downhill crash in March, 2001, leaving him permanently brain-damaged and in need of constant care. How the mighty have fallen!\r\n\r\nOne cavil I have with \"Downhill Racer\" is that Redford is playing a person in his early 20s while he was 32 years-old during filming and looks it. But this is just nitpicking. Besides, Redford looks great at 32 or any age (and I say that with a staunch record of heterosexuality).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 41 minutes."

The former guy is a gay hooker who's got by on the streets using his looks and his wits whilst contracting HIV along the way. The latter man is a journalist who has managed to arrive at the same fate - though not as a result of the same s(t)eamy existence. With nothing much left to lose, the unlikely pairing embark on a fairly hedonistic journey that pitches their two completely different personalities into a series of scenarios that ultimately, well you can guess what ends up happening. It doesn't pull it's punches this. It is gritty and sleazy and honest and illustrates well just how human beings react when faced with certainty - even if it's timeline isn't so set in stone. It's a love story, an hate story - and juggles loads of attitudinal and judgemental horrors as the two men meet homophobia and violence as they begin to rely more and more on each other (whilst simultaneously winding each other up fairly spectacularly). There's a bit of sex - nothing very graphic, and loads of ripe language - but nothing here appears gratuitous. It's a plausible road trip that Greg Araki has constructed to make us think, squirm, smile and well, endure too. It won't be for everyone, but it does remind us of how, just 20-odd years ago, AIDS was still killing people and there is a definite and engaging chemistry between the two actors charged with delivering this story of a messy and frequently anachronistic existence."

        "content": "A funny story about 6 and 9.\r\n\r\n6ixtynin9 (Ruang talok 69) is without doubt a film of acquired tastes, a pic that's hard to recommend with any great confidence. That is, though, unless you have a kink for violent black comedy crime movies, where the narrative drive is quirky and fulsome, even winsome in some regards.\r\n\r\nStory finds Lalita Panyopas (excellent) as Tum, a lady who has just been laid off from work courtesy of lots being drawn. Feeling desperate and at the end of her tether, she's amazed to find on her doorstep a noodle box with $25,000 in it. A gift from the gods? Not quite! And once some shifty gangster types come knocking at her door, nothing will ever be the same again...\r\n\r\nThere's a whole ream of films this draws from, but favourably so, especially since the films often referenced in reviews are pretty tasty in themselves. Yet this is no hack job, director and writer Pen-Ek Ratanaruang has crafted a splendid pot of Thai neo-noir curry, putting his own stamp on things, imbuing the pic with his own flourishes, such as showing acts of violence off screen! Via a shadow, a splatter of blood, or a pair of legs going limp.\r\n\r\nThe characters who inhabit this world are gloriously strange or purely deranged. The henchmen are from a Thai boxing club, garishly attired in bright red clobber (film is packed with pronounced reds), one of them is even deaf, while their boss is a bit off the map, likes to have one of his charges massage him with is feet. There's a phone sex pest, who ends up being a real key component to how things pan out, and one of the baddies reveals tears and a most bizarre death in the family!\r\n\r\nIt's all deliciously off kilter, even as the bodies pile up, the black comedy tongue is prodding away at the inside of the cheek. But ultimately its noir heart is with the vagary of fate and of the coincidences that pitch our everyday woman (she's no moll or assassin type) into a bloody and bonkers world. All of which has hinged, ironically, on a number badly screwed to an apartment door! 8/10"

The film now follows him as this rather unique journey introduces us to his community, and to his own interesting, complicated and lively backstory. I could run to all sorts of amateur psychology about my understanding of what each stop means to him; to those with whom he stops, and to those of us watching - for the adaptation of the pretty depressing Cheever short story would certainly indulge that; but I felt this was more of a testament to an always slightly under-rated actor in Lancaster. He starred in some superb films over his career, and this - with him almost entirely en cueros, with his soul likewise just as scantily attired, allows us to gradually understand where his character has been, and to guess, maybe, where he might be going. Kim Hunter maybe stands out amongst the supporting cast, but I'm not sure that any of them outdo the other - they all fulfil their function adequately offering us a myriad of possibilities for his current and past behaviour. The ending is especially poignant and as an ingenious and imaginative piece of cinema, this takes some beating."

I have lost track of many of them over the years. But no, apparently not. It was released in Canada by the crazy title A Garden of Cucumbers, which sounds less crazy when you know that was the title of the novel it is based on, which in turn is based on a bible quote.\r\n\r\nThis is a pleasant and lighthearted comedy, one you can watch both with both family and friends as the plot is simple enough so as not to require much concentration. There is also some romance baked into it, though it is not what we think of as rom-coms these days. So there you are.\r\n\r\nAnd I guess after you get past Van Dyke and Barbara Feldon, the excellent ensemble cast of character actors also contributed to  my wondering if Disney had made this film. Most movies don’t do this great a job choosing actors for the lesser roles.\r\n\r\nWe watched this as a holiday movie, though for 90% of the movie it doesn’t feel like one. But near the end they start mentioning Christmas and the climactic scenes take place at Gimbels on Christmas Eve. \r\n\r\nI can’t say I would seek out this movie to watch again, but it was amusing enough so that I wouldn’t root around for the controller if it came on while I was doing something else with the TV on. Sitting chatting with friends and family, for example."

Viveca Lindfors plays the Queen who also falls for his charms and he is given a job at court just in time to stave off the deadly ambitions of the King's minister, ably portrayed by Robert Douglas. This is another example of glorious Technicolour, but the writing and score are quite a bit inferior to Flynn's other historical tours-de-forces. There also appear to be quite a few scenes intercut from other films (\"Elizabeth and Essex\" being one) that do stand out a bit.

        "content": "Could you believe, they put a man on the Moon - that early!?\r\n\r\nDirected by Nathan Juran, First Men In The Moon is an adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel \"The First Men in the Moon\". Nigel Kneale (creator of Quatermass) and Jan Read write the screenplay, Ray Harryhausen provides the stop-motion effects, and the cast is made up of Lionel Jeffries, Edward Judd & Martha Hyer. \r\n\r\nThe story sees a UN rocket flight to the Moon land in 1964 thinking it is the first landing in history. However, they discover a British Union Flag and a notice written by a Katherine Callender (Hyer) stating that the Moon has already been claimed in the name of Queen Victoria. This starts off a search by the UN to locate Katherine so as to get to the bottom of the story. They soon find that she has passed away but locate her husband Arnold Bedford (Judd) in an old people's home. Arnold has over the years been dismissed as being \"not right\" for his claims of having once been to the Moon. But now the authorities are very keen to listen to what Arnold has to say. He tells a fantastical story of the time in 1899 when Professor Joseph Cavor (Jeffries), Katharine and himself, went to the Moon and met an alien race known as the Selenites.\r\n\r\nNathan Juran's movie opens with a booming piece of music by Laurie Johnson, the sort of score opening that promises either end of the world like dramatics, or something resembling the onset of War. We then open with astronauts on the Moon finding the Union Flag of Great Britain - the tone is set for some H. G. Wells sci-fi dalliances. Only what follows for the next 45 minutes is a sedate comedy like piece featuring three over the top Victorian caricatures. It's such as shame that the first two thirds of the movie is actually flat, given that the last third and the production in general really gathers pace and hits the spot. \r\n\r\nIt's a distracting contrast, and one that begs the question on who is responsible for this silly misstep?. Still, the bonkers plot is fine, even if it's some way away from Wells' social commentary tinged novel, while the actors, possibly in preparation for playing second fiddle to Harryhausen's work, just about keep it watchable till the pace and drama kicks in. As is the case with most Harryhausen led pictures, it's the appearance of his creations and his Dynnamation work that considerably lifts proceedings. Once our dynamic trio land on the Moon the theme considerably changes and we finally get the film that that opening hinted at. \r\n\r\nSelenite aliens (a kind of winged beetle race), a giant Caterpillar thingy and the Grand Lunar leader showcase some, what is admittedly, second tier Harryhausen work. However, it's enough to entertain with charm whilst giving the piece some dramatic thrust. Best of all, though, is the art work on show from John Blezard and his team, where terrific sets (and the ever gorgeous in her 40s, Martha Hyer) are enhanced by Wilkie Cooper's excellent colour photography (in LunarColor noless). One can't help thinking that the craft on show deserves a much better film than we, as a whole, get. So this is one for nostalgists like me, who as a youth looked forward to a Saturday afternoon viewing of something Harryhausen inspired, for completists of the great man's work and of course for lovers of \"B\" movie sci-fi schlock. 7/10"

She carefreely weeds out all the bad kids and anyone else who might get in the way.  \r\n\r\nThe production values of “Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers” (1988) are all-around superior to the original 1983 slasher. Sure, both are “Friday the 13th” knock-offs, but they’re distinguished by (1.) actual adolescents inhabiting the camp and (2.) the perverse uniqueness of the killer. \r\n\r\nThe only real campy element is Angela’s blithe chippy-ness in carrying out her slaughter spree. Other than that, this plays out like a mid-80’s coming-of-age drama with quality insights and surprisingly fleshed-out characters, which were the attributes of the first film as well. For instance, Molly (Renée Estevez) is very distinguished from Ally (Valerie Hartman) and Mare (Susan Marie Snyder). The mullets and short shorts on guys are amusing.\r\n\r\nAn additional highlight is the kick-axx soundtrack of semi-obscure mid-80’s rock/metal, starting with Anvil’s excellent “Straight Between the Eyes” during the opening credits (only hindered by the juvenile and tasteless lyrics, but what else is new?). “Outta Control” by John Altyn is featured later and Obsession’s “Desperate to Survive” during the end credits. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 20 minutes, and was shot in Bremen, Georgia, about an hour’s drive west of Atlanta.   \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

It stars Christopher Plummer, James Mason, David Hemmings, Susan Clark, Frank Finlay, Anthony Quayle, Donald Sutherland, Geneviève Bujold & John Gielgud.\r\n\r\nFilm pitches Sherlock Holmes (Plummer) and Dr. Watson (Mason) into the hunt for Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel, London 1888...\r\n\r\nI've been exploited old fellow, by the very people for whom we are searching.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of detectives searching for Britain's most notorious serial killer, it's a killer pitch that had already had a film made in 1965 called A Study in Terror. That was a film that couldn't quite get it right, here, 14 years later, there's a bigger budget and \"A\" list gloss to help tell the tale. And boy does it work! In the cannon of Sherlock Holmes, Murder by Decree is to Holmes films what On Her Majesty's Secret Service is to the James Bond franchise. Appertaining to the great detective himself, it's the odd one out, a divisive picture, not because it's rubbish or technically shy, but because the main man protagonist dares to be human, a man of conscious; politically, socially and ethically. He's still the same charming, clever and complex character most have come to know and love, but Murder by Decree fronts him out as a human being, with Watson alongside him as a non buffoon bloke doing his bit for the case whilst remaining sensitive about the last pea on his plate! It's these characterisations, splendidly played by two actors of considerable talent, that are at the core of the film's success.\r\n\r\nIf she dies and you come under my hand? Expect no mercy.\r\n\r\nPeriod production value is high, it has to be for a Jolly Jack based movie. Bring the dark, bring the smog and bring the Victorian costumes (Judy Moorcroft). Then play it out amongst shadowy lamp lighted cobbled streets and let the sets drip with slum London sweat and tears. All that is required then is to have a source story of compelling interest, of which Murder by Decree scores greatly as well. It's fanciful for sure, but the most spectacular of all Ripper theories. From a secret love child to the Freemasons, and up to Royalty itself, it's a potent notion put forward. That is of course conjecture as a solution, but the makers are to be applauded for taking that idea and successfully combining the Arthur Conan Doyle creations with historical reality, something that A Study in Terror fell considerably short on.\r\n\r\nRest of the cast is filled out with some quality as well, where Hemmings, Quayle, Finlay, Gielgud and Bujold don't disappoint, the latter of which gets to really perform with substance in the pivotal scene set in an Asylum. Only real let down is Sutherland, or more like what the makers did (didn't do) with him. His psychic Robert Lees crops up for a couple of small scenes for what we expect will be a telling contribution to the plot, but they aren't. It seems like just an excuse to do Sutherland up like he had just awoken from the grave, and to give the picture some ethereal sheen moments. For the finale and the big reveal of the Ripper, Plummer is simply magnificent. He holds court in front of his peers, including the Prime Minister (Gielgud), and unfurls the explanation with impassioned fortitude, it's then that we realise this was always a Sherlock Holmes movie, and not a Jack the Ripper piece. With that, it's one of the best featuring the Deer Stalker wearing fellow. 9/10"

Here, together with stalwart colleague \"Dr. Watson\" (James Mason) they find themselves drawn into the mysterious investigation of a series of gruesome Whitechapel murders. What is being locally described as the \"Jack the Ripper\" crimes is baffling \"Lestrade\" (Frank Finlay) to the point that his job is on the line after an intervention by the Commissioner himself (Sir Anthony Quayle). This adaptation follows the increasingly more established story of political and court intrigues around the identity of and the reasons for the \"Ripper\". A solid cast lend well to the overall sense of despair and, to some extent, depravity in which these prostitutes lived - with a good effort from both Susan Clark (\"Mary\") and Genevieve Bujold (\"Annie\"); the latter offering a particularly poignant scene towards the end. The denouement drags out rather, and perhaps shows up a little of the limitations of Plummer, but otherwise this is an entertaining enough retelling of a story that benefits from great attention to detail and an effective score. Rathbone and Bruce they are not, but Plummer and Mason make a good fist of this, and it's an easy watch."

It opens at night, in the neon lit, Los Angeles jungle shimmering with welcoming Hollywood haunts like Miceli’s, Firefly and Musso and Frank and ends within the blinding white snow of the more foreboding Wyoming Wilderness. It pits an older doctor and his much younger, artist friend against two thugs, one an over-eager, violence-lusting psychopath and the other a casual, smarter killer whose relaxed approach borders on the likable. It features a chic fashion show with a modern looking Anne Bancroft as a “mannequin” followed by a cuddly rural bus ride during which the lovers express their romantic feelings after waking up to (decidedly non chic) whiskers. There’s cruel violence committed against good Samaritans mixed with quippy one liners and a surprising amount of dark humor. And did I mention Anne Bancroft falls in love with Aldo Ray? They seem mismatched, but then, perfect together—and their moments are exceptionally romantic. In short, Nightfall is a trip. But a great trip, and a noteworthy addition to noir innovator Jacques Tourneur’s oeuvre (which includes, among other splendid pictures, the horror/noir classics Cat People and I Walked With a Zombie and his key noir, Out of the Past). \r\n\r\nAdapted by Stirling Silliphant from hard boiled writer David Goodis's 1947 novel and brilliantly shot by Burnett Guffey (who also shot Nicholas Ray’s masterpiece In a Lonely Place and Arthur Penn’s ingenious Bonnie and Clyde),the picture is considered by some, a minor film noir, something that’s always baffled me. Made in the later cycle of the genre (released in 1957), the picture skillfully weaves a convoluted story, harsh violence, existential angst, naturalistic acting and sweet romanticism without ever feeling forced. And as stated earlier—it’s very funny—something Tourneur always intended. And though the theme song seems a bit overheated (Al Hibbler crooning “Nightfall…and you!”—a tune that really ought to grace a Ross Hunter production) even that works when looking at the film in its entirety. Akin to the startling laughs spiking the movie, it echoes Tourneur’s own sly sense of humor. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story is structured much like Out of the Past, with our hero (who's not guilty, unlike Mitchum), Rayburn Vanning (Ray) relating his complicated story to a woman. Only in this instance, the lovely lady, Marie Gardner (Bancroft), is a bit confused. Pulling a damsel in distress act for the benefit of two thugs waiting to jump Ray (she thought they were police officers after a wanted man), she sets up the poor lug. Vanning is then accosted by Red (Rudy Bond) and John  (Brian Keith) and taken to a deserted oil derrick (an unsettling yet weirdly amusing scene) where he’s set to be tortured. They want to know where that money’s hidden, something Vanning continually states he doesn’t know. Vanning escapes, finds his way to Marie’s apartment and gives her the skinny. Or rather, the thick skinny. He explains the convoluted predicament that’s left him understandably paranoid. While on a pleasant camping trip in Jackson Hole, Wyoming with best friend Dr. Edward Gurston (Frank Albertson) in which the two men will hunt, and in a more uncomfortable moment, near the sticky subject of Doc’s much younger wife (whom we learn later has a thing for Vanning and sent him letters saying so). The conversation is cut short when a car crashes off an embankment and two shady characters (Red and John), emerge. Doc fixes John’s arm but they soon realize they're unlucky witnesses (the men just robbed a bank). Almost shockingly, Doc is shot dead and Vanning is left injured. The crooks blaze off, only, they make an enormous mistake—they grab the doctor’s bag instead of their own bag of money. Vanning is able to rise from his injury, hide the dough and take off. Moving from town to town under suspicion that he killed Doc, Vanning ends up in Los Angeles, where he’s being tailed by insurance investigator Ben Fraser (James Gregory) who confesses to his wife that Vanning just doesn’t seem the type. \r\n\r\nAnd as played by Aldo Ray—he doesn’t seem the type. One of the more striking aspects to Nightfall is its casting, and the barrel-chested, thick necked Ray, who was a natural born actor (watch his first and largely unschooled leading role in George Cukor’s The Marrying Kind and you’ll see how immediately gifted the man was. Also in Anthony Mann’s brilliant Men in War). Ray is the perfect good guy in-over-his- head. With his raspy voice, yet boyish appeal (he looked like he literally walked off a football field, which is why Cukor made him take ballet before The Marrying Kind) Ray always exuded a different kind of mystery than say, Mitchum or Ryan or Widmark—men who rarely appeared “normal.” Ray, an ex Frogman who fought in Iwo Jima, was a brawny man’s man certainly, but he always looked to be hiding a secret. That inside he had the soul of a poet or artist—a man of depth beyond his tough exterior. And so, appropriately, in Nightfall, he’s an artist. \r\n\r\nBrian Keith is another standout and like Ray, an actor I always wished was my father (and not merely for the TV show Family Affair). He’s so agreeable here—and his delivery manages to be both distracted and pithy rather than rat-a-tat. When he humorously claims that Red’s homicidal kicks stem from his lack of childhood play (“When Red was a kid they didn’t have enough playgrounds. He’s sort of an adult delinquent.”) he’s both revelatory and teasing. And his banter towards Red is cleverly berating: “The top of your head never closed up when you were a kid. Neither did your mouth.” Cracking wise with Red, the two spar like men who are ready to kill each other, but also who are simply getting on each other’s nerves (preceding some of Tarantino’s talky criminals). But talking aside, deadlier fates await them including a fatal gunshot and death by snowplow. \r\n \r\nAnd wild, almost ridiculous fate was something Tourneur excelled at, not surprisingly. Based on the bizarre treatment at the hands of his filmmaker father, Tourneur developed a dark sense of the absurd. As written in John Wakemen’s “World Film Directors Vol. 1 1890-1946,”Tourneur believed that the childhood he endured—one of “grotesque punishment” lied at the root of his cinematic obsessions. Relating that he was sent to a poor school and teased unmercifully for his square suspenders, Tourneur claimed: “I think this is what prompted me to introduce comic touches into the dramatic moments of my films…Mixing fear and the ridiculous can be very exciting.” \r\n\r\nIndeed. As Red can’t wait to torture a terrified Vanning, he sinisterly and bizarrely sings: “The tougher they are the more fun they are tra-la.”"

It's not bad, just lagging in places, and seems a tad too close to Stephen King's 'The Tommyknockers' later on, for comfort (though that could be due to the novel it's from 'The Gods Hate Kansas' rather than the film).\r\n\r\nThe apparently high degree of sexual attraction the two hot ladies in the film have for the protagonist, Dr. Curtis Temple, is hard to believe--unless they simply went for his bankroll or had 'daddy' issues. Although Robert Hutton, who plays him, was only 47 at the time of filming, and the actresses who portrayed his assistant Lee Mason and the girl attendant at the gas station were 36 and of unknown age respectively, he looks at least 55 and that he could be the Mason's father and perhaps the attendant's grandfather. Bad casting in that regard, although they're more than capable for the modest complexity of their parts.\r\n\r\nI liked the fact that unlike most other science fiction films, the potential of working together with the invasion force as a possible alternative to the tired, seemingly inevitable probability of war with the invading force was explored. Science fiction and horror are extremely popular filmmaking genres that have stood the test of time because they offer us clever avenues as metaphors for examining closely issues that affect society today. The time has certainly come in which people have to stop and intelligently discuss topics that concern us, rather than cling doggedly to our dogma, and to Hell with anyone that dares think any differently than we do. Frankly I feel that it's the only hope that we as a civilization have."

There is little jeopardy here - we know from the start what is actually going on and so we are really only following the footsteps of the inquisitive scientist as he follows the scent - all the way to the moon and a shaggy haired Michael Gough in a shiny cape. It has clearly been done with very little budget, and although some effort is made to film outdoors, most of this is stage-bound and reminded me of one of the Peter Cushing \"Dr. Who\" films from earlier in the 1960s. Aside from some torches tarted up to look like ray guns, and a cleverly converted colander used to deflect mind-bending rays, there are no special effects to speak of and after about an hour of this, I was really quite bored. There were plenty of cheap and cheerful sci-films coming out of Hollywood at the time and this is certainly no worse, but as an action or adventure film it falls woefully short."

The previous six are: “Horror of Dracula” (1958), “Dracula, Prince of Darkness” (1966), “Dracula has Risen from the Grave” (1968), “Taste the Blood of Dracula” (1970), “Scars of Dracula” (1970) and “Dracula A.D. 1972” (1972).\r\n\r\nWhile this is arguably the least in the series, it has a lot to offer once you get past Dracula’s henchmen riding motorcycles and wearing brown vests with wool fringe (no doubt this was ‘hip’ attire back in 1972 when the film was shot). It helps to grasp that Stoker’s original novel took place in what was then modern times, 1897, with Dracula being over 400 years old by that point. \r\n\r\n“Satanic Rites” simply envisions how the vampire lord would function in the early 70s. In Stoker’s book he’s a powerful and arrogant creature that holds a position of authority, a Count, and prefers to dwell in an intimidating castle in Transylvania or a gothic estate in London, not to mention acquires subjects to serve his purposes, like gypsies and Renfield. Here Drac’s DD Denham persona is the modern English equivalent to a Count in Transylvania hundreds of years prior. In both cases he’s an untouchable authority figure with minions carrying out his will. Simply put, this is how a 500 year-old evil being would operate in the 1970s using elements of the modern world to accomplish his ends, including the British Empire.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, in Stoker’s novel Dracula recognized the British Empire as a means to spread his cult of vampirism around the world and eventually take it over. He wasn’t content to just threaten a few local nobodies as observed in the five previous sequels. In “Satanic Rites” he’s back to his vision of global domination, tricking 4 members of the Establishment into being agents of his \"own created Apocalypse,\" but now we see the incredibly sinister culmination of his power-mad scheme.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate what this flick has to offer you have to get past the motorcycle-riding henchmen and their dubious vests. Once you do, it has quite a bit to offer: The notable group of protagonists, including those played by Michael Coles and Joanna Lumley; the way they put their heads together to figure out what the Count is doing and how to stop him; and Drac’s “harem” he keeps in the basement (played by Maggie Fitzgerald, Finnuala O'Shannon, Pauline Peart and a newly converted vamp played by Valerie Van Ost).  \r\n    \r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 27 minutes and was shot in Hertfordshire & nearby London, England.    \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

The investigation centres around a manor house where the great and the good of London society meet, ostensibly for ordinary gatherings, but we know it is much more sinister (well, in theory, anyway). What's more - this house is built upon an old cemetery, and guess who was buried in it just a few years earlier? This is a sort of 1970s \"Freemasons meet Dracula\" affair, with a lacklustre dialogue and some pretty lame performances all round. It builds predictably to a conflagration that seems a long time coming, and neither Cushing nor the fleeting appearances from Christopher Lee really ignite the film. The score has that early synthesised sound to it, and the photography - though probably quite effective in 1973, now looks dated and juddery. These Hammer films were well past their sell-by dates by now, the gift had long since stopped giving and perhaps because it is in colour, it is not remotely scary. Passable, but only because I like the genre."

Yet that forms only a brief few minutes of quite ample film. Two decades on, audiences of today ought to look past the sensation and appreciate the film for what it really has to offer: a convincing contemporary take on Hermann Meville's psychological novel PIERRE, and the way Carax interweaves Melville's structure of 19th-century wealthy elites with harrowing references to contemporary France, Bosnia and the plight of Balkan refugees.\r\n\r\nThe son of a deceased diplomat of some note, Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu) lives in splendor in rural France, in a manor house with his widowed mother (Catherine Deneuve). Things are going well for young Pierre: a novel he has written has become a bestseller and he is engaged to the lovely Lucie (Delphine Chuillot). But then he encounters a mysterious woman named Isabelle (Yekaterina Golubeva) who tells him in broken French that she is his half-sister, born to Pierre's diplomat father and an unknown Balkan woman. Isabelle is in fact less a character and more a spectral presence that haunts Pierre's life. Intrigued by this otherworldly creature, Pierre gives up his privileged existence and enters into a vividly depicted bohemianism that brings about his physical and mental decline.\r\n\r\nPOLA X prefers to tell its story more through visceral images than dialogue. In fact, the dialogue is deliberately stilted, allowing the film to dip in and out of its basis in Melville’s 19th-century novel. So much of the story of Pierre's decline is told through the bucolic idyll of the first half of the film and the brutal squalor he later chooses. This imagery is so strong that even if POLA X feels somewhat too tentative about itself to rank as one of the all-time greatest films, it has haunted this viewer's thoughts since watching it.\r\n\r\nAnother nice touch of POLA X is the close way in which Carax worked with the composer of the film's score Scott Walker, who was then fresh from his acclaimed album TILT. When Pierre leaves home after meeting Isabelle, he enters into a bizarre community of artists in an industrial setting, who seem to be hiding sinister plans behind their avant-garde work. It is here that Walker's score goes from the subdued strings of the first half of the film into brasher, more aggressive sounds. Carax has set things up so this music is both diegetic and non-diegetic, part of the outside narration of Pierre's psychological decline and contemporary political strife as much as the film's action itself."

No? Then go watch the damn movie! It's very fucking good. The opening is almost as strong as the original, and pretty much everything else about it is better. Not to mention the fact that I'm a total Luke Goss fanboy. All of the characters are so much better. They interact and everything. And even though Wesley Snipes has never really impressed me as an actor, the character of Blade was a little less cheesy, which always helps, and basically just better all 'round.\r\n\r\nSPOILERS FOR BLADE, BLADE II and TRINITY: An interesting point, without ruining anything about the trilogy is that in all three films, vampires fight vampires. Not in the whole \"Blade's half a vampire so he kills full-on vampires\" way, although there is most certainly that, but in Blade, Frost kills the Elder vampires to become La Magra. In Blade II, The Blood Pack and Blade team up to take down a new, much more dangerous breed of vampires. And in Trinity, Dracula goes around killing vampires, pretty much for fun. Just food for thought. I've never read the comics much myself, so I don't really know if that's something that's been going on for a while, or if it just turned out that way.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of lame bits. Some very stupid lines like \"they took all of our weapons. Even your sword.\" Even your sword! Man, the single weapon for which you were named after that has killed more vampires than any other thing on the planet, and the vampires took it away from you? The audacity! And there's this whole thing where Whistler is alive again, they went most of the way to explaining it, and then sort of forgot. It would have been so simple to have a four second flashback cover the lot of it. Oh well.\r\n\r\nStill though, I'm very, very fond of this one.\r\n\r\n77%\r\n\r\n-Gimly"

It's one of the best vampire films of the last 20 years.**\r\n\r\nBlade II was a significant step up for the Blade franchise (and, unfortunately, the trilogy's peak) with a much more experienced director and a unique and exciting premise. This time the vampires are the prey and are desperate to survive the growing horde of vampire zombies, desperate enough to side with their sworn enemy, Blade, in hopes of surviving this plague. Both Blade and Blade: Trinity placed inexperienced directors at the helm, but Blade II put experienced horror and creature director Guillermo del Toro in charge, and the result was outstanding! Blade II has the most horror influence of the trilogy and the best story. Del Toro's involvement in all three films might have saved the series, but instead, we got the all-out action letdown of Blade: Trinity. Wesley Snipes was a perfect choice for Blade, and surrounding him with a cast that included Ron Pearlman, Tony Curran, and Donnie Yen (all experienced in the genre and with action) makes Blade II a top-notch vampire action comic book film."

He allies with the \"Bloodpack\" and with \"Scud\" (Norman Reedus) on a quest to track down Luke Goss \"(Nomak\") who is the one creating these hybrid monsters, and to stop them before extinction beckons. This has quite a strong storyline, the characters are given some time to evolve and the chemistry between the rather static Snipes and Kris Kristofferson (\"Whistler\") works well on the few occasions it is on screen - though not really well enough to compensate for pretty wooden performances from messrs. Goss and Reedus. As with the first film, the fight scenes are far too heavily staged; they rob the story of menace and the over-use of the soundtrack to accompany these extended, gory, slaughter-scenes really does reduce this to an almost cartoon status. It is good to look at, stylishly produced, but sadly nowhere near as good as the original."

Nope, the Queen is not making another state visit - it's \"Rocco\" (Fred Ward) and it looks like he wants to save Chris Rock any future embarrassment by blowing up the Oscars ceremony. What now ensues is a by now routine sequence of frying pan to fire scenarios, straight out of a Laurel & Hardy film. Sadly, that humour is all a bit passé now and though an appearance by Anna Nicole Smith must have given every budding actress from Tallahassee to Timbuktu a sense of hope that if she can make it, they can - the rest of it falls pretty flat! It is well enough made, the quips are quickly delivered and some of them still raise the odd smile. In the main, though, it is 80 minutes that almost looks like out-takes from the first two films with a thinly constructed plot by way of a template to hold it all together. It is watchable, but just not a patch on the earlier iterations."

Leslie Nielsen plays the principal of the school and father of the girl who died.\r\n\r\n“Prom Night” (1980) combines elements of “Carrie” (1976), “Halloween” (1978) and “Saturday Night Fever” (1977). It contains the prom set-up & conniving students of the first one, the slasher killer & Jamie Lee Curtis of the second and the disco dancing of the third. The emphasis of a group of teens in high school is reminiscent of the later “Christine” (1983). The movie debuted 2.5 months after “Friday the 13th” and less than 21 months after “Halloween.” \r\n\r\nWhile it’s the least of these as far as polished filmmaking goes, it’s not far off and scores better on the female front than all of them except “Friday the 13th.” It’s basically a coming-of-age flick focusing on high school in the Great Lakes region with the threat of a masked assailant. There are no less than four possible suspects and I was unable to guess the slayer.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in the Toronto area (Richmond Hill, St. James Cemetery, Scarborough Bluffs and Don Mills Collegiate Institute).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

A diabolical organization has taken the scientist captive with intent to use his weapon for world domination. Karl Malden plays the leader of BIG O.\r\n\r\n\"Murderer’s Row” (1966) was the second of four Matt Helm movies released in three years from winter, 1966, to winter, 1969. The franchise was obviously inspired by the great success of the first four James Bond flicks from 1962-1965. Unlike the books (and Bond), the tone is lighthearted and spoofy with Martin doing his wink-at-the-camera act, similar to the contemporaneous Derek Flint flicks with James Coburn, not to mention Raquel Welch’s “Fathom” (1967).\r\n\r\nThe tagline for the first film in the Helm series, “The Silencers,” was “guns, gadgets, girls,” but a more accurate description would be “guns, gadgets, girls and booze.” Naturally these are worthwhile flicks to experience the fun, colorful side of the 60s, but since the spy exploits are played as a low-key joke, there’s no sense of danger and, worse, the story simply isn’t compelling, at least in “Murderer’s Row.”\r\n\r\nYeah, there are several attractive females on hand with Ann-Margret being the most charismatic and alluring, but they’re all so thin and unshapely they’re kinda meh. Don’t get me wrong, Ann is a top-of-the-line beauty, as witnessed in Elvis’ “Viva Las Vegas” (1964), but she obviously lost weight in the two years leading up to this flick. It’s a shame because she lost her shapely appeal. However, if you prefer women with stick figures, you won’t have a problem.\r\n\r\nThese fun 007-imitation flicks from the 60s all came & went and are forgotten, while the James Bond franchise marches on decade after decade. There’s a reason for this. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 45 minutes. While second unit teams shot sequences in Villefranche-sur-Mer (France), Monte Carlo (Monaco) and the Isle of Wight for the hovercraft and helicopter scenes (England), Martin refused to go to Europe so all of his scenes were done in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"

No? That figures. The script's interesting, but it's not terribly sense-making. What I mean to say, is, the script's rubbish, but the *story* is great. The whole film is really rather story and effects driven, but the characters are pretty lacking. Quinn is sort of fun, and Deacon's... well... he's attractive, but not a lot else. Still, there's more to him than most of the characters, including the titular Blade.\r\n\r\nStraight up, just putting out there, I think goth-culture is attractive, so, my aesthetics may go quite a way to influencing my decision in the final score, if you disagree with me, you might want to keep that in mind, seeing as most vampires have at least a little bit of that going on. All that aside though, the opening of Blade is one of the strongest ways a film can start off that I've ever seen. It has basically everything you could want for a modern vampire tale. Including the Blood Rave song, Confusion (Pump Panel Remix) by New Order.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was another cool point, lots of ins and outs in a non-nauseating way. Although the fight choreography suffered from a serious case of \"Only-One-Guy-Attacks-At- A-Time\" Syndrome. Come on guys, this ain't Tekken. When there's an army to fight, fight an army. Maybe not all at once, I know that could get a tad pointless, but it really didn't transfer well in this film.\r\n\r\nTo end with, there's one plot-hole I'd like to bring up, I don't think I'll be spoiling anything too badly, but if you want to go in completely fresh, stop reading. There's one point when Frost says he needs to kill the 12 Elder vamps in a big underground ritual in order to complete his ascendancy into the Blood God (Khorne?), but he kills the leader earlier, on a beach. Okay, so maybe he wasn't counted, and he was actually number 13. But, Frost's lady-friend Mercury kills another with Blade's sword, before the ritual gets started, and nobody seems to care... I am dubious- faced.\r\n\r\nAfter all that though, Blade is a vampire film that's not slow like Nosferatu, and not indescribably awful like Twilight, so for people with tastes like mine, it's certainly worth a geez.\r\n\r\n66%\r\n\r\n-Gimly"

Cox is not really a very versatile actor, but here he provides a solid fulcrum for a story that has plenty of action. There is much less emphasis on the moralising, hormonal, frat-style storyline of the 2000 version; the characters are older and better developed and can control, therefore use, their powers to more dramatic effect for those watching. The story is still a bit thinly predictable, but the visual effects team pull out all the stops keeping this 2¼ marathon moving along surprisingly effortlessly.

The struggle between light and dark, both in humanity and mutants, was a theme throughout and highlighted in a multitude of ways. Exploring Wolverine's mysterious past and tying it into the overall conflict of the X-Men was a wise choice rather than having Logan search for answers alone. In addition, the women of the X-Men, Jean Grey and Storm, along with Mystique, saw more significant roles and character development. X2 was the Empire Strikes Back of the original X-Men trilogy- better in every way, with exciting new characters, threats, stories, and effects. X2 deserves a place as one of the greatest comic book movies and sequels of all time."

Schroeder just turns the camera on and lets Amin dictate the itinerary. In addition to endless parades involving his obviously strapped-for-resources military (one sequence finds paratroopers training with a metal playground slide while onlookers laugh uproariously), we also catch the dictator trying to (literally) talk to the animals; exhorting his government ministers to be more masculine; lecturing the hospitals' doctors on the importance of not being drunk; informing the male leader of Tanzania that he would happily marry him if his hair wasn't gray and he had the right parts; and referencing his sexual marksmanship as it applies to the gender of his children. All of this would be easy enough to laugh off if he didn't also engage in off-the-cuff anti-semitism; order public executions of dissidents; post letters to the United Nations saying that Hitler didn't go far enough; and ultimately lead an estimated 300,000 Ugandans to their death. Amin presents himself as the jolly manifestation of evil; an affable megalomaniac who jostled his way onto the world stage and left his nation in blood-soaked tatters."

See rant below:\r\n\r\nNot only is the Phoenix storyline butchered, but the script rewrites the personalities of its key characters. Since when were Cyclops, Xavier, and Magneto such assholes? Halle Berry's demand for more screentime basically means she shows up in more scenes. Her character has no arc and often says lines that contradict what she said in previous scenes. Rogue has also turned into a whiny sidenote, part of a shoehorned in love triangle, which is disappointing given that the trilogy started from her perspective.\r\n\r\nThrowing in as many mutants as you can on the screen, some with powers that would be good if this were an X-Men spoof, but here it's played for absolute seriousness. It also means every character is essentially one note because there's no time to develop anyone. It certainly doesn't help that the movie carelessly removes or kills off half the team from the previous two films. Instead of shocking me, I'm sitting there never sure who I should be rooting for (except for Wolverine).\r\n\r\nX3 hurtles through scene after scene to get from one action set piece to another, and at just 93 minutes, there's never any time to process the plot. Of course the movie has to sequel bait with a final scene that suggests everyone will eventually get their powers back. What a way to render the entire movie pointless.\r\n\r\nLastly, this movie cost $215 million to make. Only about a quarter of that money shows up on the screen. The CGI, green screen, and makeup effects are obvious and look horrible. So the movie looks like crap, tells it's story like crap, and treats it's characters like crap. X3 is crap."

        "content": "***A good finale to the original trilogy***  \r\n\r\nI think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.\r\n\r\nThe unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant \"X\" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a \"Brotherhood of Mutants\" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\r\n\r\nYou could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.\r\n\r\nAlthough everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - \"X-Men\" (2000), \"X2: X-Men United\" (2003) and \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" (2006).\r\n\r\n\"X-Men: The Last Stand\" is generally well-regarded but has a very vocal segment of fans who revile it. This makes little sense since, despite having a new director, the film has the same tone and principle actors as the previous two and brings to culmination the ideas presented therein. Aside from the final fight between Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's X-Men we get the resurrection of Jean Grey and her struggle with the dark side of her psyche.\r\n\r\nSome complain of the deaths of two prominent characters, but how often are characters resurrected in comics? Isn't one significant character resurrected in this very film? Others complain about the supposed short runtime and lack of depth but X3 has the exact same runtime as the first film (104 minutes) and there's plenty of depth to mine, take Rogue's dilemma over taking a cure in order to have human intimacy, Phoenix's incredible inner conflict symbolizing the universal clash of flesh and spirit (id and super-ego), Cyclop's grief and astonishing discovery, Pyro's moral degeneration, Mystique's plight after getting kicked out of the Brotherhood and Wolverine's struggle to do the right thing despite his deep love, to name just six.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, the big clash on Alcatraz Island feels routine and dull. They should’ve kept the focus on the Dark Phoenix, but the producers probably felt this would take away from the other characters, plus they wanted the clichéd big battle sequence. Nevertheless, there’s enough good here to appreciate.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"

Taking a quick look at some other reviews and it seems to main gripe is how it treats certain characters from the comics, which is fair enough for sure but that doesn't come into play for me as I'm not a comic reader.\r\n\r\nI can only judge it as a film and as one I found it suitably entertaining. Hugh Jackman remains the top dog, though at the beginning the way Wolverine acts felt off to me - though that quickly went away. I would've liked if they found a spot for Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), though one of his replacements in Beast (Kelsey Grammer) went down well with me.\r\n\r\nFrom what I read I can understand other people's complaints with this, especially with the aforementioned iffy character treatment, but I gotta be honest and say that I found it to be a good enough watch - even if it is comparatively the weakest entry of the original trilogy.\r\n\r\n/copied directly from my Letterboxd review\\"

This time \"Magneto\" (Sir Ian McKellen) is outraged when the human government develops a top secret cure for mutants. On the face of it, this is going to lead to another simple battle royal between the forces of our man-metal and his eternal nemesis \"Xavier\" (Patrick Stewart) and his army of fair-minded supporters led by \"Wolverine\" (Hugh Jackman). Thing is, though, \"Magneto\" has an ace up his sleeve in the form of the \"Dark Phoenix\" that has turned \"Jean Gray\" (Famke Janssen) into something more lethal than anyone can imagine. Can she be stopped, persuaded, destroyed? It's really a bit of same old, same old, this - great visual effects, loads of pyrotechnics and a good old dose of good versus evil, but the story is actually pretty weak and the dialogue seems to regurgitate much of that from the first film. Jackman really tries to inject a sense of thrill into this, and there's no denying that Ben Foster looks particularly hot with his angelic wings, but otherwise it might as well be another episode in a Marvel mini-series that you just know will deliver nothing more at the end than an opportunity for a sequel. It is a good looking film, but the two leads are overly hammy, and Kelsey Grammer isn't the only one to feel a bit blue at the seriously over-orchestrated denouement."

Kim Basinger plays Largo’s girlfriend while Bernie Casey is a highlight as Agent Leiter.    \r\n\r\nDespite the return of Connery, \"Never Say Never Again\" (1983) is an ‘unofficial’ James Bond film in that it wasn’t produced by Eon. As such, the recognizable Bond theme is missing, as is the opening gun barrel sequence and the familiar MI6 office cast. Other than these factors, it’s a 007 film through and through. While it made a respectable profit at the box office, it didn’t do as well as “Octopussy” with Roger Moore, released four months earlier.\r\n\r\nIt’s a competent enough James Bond film it just pales in comparison to the dynamic “Octopussy,” which is arguably the most adventuresome, action-packed 007 flick. While Connery was three years younger than Moore, he looked older. It's also not as good as the movie it remakes, \"Thunderball\" (1965). Speaking of which, why try to remake such a great Bond flick anyway? Connery already did this story 18 years earlier and very effectively; producers should've given him an entirely new tale for his final stab at 007.\r\n\r\nSome of the highlights include a knock-down-drag-out scrap between Bond and a big lug at the clinic; a clash with a couple of sharks in the waters of the Bahamas; a wild motorcycle/car chase in Nice, France; an escape from an old fortress in North Africa; and an exciting shootout at an archeological site.\r\n\r\nSuper-sharp Barbara Carrera stands out on the feminine front while Basinger is winsome enough, but she never interested me. Prunella Gee is striking as Patricia, a professional at the English clinic. Saskia Cohen Tanugi plays an MI6 agent, Nicole, while Lucy Hornak has a small role as a cute nurse.   \r\n  \r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 14 minutes, and was shot in England; Nassau, Bahamas; the French Riviera; Almería, Andalucía, Spain; Malta; and Silver Springs, Florida.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

However, I have challenged myself to watch the entire filmography of Kenneth Branagh, so **THE MAGIC FLUTE** is not to be ignored.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I must apologize to the massively popular opera's fans who will see my approach devoid of knowledge of any production.\r\n\r\nThis film version takes place during the first world war, in a non-descript country.  It follows a young soldier sent on a mission to save the Queen of the Night's daughter, Pamina.  The story reveals through magic that the kidnapper may not be evil after all.\r\n\r\nI imagine this story, set to match Mozart's original story idea, may be more palatable and light. Especially the importance of miracles in a story named after a magical flute.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom's brilliant treasure, Stephen Fry, adapted this story into one that could be relatable to England during World War I. Branagh, who directed Fry in **PETER'S FRIENDS**, helms this beautifully designed film.  the production and flow of the story show why Branagh is such a fascinating director.  \r\n\r\nBeing unfamiliar of any specific artist recording of anything from the Opera stage, I cannot comment in good faith to the power of any specific performance.  But it seems to sound good to me.  But lacking Patrick Doyle, it may seem less _Branagh_.\r\n\r\nThis film took years to make it to the United States in any form until it eventually appeared on DVD.  Maybe it's just the obvious.  Its not as important a piece stateside.\r\n\r\nI'm glad to have seen it, but will likely avoid a re-watch for a handful of years."

The humour is dark, subtle and personable, as are the efforts from Jack Warner (\"Nightingale\") and it is set in a wonderfully gritty post war, bombed-out London full of craters and ruins in which to set the increasingly enjoyable scenario. The youngsters gel well together too, a team effort with the odd red herring and plenty of fisticuffs that compensate for the nor terribly high production standards (especially the tinny audio). Remembering the environment in which it was made, it's a remarkably enjoyable and light-hearted indication that war was over and that the sunlit uplands were again on the horizon. Good fun."

Even though she loves him more than anything that doesn't take away her sexual desires for other men. The husband can't stand not being the only one but perhaps after time he'll learn that \"all ladies do it\". This is only my second film from Brass and his visual style is certainly on full display here even though his story telling skills aren't the greatest. I was shocked at how well the screenplay actually was because a lot of softcore efforts place the story second behind the sex but that really wasn't the case here. The message of a woman having the right to be \"sexual\" without being labeled \"sluts\" was taken very serious by the film. Brass does a very good job with the look of the film with some great cinematography and some wonderful set designs. The biggest issue I had with his direction is that the entire film comes off as a butt fetish video as Brass is constantly zooming in on women's behinds. I like a good butt as much as the next person but after a while it grows quite tiresome but the scene where the women decide to go skinny dipping is priceless. The performances aren't really anything special but they do the job and in the end God knows there's a lot worse out there than this."

To live it is very hard.\r\n\r\nAs the war rages between the American settlers and the Apache, former soldier Tom Jeffords happens upon a young Indian wounded after an attack. Taking upon himself to aid the boy, it's not long before the Apache show up intent on killing Jeffords by way of the war instincts. Pleading for Jeffords' life, the boy manages to get him spared by the Apache chief, Cochise. It's the start of a friendship that may just bring and end to the war and peace across the west.\r\n\r\nTho not the first \"social\" Western film made, Broken Arrow, it can be argued, is maybe one of the most important and telling genre films of the 50s. Showing humanist portrayals of the Apache and dealing out level headed tellings of the relationships between whites and the Native Americans, Delmer Daves' film is as relevant today as it was back on release. Adapted from Elliott Arnold's novel Blood Brother, the story follows Jeffords (a measured and fine James Stewart) as he attempts to broker peace between the warring factions. Firstly by convincing Cochise (Jeff Chandler bang on form) to allow the mail run thru the pass, something that brings suspicion and calls of Indian lover from Jeffords' own kind, and then to finally set up a peace pact at a time when violence and hatred was rife in the west.\r\n\r\nAs the friendship between the two men grows, Jeffords and an Apache girl fall in love (beautiful Debra Paget as Sonseeahray), thus giving the story a further jolt of momentum. The screenplay then really hits its stride, as Daves and his crew pit peace and inter racial love against a backdrop of bloodshed and savagery. Never glossing over just how hard peace is going to be, Broken Arrow retains intelligence and a sensitivity even as breakaway factions from both sides (for example we see Geronimo split the Apache and form a renegade front) are intent on killing off the peace process. It even has time for deep emotional kickers to reinforce the point of just how tough and unlikely peace and tolerance can be sometimes.\r\n\r\nBroken Arrow was, and still is, a bold picture. In fact it can be argued that for the likes of Daves and Stewart, it was at the time very bold and risky career moves. But it paid off because the film stands up today as a picture of some distinction. It's themes and approach to its subjects are something that this generation, and all the future ones, will always find to be socially important. Boosted by Hugo Friedhofer's luscious score and taking advantage of the Lone Pine location shoot, Broken Arrow is a fine fine film that even non Western fans should be looking to absorb. 8/10"

Sure, there are the odd confrontations between the ever expanding white man and the Apache braves, but this is essentially a more cerebral look at the efforts both sides made to find an enduring peaceful solution. After months of no stagecoach and mail getting through, a pretty lightweight James Stewart (\"Tom Jeffords\") decides to try to find a better solution to their problems than the stalemate series of skirmishes between the two sides. He learns some basic Apache and goes off in search of their leader Cochise (Oscar nominated Jeff Chandler). After the usual scepticism, the two men agree to let the mail run. From then on, their trust begins to grow and the story follows their determination to cement this arrangement; despite reservations and resistance from vested interests on both sides, whilst \"Jeffords\" falls hook, line and sinker for \"Sonseeahray\" (Debra Paget). It's a touch sentimental, and it over-simplifies the problems and the solutions of the factual elements of the history, but it's still an engaging watch with a tragic but fitting conclusion and some epic cinematography along with a decent screenplay from the blacklisted Albert Maltz (who is actually credited in the version I saw)."

The pace is good, there is plenty of intrigue and as the denouement looms, I was still never quite sure who was going to come out on top.

The honest townsfolk meet and decide to hire infamous gunslinger Clay Blaisedell to act as a Marshal. Blaisdell, aided by his trusty companion Tom Morgan, proceeds to clean up the town and promptly takes control of the gambling and dance parlour. But things are rarely straight forward in a town of this type, one of the thugs (Johnny Gannon) decides to reform himself and takes on the role of legal sheriff. Things are further complicated when a woman arrives in town proclaiming that Blaisedell and Morgan killed the love of her life! This coupled with the fact that McQuown and his thugs are plotting destructive revenge, means that Warlock and it's array of complex characters are heading for judgement day - one way or another.\r\n\r\nThe basic plot sounds like nothing out of the ordinary, the tough gunslinger with a reputation hired to clean up a town has been done a fair few times, with varying degrees of success. What lifts this Edward Dmytryk directed (and produced) Western above other films of its ilk is that it goes deeper than most of those other genre pieces. Blaisedell may be a fearsome gunslinger but we are at a time when a new breed of faster and more thuggish cowboys exist, and so his very being is crucial to the number of events that transpire in Warlock. Here all central characters are multi-layered, there is a plenty going on that begs the utmost attention, where tragedy hangs heavy with its looming presence, and Dmytryk threads all the story strands together with thoughtfully potent results.\r\n\r\nAdapted by Robert Alan Aurthur from Oakley Hall's novel, Warlock boasts three excellent male lead performances and a firing on all cylinders supporting cast. Henry Fonda (Blaisedell), Richard Widmark (Gannon) and Anthony Quinn (Tom Morgan) are superb, while Dorothy Malone, Dolores Michaels, Tom Drake, DeForest Kelly, Frank Gorshin (sadly uncredited) and Wallace Ford come up trumps with excellent shows for totally important characters. The only gripe I can come up with is that I would have liked a bit more use of the Utah location courtesy of Joseph MacDonald's Cinemascope Technicolor, but since this story is primarily set within the confines of Warlock the town, one can be and is a touch forgiving.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years I have spent a lot of time revisiting the Western genre, and I have been rewarded with a ream of excellent adult pieces by the likes of Anthony Mann, Henry King and Budd Boetticher. Few of them are as undervalued, and maybe as forgotten, as this first class effort from all involved, it's a must see for any serious Western fan. 9/10"

Anthony Quinn plays the former’s faithful sidekick.\r\n\r\n“Warlock” (1959) is an adult Western cut from the same dramatic cloth as similar late 50s/early 60’s Westerns like “Man of the West” (1958). The mature and psychological script was based on Oakley Hall’s novel, which was a fictionalization of the OK Corral legends, which is why it’s not too difficult to read Earp/Holliday into the Fonda/Quinn characters and Abe McQuown’s gang as the Clanton/McLaury gang.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Quinn’s Morgan character is loosely based on Doc Holliday is a good reason to reject the supposed ‘homosexual subtext’ of Morgan. There’s not enough evidence to draw such a radical conclusion. Morgan was simply Blaisedell’s loyal and ruthless partner; he loved Blaisedell like close members of a military squad or like a brother.\r\n\r\nOn the female front we have two very striking women: Dolores Michaels plays Blaisedell’s potential babe, Jessie Marlow, while Dorothy Malone  is on hand as Lily Dollar, a mysterious woman from Blaisedell’s past who takes interest in the new deputy sheriff (Widmark).\r\n\r\nThe town scenes were filmed at 20th Century Fox Studios in Century City, CA, whereas the scenic sequences were all shot in Moab, Utah, near Arches National Park. Needless to say, the latter locations are magnificent.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"

        "content": "_**Looks great, nice action, but needed more depth**_\r\n\r\nAlthough the set-up of “Conan the Barbarian” (2011) is the same as the 1982 version (raiders destroy Conan's village in Cimmeria and thus the barbarian seeks revenge) the story is otherwise completely different. The villains here are Khalar Zym and his witchy daughter, Marique, who seek to resurrect Zym's sorcerous wife, but they need to acquire the pure blood necessary for their Acheron magic.\r\n\r\nWHAT WORKS:\r\n\r\n•Jason Momoa, as Conan, is excellent; far better than Arnie. It's hard to conceive of a better Conan. \r\n\r\n•The Bulgarian locations are outstanding. \r\n\r\n•The Costuming is more convincing than the '82 version. Conan's apparel, for instance, is more faithful to REH than Arnie's fur loincloth. \r\n\r\n•Better acting than the '82 version, excluding James Earl Jones, of course.\r\n\r\n•Brutal, thrilling action throughout with convincing swordplay (unlike the contrived ’82 version). \r\n\r\n•Corsairs, highlighted by Conan's comrade Artus, effectively played by likable Nonso Anozie. \r\n\r\n•Excellent sets/props; it definitely looks like the Hyborian Age. \r\n\r\n•Good serious vibe, despite the cartoony, over-the-top last act. \r\n\r\n•Rose McGowan as the witchy daughter is ee-vil and creepy. \r\n\r\n•Ron Perlman as Conan's father. \r\n\r\n•The whole opening sequence. \r\n\r\n•I liked how the film stressed the closeness and love of Conan and his father. There's a correlation between true greatness and a close relationship with a strong father-figure and his example of excellence. \r\n\r\n•You have to give credit to the filmmakers for effectively illustrating Conan's youthful days and life in a Cimmerian village in general, something Conan's creator never delved into in any detail.\r\n\r\nWHAT DOESN'T WORK:\r\n\r\n•The film deviates from Robert E. Howard, albeit not as much as the '82 version. Regardless, it certainly adhered to REH's overall pulp vibe. I'd prefer to see one of REH's originals put to film, like \"A Witch Shall Be Born\" or \"Beyond the Black River.\" \r\n\r\n•Stephan Lang as Zym makes a worthy enough villain for Conan, but he comes off too clichéd and cartoony, especially in the final act. James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom worked better, likely because he was so unique. \r\n\r\n•Rachel Nichols' Tamara is solid as the female protagonist, but she doesn't hold a candle to Sandahl Bergman's Valeria. \r\n\r\n•The score is serviceable but pales in comparison with Basil Poledouris' score from the '82 version and \"Conan The Destroyer\" (1984). This score definitely won't be celebrated 30 years later like Basil's. Why didn't they just update Polerdouris' piece? \r\n\r\n•There’s too much \"Modern Blockbuster Syndrome\" that appeals to those with ADHD. \r\n\r\n•Especially the over-the-top final act, which is way too comic booky. It's cartoony overkill, pure and simple. But, then again, it did bring to mind REH's \"Jewels of Gwahlur,\" so maybe it's not so far off the mark. \r\n\r\n•The biggest flaw was that there wasn't enough depth. The film needed more 'downtime' to contrast the wall-to-wall action, like campfire scenes (which would better indicate distances), more camaraderie on the ship, more development of Conan & Tamara's relationship, etc. Although it had some of this, it wasn't enough. Action sequences naturally hold more weight when the audience cares about the characters. As it is, it's clear that the filmmakers wanted to make an action flick above all else and this weakens the film. \r\n\r\n•Along with lack of depth was the lack of epic-ness or moving moments. The '82 film deviated from REH but at least it made up for it with depth and a sense of epic-ness. For instance, when Conan & Subotai make their stand against the riders of doom or Conan's moving victory salute, not to mention the potent love & death/funeral scenes, etc. This 2011 version had glimpses of this, like when Conan is birthed on the battlefield then raised to the sky and when Conan's father expresses his love with his final act, but, again, it needed more.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: The filmmakers got a lot of things right, like Momoa as Conan and the authentic look/feel of the Hyborian Age. The film's not bad at all and pulsates with energy, but it needed more depth, epic-ness and uniqueness to pull it out of its \"blockbuster\" mediocrity. It's a case of violence for the sake of violence, which gets dull by the 90-minute mark, plus the last act is just comic booky overload. The focus on wall-to-wall action limits the film's effectiveness. It lacks the confidence to chill and allow the characters to breathe. \r\n\r\nStill, it's a somewhat worthy Conan movie. It's serious and brutal; and, thankfully, lacks \"cute\" characters. It’s arguably on par with \"Conan the Destroyer\" and superior in ways, not to mention leagues better than \"Red Sonja\" (1985).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

As they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\r\n\r\n“Devil's Diary” (2007) is high school horror in the mold of \"Christine\" in which a persecuted misfit gains an advantage from some dubious source and proceeds to wreak vengeance on his or her harassers. “The Rage: Carrie 2” and \"The Unhealer\" are other examples of this subgenre.\r\n\r\nWhile this one isn’t as good as those three films, it thankfully breaks from formula 40 minutes in, which places it in the ballpark of TV occult horror flicks like “Bay Coven” and \"Satan's School for Girls\" (2000). Although it’s not as good as the former, it’s superior to the latter (the 1973 version as well). As a television production, there’s a simplicity and comic book air to the proceedings.

Several centuries later, in the 1970s, two girls named Virginia and Betty go on a trip together with a guy named Roger. After a pathetic soap opera incident, Virginia gets jealous of her friends and jumps off the train. Landing on a strange place, she finds shelter in some kind of forsaken fortress in ruins. Unfortunately, that place is also a shelter for some hideously frightening creatures that become alive during the nightfall until dawn. Those creatures are, in fact, the Templar Knights, who come back to life as zombies every night.\r\n\r\nDirector Armando de Ossorio didn't try to please a blood-thirsty audience that wanted brutal killings for an hour and a half. For the contrary, the body count may be humble, but \"La noche del terror ciego\" takes the zombie subgenre to a different level, in which the creatures are more dark, mysterious and frightening than gory and brutal. If you are a zombie lover, you're probably going to love this film and if you are not, you might be pleasantly surprised by this.\r\n\r\nI have read on the message boards that there were a lot of gore lovers dissatisfied by the lack of blood and guts, but I think this film contains a pretty well-brought-up amount. My favorite scene in the entire movie is one in which one of the girls is trying to hide from the zombies. Since the zombies are blind, the girl stays in the same room with them and the only thing she can do to remain undetected, is staying absolutely quiet. But since she's so afraid and tense, her heart starts beating more and more quickly and all of a sudden, we see a close-up of her chest, pointing out that she's on the verge of either fainting or running for her life. The living dead knights hear those heartbeats and turn to the poor girl, who has no choice but finally running away in fear, trying to avoid the nightmarish creatures. This was perhaps one of the most atmospheric situations I have ever seen in a zombie flick. To be honest, most of the chasing sequences were practically faultless, but that one in particular had to be remarked. Reading the message boards, I also came across some people who also complained about a few unresolved questions like: \"How could the zombies hear?\", \"Where did they get the horses?\" \"How come they were so strong if they were only skeletons?\". The answer to all those questions could be: \"this is a horror movie about living dead creatures and it's really not supposed to be realistic\". To be honest, I think the zombies were more believable than the pointless lesbian story between the two girls, which didn't serve a purpose to the story. Then again, most couples in horror movies make no sense, anyway."

The younger actors from necessity need to carry a movie like this, and I thought they did a grand job.

I also thought Bernard Cribbins did a wonderful job as Perks, crusty on the surface, but only on the surface, and full of energy and enthusiasm bringing the role to life. The rest of the ensemble cast were fine also. It was well worth watching.

        "content": "John Brahm’s The Locket (1946), or “What Nancy Wanted”\r\n\r\nWritten by Wheeler Winston Dixon\r\n\r\nThere are certainly any number of labyrinthianly complicated noirs, but nothing can quite prepare the viewer for the experience of watching John Brahm’s The Locket (1946), famous for its “flashback within a flashback within a flashback” structure, perhaps the most convoluted narrative in the history of noir. The plot itself is relatively simple: Nancy (Laraine Day) is a kleptomaniac, driven to steal anything that strikes her fancy (the original title of the film was “What Nancy Wanted”). Nancy’s compulsion springs from a childhood incident, in which she was given a locket as birthday gift, which was then taken away from her by the cruel Mrs. Willis (Katherine Emery), her mother’s employer. When the locket goes missing, Nancy is suspected of having stolen it to recover the trinket for herself. Although it is later discovered that the locket simply fell in the hem of a garment, Nancy is never truly exonerated. Now, twenty years later, Nancy is poised to marry John Willis (Gene Raymond), and thus regain admission to the household she was banished from as a child; Mrs. Willis does not recognize Nancy, having only known her as a child (played by Sharyn Moffet).\r\n\r\nBut within this seemingly straightforward narrative, there are numerous obstacles. The film itself begins on the day of Nancy’s wedding to John Willis. Just as the ceremony is about to begin, psychiatrist Dr. Harry Blair (Brian Aherne) breaks in demanding to see John. Dr. Blair, it turns out, was one of Nancy’s former husbands; Blair knows that Nancy is insane, and pleads with Willis not to marry her. As Blair recounts the tale of his marriage with Nancy in a flashback voiceover, he unfolds the tale of another of Nancy’s husbands, the late Norman Clyde (Robert Mitchum), a moody artist who ultimately committed suicide because of Nancy’s compulsive thefts, and her participation in a murder. All this unfolds in reverse, back to Nancy’s childhood and the incident with the locket, and then reverses to end in the present, where the still doubting John Willis, having heard Mr. Blair’s tale, confronts Nancy, who predictably denies everything.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly Nancy’s collapse at the altar, brought on by Mrs. Willis’s “re-gift” of the locket Nancy briefly had as a child, saves John Willis from a similar marital fate. As The Locket ends, Nancy is taken off to an asylum ostensibly for a cure, but the camera remains within the gloomy precincts of the Willis family’s gloomy Fifth Avenue mansion. What has transpired has left a mark not only on Nancy, but all who knew her, and even Dr. Blair’s supposed skill as a psychiatrist is useful only after the fact. For most of the film, Nancy’s mania eludes detection, and everyone who discovers her secret is summarily destroyed. Thus, all surfaces are suspect, all appearances deceiving, and nothing is to be taken at face value, especially protestations of innocence.\r\n\r\nDirector John Brahm keeps a firm hand on the proceedings, and effectively stages The Locket so that most of it happens at night, on claustrophobic studio sets. Mitchum, a rising star at the time, is oddly convincing as Norman Clyde, a Bohemian artist with attitude to spare, and Nicholas Musuraca’s moody lighting leaves the characters, and the viewer, in a state of continual confusion and suspense. Most intriguing, of course, is the triple-flashback structure of the film, which brings into question the reliability of the film’s narrative. When Dr. Blair bursts in on John Willis and begins his recital of Nancy’s crimes, Blair’s flashback contains Norman Clyde’s reminiscences, which in turn contain Nancy’s own memories of her childhood, as told to Norman, containing the incident of the locket.\r\n\r\nThus, we have only Nancy’s word, through Norman, and then through Dr. Blair, that any of this is really true, and yet we unquestionably believe in the veracity of all three statements. Why? The entire story is so fantastic that one can understand John Willis’s lack of trust in Blair’s accusations; Nancy seems like a “nice girl.” The failed wedding that climaxes the film is proof enough of Nancy’s affliction, but are all the details of her illness quite correct? For this, we have only the word of three narratives that enfold each other like miniature Chinese boxes, refusing to give up their secrets, opening only when the proper pressure is applied to the correct location.\r\n\r\nThe world of The Locket is one of absolute doom and betrayal. The relationship you thought would last forever is doomed. Your friends don’t believe you. The police don’t believe you. You can’t even trust yourself; indeed, you are your own worst enemy. Powerless before the forces of fate, which have once again capriciously decided to deal you a new, much more unpleasant future from the bottom of the deck, you simply have to take it on the chin and hope for the best. The world of The Locket is the domestic sphere in peril, in collapse, existing outside the normative values of postwar society, values that are themselves constantly in a state of flux. The family unit is constantly celebrated in the dominant media as the ideal state of social existence, but is it, when so much is at risk, and so much is unexplained? For Nancy in The Locket, the answer is a resounding no.  http://www.noiroftheweek.com/2009/04/locket-1946.html"

        "content": "Don't tell me your conscience is bothering you? \r\n\r\nThe locket is directed by John Brahm and based on a screenplay written by Sheridan Gibney, which in turn is adapted from the story \"What Nancy Wanted\" written by Norma Barzman. It stars Laraine Day, Brian Aherne, Robert Mitchum and Gene Raymond. Music is by Roy Webb and cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca. \r\n\r\nStory tells of how a bride to be, who as a child was traumatised by a false charge of stealing, grows up to badly affect the men who wander into her life. \r\n\r\n\"You don't know the truth from lies, you are just a love sick quack\" \r\n\r\nA psychological melodrama with film noir flecks, The Locket turns out to be a most intriguing picture. Director Brahm brings into the production not only his baroque know how, where his Germanic keen eye for mood is so evident in films like The Lodger and Hangover Square, but also a dizzying array of flashbacks in a collage of psychological murkiness. Structured as it is, film can be disorientating if one isn't giving the film the undivided attention it needs. But for those all in with it, it delivers rewards a plenty, even if some daft touches stop it from being an essential picture for the genre seeker. Essentially the film is a case study of one young female mind deeply affected to the point that it has great implications on those who become involved with her. \r\n\r\nStory raises some queries about the treatment of mental health patients, and their place in society, while some of the characterisations have good dramatic worth. Sheridan Gibney does a very good job with the screenplay, the tricky subject is given some thoughtful consideration whilst toying with the audience's loyalties about possible femme fatale, Nancy (Day), the ambivalence of which makes the ending from a writing standpoint far better than it probably has any right to be. Credit is due to Brahm, then, for bringing it home safely after employing such a tricky narrative device, it's far from being up with his best work, but it does showcase what a talent the German émigré was - the visual grab of the finale a case in point. \r\n\r\nOf the cast it's the very pretty Laraine Day (latterly of I Married a Communist) who shines in a tricky role, while there's a nice stern performance in the support slots from Katherine Emery as Mrs. Mills. Mitchum was yet to find his acting marker (which would come the following year in Out of the Past and Crossfire), and here he's a touch miscast and gets by on presence alone - with his character getting one of the films' duffer leaps in logic moments, literally! and Aherne is passable and easy to listen to, but never really convinces as a psychiatrist. Musuraca photographs in suitable black and white shadowy tones, but like Brahm and Mitchum, this is far from the upper echelons of his best work. \r\n\r\nIf you can get past some daft touches and crucially pay attention, The Locket is well worth the time spent with it. 7/10"

There’s the senator’s daughter, Luanne (Page Hannah); the engaged or encaged Carson (Phoebe Cates); the wannabe Hollywood starlet Malaina (Bridget Fonda); and the thinks-she’s-still-fat-but-she’s-not Pudge (Annabeth Gish).\r\n\r\nThe movie plays like a melding of “American Graffiti” (1973), “Dirty Dancing” (1987) and “Mystic Pizza” (1988). It’s far superior to the overrated “American Graffiti” and lacks the idiot subplot of “Dirty Dancing” (see my reviews of both for details). \r\n\r\nThe script thrusts the four girls into the weekend festivities at Myrtle Beach as quickly as possible wherein the story splits into several vignettes that intertwine. The weekend highpoints include: A beauty contest on the beach, a wild house party at the senator’s vacation home (unbeknownst to him, of course) and a shag dance contest. Thematically, the flick tries to advocate the wise middle ground between life-stifling legalism and foolish libertinism.     \r\n\r\nSome have called this a “chick flick” and I can see why since the focus is on the four girls, but there’s just as much here for dudes to relate. For instance, there are several voluptuous cuties on display, both in the main cast and in the periphery. Kudos to the director for his excellent eye for women. Bridget Fonda is particularly showcased in all her glory with her white bikini scenes being a highlight. She was 23 when the film was shot in 1987. There are also several prominent guys in the cast: Harley (Tyrone Power Jr.), Buzz (Robert Rusler), Chip (Scott Coffey), Jimmy Valentine (Jeff Yagher) and, to a lesser extent, the manager (Paul Lieber) and Big Bob (Jay Baker).\r\n\r\nLastly, the movie features a great period soundtrack with excellent cuts like “Stay” by The Voltage Brothers, performed (lip-synced) at The Pavilion.           \r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 38 minutes and was shot entirely in South Carolina (Georgetown, Myrtle Beach & Florence).

        "content": "Unthinkable raises a question which has been an issue for many people all over the world for a very long time, and especially since 9/11. This question is, is it ever justified to torture an individual to save the lives of many? And if the answer is yes, how far can you go?\r\n\r\nThis issue is indeed a very sensitive subject and I think it takes guts for any filmmaker to put it out there in the open like Gregor Jordan did. Add to that the clever fact that he doesn't actually make a choice, but rather lets the audience decide on whatever they want to think and feel, and you have a pretty gutsy and controversial concept.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, this film is about a man of American descent who has become a Muslim and has now, as an act of terrorism, planted 3 nuclear bombs in 3 major American cities which will go off in four days. Screenwriter Peter Woodward made some very tactical decisions considering the characters in the story. They are all somewhat stereotypical, but this is no bother because they're all there for a reason. Carrie-Anne Moss, as an FBI investigator, represents the conscience, the sensitivity and the struggle to make the right decision. Samuel L. Jackson is her polar opposite; the brutal, rational, stone cold \"interrogator\" who does what he does because he's the only one who can and willing to do it. The means he is willing to go to in order to get his subject to talk are almost as unwatchable as they are unthinkable. This is quite possibly the most gruesome film I have ever seen, but that mostly has to do with the fact that the things you see are in fact very real. This stuff does happen, and it's way harder to stomach than any slasher horror movie because it sucks you in emotionally. Intelligence agencies and secret services the world over DO use these techniques, whether we like to believe it or not.\r\n\r\nAll of this sounds like a great opportunity to address a major issue and stimulate people to really think about it, doesn't it? One would like to think so, alas there is one big problem: bad writing. As hard as they try, the filmmakers do not, at any point, manage to evoke sympathy on either side of the fence. Not with the terrorist, for the complete lack of background and motivation, but neither with the people who try to stop him from executing his horrible plans that could claim the lives of millions of people. Especially Carrie-Anne Moss' character, Brody, is quite a pain in the butt because even though her struggle is understandable, quite simply because she's a decent human being, she comes off as kind of naive because she – from a professional point of view – is unwilling to sacrifice the life of one to save millions. Her constant interference gradually becomes increasingly annoying, up to the point that you just want her to get out of the way. However, Jackson's character H. turns out to be such a volatile psycho that you almost start to feel sorry for the terrorist! There is one scene in particular which throws you off so badly that you really don't know what to think anymore. I'll only say that it involves the terrorist's wife, and as much as I would like to warn you, I don't want to give any spoilers, but you can take it as a warning anyway... It'll make your skin crawl. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are about as lively and relevant as cardboard-cut-outs, I've already forgotten about most of them, but they don't really matter to the story anyway. However, all of this could have still turned into a decent film, if it wasn't for one major flaw: the horrible ending. It's so incredibly hollow and unsatisfactory that it leaves you wondering why the hell you just spent an hour and a half watching a man being tortured, if there was absolutely no point to it?! It could have been worthwhile if only the filmmakers had any resolve to offer, but there is none. Why did the terrorist do what he did? We don't know. Did the agents accomplish anything? Not really. So what's the point? There is no point. It's just 90 minutes of torture, bad decisions and failure. That's it. \r\n\r\nOverall, it's not all bad. There is some really good dialogue and despite aforementioned flaws and inconsistencies in the script, there are a few really good scenes which do involve one into the minds of the people on screen. The actors do the best they can with what they're given, Samuel L. Jackson is as reliable as ever and Carrie-Anne Moss is convincing in her role, which makes me sad to think that since The Matrix and Memento, she hasn't really had any memorable roles, and that's too bad because she is a good actress. Michael Sheen as the terrorist is good too, though it's hard for him to make his character a 3-dimensional human being because the writers offered him no history or character development whatsoever, but he definitely makes his character's \"in-the-moment emotions\" work from scene to scene.\r\n\r\nSo, final conclusion. I wouldn't really dissuade anyone from watching this film, you now know what to expect and it does offer some interesting food for thought here and there, but you should really understand that this film is pretty challenging, mentally as much as physically. And don't watch this if you're under 18. Seriously.\r\n_(November 2013)_"

Nothing new so far, nor indeed anywhere really, as a team of human hoteliers and local islanders try to fight off this threat. The visual effects are OK - the monsters; explosions and acting are low budget, but together keep this fun yarn moving along fine.

It stars George Raft, Lynn Bari, Virginia Huston, Joseph Pevney, Myrna Dell and Edward Ashley. Music is by Leigh Harline and cinematography by Harry J. Wild.\r\n\r\nWhen Hollywood composer Keith Vincent (Ashley) is found dead in his swanky abode, the police feel it is a clear case of suicide. But there is one exception, Joe Warne (Raft), who feels it just doesn't add up. When it becomes apparent that any number of lady friends of the composer could have killed him, Joe drives himself onwards in pursuit of the truth.\r\n\r\nComfort food noir. Nocturne is a Los Angeles based detective story that doffs its cap towards Otto Preminger's far superior \"Laura\". Raft is in suitably understated hard-bitten mode as Joe Warne risks more than just the wrath of his bosses when he becomes obsessed with finding a woman called Dolores. He is convinced she has committed a murder and the gap on the wall where a row of ladies photographs hang only fuels his obsession still further.\r\n\r\nAs director Marin (\"Johnny Angel\") balances the opposing lifestyles of the principal players, taking us for a trip through the varying haunts of Los Angeles, the dialogue is pungent enough to overcome the failings of the script. A script evidently tampered with by Raft and leading to a rushed and not entirely satisfying finale. But as a mystery it works well enough as the acid tongued dames are dangled in the narrative to keep the viewer as interested as our intrepid detective is.\r\n\r\nMarin does a grand job of mixing suspense with action, even opening the picture with a doozy of a plot set-up that is born out by some lovely fluid camera work, and while Wild's (\"Murder, My Sweet\") photography and Harline's music barely break the boundaries of mood accentuation, the tech credits are admirably unfurled to ensure the picture remains in credit. It helps that the support cast is a roll call of strong \"B\" movie players, and Raft fans get good value from an actor who was desperately trying to get away from the thuggish characters he was by then becoming known for. 7/10"

As much as Pete Walker’s fans don’t want to believe it, there is no social comment being made, no hidden agenda or attempts to push the boundaries of British horror in visual or thematic achievements. Walker, a very likable and honest man, even says his films are not for deep cranial pondering, he couldn’t believe his luck that he got to throw blood and guts about and got paid for it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrightmare is a thinly plotted and written picture that serves only to bask in some shock and awe scenes. The ineptitude of the mental health authorities is given a cursory glance, but really the picture plods from one scene to the next waiting for Dorothy to get busy with her tool kit. It’s there, with the wonderfully scary Keith doing her stuff, where Walker excels. Though in today’s desensitised age it’s more fun than frightening, while there’s actually not as much gore on show as you would think. It’s all very basic in truth, but Walker achieved his aims back then, and kudos to him for serving up a truly bleak finale. 5/10"

Loads of possible culprits; some eerily lit settings, a bit of gently cerebral humour and the sight of his assembled family at a dinner table that would have made even the \"Walton's\" blush all helps the mystery develop nicely. Lugosi is effective as the clearly dubious mystic, and there's an early turn from the handsome Robert Young to look out for, too. It's well directed, written and the suspense builds nicely. Oland presents a \"rotundness\" of spirit with his performance; his frequent adages delivered with his tongue in his cheek - and I enjoyed this."

It is just that everything is what I would expect, or at least hope for, in this kind of movie. The entire movie is just right in some old-fashioned way.

I would incline myself to the second option, actually. I was never really a big fan of sexploitation films and as a consequence, I never paid them too much attention in the first place. Nevertheless, I desperately needed to check \"The Curious Dr Humpp\" (aka \"La venganza del sexo\"), since it was a national horror film and there aren't many of those out there. I actually wanted to like this film very bad for what it was. I had read many positive reviews and had some really high hopes that ended up shattered.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Curious Dr. Humpp\", a mad scientist under the name of Dr. Zoide, starts kidnapping young couples while they're having sex, or simply lusty boys and girls having fun by themselves. It appears that this mad scientist takes some kind of fluid that is segregated only by people with sexual appetite. With these fluids, Dr. Zoide becomes more and more powerful and as a consequence, young boys and girls begin to disappear in the streets of Buenos Aires. No one seems to know what is going out there, but a journalist named George starts taking care of the situation individually, until he finally comes across the awful truth about Dr. Zoide, the talking brain and the clumsy creature.\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate Mr Vieyra's noble effort of making a national sexploitation film throughout the sixties (although it was released in the early seventies), I will not say that I enjoyed this movie just out of courtesy. On the other hand, I support this film in a way, because it seems like it was some kind of way to mock the other national movies that came out all through that period of time. Back then, there was a large number of silly movies that included high voltage scenes, filled with breasts and unnecessary sex. I believe Mr. Vieyra's creation, was a way to poke fun at those films without actually falling into harsh criticism and why not use a monstrous avenger for that?. So basically, while I appreciate the mocking wink to the other sexploitation films back then, I'm still not a big fan of this film. \"The Curious Dr. Humpp\", basically offers 85 minutes of nonsense that personally, I didn't find very amusing, although it seems like many other folks did. I'm not entirely convinced about a film that for the most part contains lots of naked guys and girls everywhere, some unintentionally amusing scenes in which we see a stiff creature walking around clumsily, an evil talking brain inside a jar, catchy music and laughable acting from the beginning until the end. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who actually wants to see a horror movie."

The situation is complicated by a smooth arts patron (Terence Morgan) whom members of the expedition meet on the vessel returning to London.  \r\n\r\n“The Curse of the Mummy’s Tomb” (1964) is the second of four Mummy films by Hammer; the others being “The Mummy” (1959), “The Mummy’s Shroud” (1967) and “Blood from the Mummy's Tomb” (1971). While they all have similar plots, each can be enjoyed as a standalone movie and I prefer this one to the overrated first flick, which overdid it with the dull Egyptian rituals and citations of sacred scrolls, amongst a couple other flaws. I also prefer it to the minor cult-favorite “Blood from the Mummy’s Tomb.”\r\n\r\nWhile towering Christopher Lee made for the most terrifying mummy in the first film, there’s more to a mummy flick than the monster. This one throws in a spirit of high adventure with the ship voyage, as well as a thought-provoking back story that is slowly revealed (I’m talking about the story of Ra and his brother), which explores the problem of immortality while stuck in a fallen world. It may sound good at first, but is it really? In other words, eternal life is only agreeable in a redeemed Universe.\r\n\r\nOn top of this is the subtle romantic triangle between John (Ronald Howard), Annette (Jeanne Roland) and Adam (Terence Morgan). A critic referred to Annette as a “wanton hussy,” but she is actually classy and cultured. Her betrothal to John obviously isn't set in stone in light of her comments to Adam. Plus it’s clear that John isn’t very interested in Annette while the well-to-do and cultured Adam slickly woos her; and it doesn’t hurt that Adam is the more handsome of the two men by far. You don't have to be an Einstein to see why Annette starts to veer toward Adam. Meanwhile she's not portrayed as having casual sex with anyone, so I'm not sure how exactly she could be accused of being a hussy. Roland, incidentally, is part Burmese and went on to play Bond's curvy masseuse in “You Only Live Twice” (1967).\r\n\r\nElsewhere Fred Clark’s character, Alexander King, is a well-developed and entertaining individual. On the surface he’s a crass, money-obsessed American promoter but, underneath, he has a spirit of joie de vivre and you can’t help but see that he truly wants to share the marvels of Egyptology with the common person. In other words, his motivations aren’t entirely selfish; he WANTS to share and educate, albeit in an entertaining and convenient manner, not to mention make loads of lucre doing it. His encounter with a prostitute on the streets of London also reveals a warm heart in a (seemingly) throwaway scene. Lastly, when he comes face-to-face with the mummy, there’s initial shock and marvel, but then a smile of carny glee. \r\n\r\nThis all reflects exceptional writing that makes “The Curse of the Mummy’s Tomb” one of the best in the Hammer series and, arguably, the best.     \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 21 minutes, and was shot at Elstree Studios, Borehamwood, just northwest of London.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"

Can they stop it from killing everyone who desecrated the tomb and save \"Annette\" (an equally mummified effort from Jeanne Roland) from it's more amorous clutches? It's actually a little more brutal than your average Hammer fayre, this - not that it would be more than a 12 by modern day standards - and that helps keep it moving, but only after an exceptionally slow and plodding build up that drags as surely as the mummy's footsteps. The acting talent works well enough and the dialogue is, at best, incidental to this retelling of a familiar story. I like this genre of film, so quite enjoyed watching it again."

Things are further complicated when De Niro gets romantically involved with Harris sister played by Baker.\r\n\r\nWonderfully sedate and intimate, Jacknife, whilst not creating anything new in the “coming home from Nam” genre of film, is somewhat refreshing in how it relies on dialogue and believable character interactions. Some cliches do find their way into the play later in the day as Harris’ character starts to come out of is troubled shell, but this is mostly a thoughtful treatment of loneliness and the on going effects of the war. The three up top performances are well delivered, with De Niro unsurprisingly carrying the film with ease.\r\n\r\nA box office flop on release, there’s a good chance that Jones’ film came too late in the Vietnam War movie cycle. It’s also safe to say that the slow pace and the dialogue heavy nature of it made it only appealing to a certain demographic of film lovers. It’s worth seeking out now as an anti-dote to blunderbuss blockbusters, because it’s good film making that has a story that is touching and often humorous, and for many of a certain era, it’s all too real. 7/10"

What now ensues is a romp through the (Sri Lankan) jungle facing perilous creatures intent on eating everyone, irked natives intent on eating everyone and a cannibal god who is, well, intent on eating everyone... To be fair, the photography is quite lively amidst the foliage, but the acting is almost as bad as the dialogue and by the change to the third reel, most of the audience were firmly hoping that the poisoned darts might be heading our way instead!

They require her for some diabolical ritual. Honor Blackman has a peripheral role.\r\n\r\nThe story of \"To the Devil a Daughter\" (1976) is loosely based on Dennis Wheatley's 1953 novel. It was Hammer's answer to American horror hits like \"The Exorcist\" (1973) and \"Rosemary's Baby\" (1968), but Wheatley was furious with the numerous changes and called the film \"obscene.\"\r\n\r\nIt's a slow-burn occult-oriented mystery with good locations and a notable cast. Producers seemed to have more money to work with in this regard than most Hammer films. Speaking of Hammer, \"To the Devil a Daughter\" doesn't FEEL like a Hammer picture from the '60s and early '70s, which is a nice (and unsuspected) change, I guess.\r\n\r\nFor those who care, Kinski is shown completely naked from the front near the end, which was/is controversial since she was still 14 years-old during shooting, almost 15. Unfortunately Lee is also show in the nude, albeit from behind. One thing I never cared to see in life was Christopher Lee's butt (actually, it was his stunt double, Eddie Powell).\r\n\r\nThere's a fairly shocking and obscene \"devil baby\" sequence. The creators obviously wanted to take \"Rosemary's Baby\" to the next level. In any case, they did a good job with the infant F/X, at least for the mid-70s.\r\n\r\nWhile the mystery is sometimes interesting the story is flat and the last act somehow doesn't work. Yes, they throw in some bizarre things — the aforementioned \"devil baby\" scene and a wild satanist orgy (which is more silly than shocking) — but I was left feeling disappointed.\r\n\r\nThis was Hammer's penultimate film and their final horror production. Surprisingly, \"To the Devil a Daughter\" was a hit and made lots of money, at least in Europe, but Hammer Studios had debts to pay and the movie's success couldn't save 'em.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, it's okay at best, but not as good as flicks like \"Bay Coven\" (1987), \"The Crimson Cult\" (1968), \"The Devil Rides Out\" (1968) and \"Race With the Devil\" (1975).   \r\n\r\nThe DVD includes an informative and entertaining 24-minute \"making-of\" documentary that discusses the film and the demise of Hammer Studios called \"To the Devil... The Death of Hammer.\" It features interviews with Lee, Blackman, the director, the producer and many more. By all accounts Widmark was arrogant and a real bastage to work with. The Hollywood \"star\" frequently insulted the English filmmakers (calling the picture a \"Micky Mouse production\"), walking off the set, arguing, brawling and kicking over expensive equipment (!). Every aspect of the movie is addressed, including changes from the novel, Wheatley's objections, the ending's failure, etc.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the documentary is way more compelling than the film itself and is available on Youtube for those interested.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot mostly in the greater London area of England, including Elstree Studios, with a bit in Bavaria, Germany.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-"

It’s a spare change Indie, but the director/writer (Kerry Beyer) is proficient and so the filmmaking is professional with quality locations, lighting, photography, gore, sound and score/soundtrack. Even the no-name cast rises to the challenge with an amusingly campy approach, although there are a couple of scenes with noticeably dubious “acting.”\r\n\r\nBeyer wisely includes all the staples of the slasher genre and, best of all, knows how to photograph women. The standouts are Katy Rowe (Amber), Denise Williamson (Monica), Amy Morris (Lindsay), Julin (Rachel) and Sarah McCulley /Thygeson (Beth); superb job on this front.\r\n\r\nWith the campy vibe I had doubts that the story would remain compelling over the course of the slightly overlong runtime (for an Indie slasher, that is), but Beyer keeps things moving and I eventually found myself taking the events fairly seriously (surprisingly). A plus is that I couldn’t predict who the killer turns out to be. A minus is that he shoulda toned down the crudity, but it’s not as bad as some flicks, e.g. the tasteless “American Pie,\" and he was obviously aiming to amuse. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour and 36 minutes and was shot in Cleveland, Texas (a 2.5 hour drive south of Lake Tyler), with the suburban scenes done in Houston.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

At best I guess it was a bootcamp.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the characters are mostly flavorless, and the dialogue and cinematography is pretty low quality.  Roxy Vandiver carries the movie for most of it, but she arguably has the most poorly developed character in the story.\r\n\r\nThe movie's biggest strength is a clear knowledge and application of horror tropes, using them in both an expected manner and refreshingly surprising manner.  I think that's what the movie is probably best known for: a few great moments.\r\n\r\nHorror fans will probably like this, but I imagine it will disappoint a lot of general audiences."

Robert Young plays the leader of the scientists.\r\n\r\n\"Secret of the Incas\" (1954) is an adventure flick that became the blueprint for Indiana Jones in the 80s, the first film of course being the exceptional “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” While Harry Steele (Heston) certainly dresses like Indiana Jones, he’s not a noble professor; he’s a cynical and avaricious treasure hunter, not to mention opportunist. In the last act there is a tomb sequence featuring a revealing shaft of light similar to the Map Room scene in “Raiders.”\r\n\r\nBeing shot in 1953, this naturally has a quainter tone by comparison. The first 45 minutes, for instance, entirely take place in a remote Andes town with a lot of talk and little action, which might turn off fans of Indiana Jones. But I enjoyed Heston’s towering presence and nonchalant mojo. His character, Harry Steele, is similar to Taylor in “Planet of the Apes” (1968), just fourteen years younger.\r\n\r\nThe Andes sequences are scenic and striking Peruvian vocalist Yma Sumac plays the role of Kori-Tica with a couple of extraordinary singing sequences. Meanwhile Nicole Maurey is sharp as the Romanian defector, Elena.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in Peru at Cuzco and Machu Picchu with (obvious) studio scenes done at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. The studio sets are surprisingly well done and convincing enough.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/B"

For the venom and bile that gets spewn by fans of said franchises when filmic adaptations don't meet expectations - can get quite scary at times!\r\n\r\nThe Green Hornet was released in 2011 and I remember how poorly it was received by the fans of the origin productions. Nothing new there in reality, Green Lantern, that was also released this same year, received the same treatment. So how does something like The Green Hornet stack up to someone who's just after a mindless couple of hours of high energy thrills and witty repartee?\r\n\r\nIs it funny? Is it packed with action? Is it showcasing some nifty set pieces, some nifty set design and some bonkers escapism? Well the answer is yes to all of those. The writing away from the gags is nothing to get excited about (Cameron Diaz gets short shrift on the page), while if you have an aversion to Seth Rogen this is a film to make you choke on your own vomit, but to the standard super hero/crime fighting frolics fan, this has it all. Including Christoph Waltz having a great time as the villain and Jay Chou being simply wonderful.\r\n\r\nFart gun and disco santa, bromance and car carnage, delightful. Sorry Hornet purists, it's a riot. To me at least... 7.5/10"

A masked hero with a martial arts expert and mechanical genius as his side kick and a really cool car. Not one of those ridiculous wimpy ones but a real old-fashioned American car having a large V8 engine with the proper sound and everything. So what could go wrong?\r\n\r\nWell a lot! Half way through the movie I was wondering how bloody stupid the producer really thought the audience was. The bad guy was a total joke. Completely wacko in a very stupid way. Not fun at all. But the worst thing was that the hero, played by Seth Rogen, was even more stupid. He was nothing but a dumbass, loudmouthed, idiot throughout the entire movie. Even when he wasn’t directly screwing up just the fact that he was in the scene and opened his mouth was enough to ruin it.\r\n\r\nAnd what about these ridiculous slow motion scenes with the targets flashing red just before some action taking place? The guys where not supposed to have real superpowers so stop making it look like they had for Christ sake! Seth Rogen had a part in writing the script as well and that was probably a huge mistake. Scripts should be left to professionals and not wannabe comedians."

I'm not sure why it started, and I don't feel like researching it.\r\n\r\nThis movie, looks like it just lifted part of Seth Rogen's life and put a Green Hornet skin on it.  I'm sure he pays some asian guy to perform martial arts for him while he parties.  Jokes aside, it was nice to see Rogen hit his limit on a believable action front: which does involve someone else (in this case, Jay Chou)  doing most of the work.\r\n\r\nRogen fits right into the role of a spoiled, obnoxious party boy, but even though he's supposed to be the funny one, Jay Chou is just as funny with Cameron Diaz putting out some humor as well.\r\n\r\nI'm clearly not a Seth Rogen fan, and I don't think I'm a Green Hornet fan: I'm realizing I'm not even a Batmobile fan just now.  I guess I'm not into cool cars, and a firefight is a firefight, having a gas gun isn't interesting.\r\n\r\nAll said and done, it's a good experience, there are just a lot of other movies, even \"super\" hero movies to watch before this."

Fight scenes are really good and pretty savage in parts.  There's an awesomely ridiculous shot of a guy's head taking a fatal punch via x ray at one point. Sonny pulls a man's tackle off at another.  It's Sonny vs. The mob but they can't really be arsed with guns.\r\n\r\nPure entertainment and stands out among martial arts films.  There are also 2 decent sequels but this is the best of them.

It stars Wendell Corey, Evelyn Keyes, Elsa Lanchester, Marie Windsor, Nancy Gates and Leonard Strong. Music is by R. Dale Butts and cinematography by John L. Russell.\r\n\r\nFilmed and set in Hawaii, one could be forgiven for thinking this couldn't possibly work as a piece of film noir. In fact, the opening credit sequences lends one to think this could well be a frothy Elvis Presley type of movie - but it most assuredly isn't.\r\n\r\nCash or Cave in?\r\n\r\nStory has Corey up to his neck in femme fatales, shifty criminal acquaintances and coppers. Which is not bad for a guy who was apparently killed during the attack on Pearl Harbor! The Hell's Half Acre of the tile is what is termed in the film as a shabby tenement district, this is the seedy underbelly of what we know as the paradise island. The location makes for some excellent atmospheric noir touches, with the production line abodes and the ream of wooden stairs and banisters making for a moody backdrop. At night the shadows come in to play, hanging nicely off of the alleyways and tawdry bars.\r\n\r\nDirty Rat!\r\n\r\nThough a little too contrived for its own good, the many characterisations on show make the annoying itches easily scratched. From two-timing dames and thugs in need of anger management - to alcoholic slobs and batty taxi drivers, this has a roll call of colourful people drifting in and out of Hell's Half Acre. There's even some censor baiting going on, though the whiff of violent misogyny could have been less pungent.\r\n\r\nSome serious noir credentials are found with the makers, Auer (City That Never Sleeps), Fisher (I Wake Up Screaming), Corey (The Big Knife), Keyes (The Prowler), Windsor (The Narrow Margin), Gates (Suddenly), Lanchester (The Big Clock) and Russell (Moonrise), and that's only really scratching the surface. With its distinctive setting and well controlled unfurling of noir conventions, this is well worth a look by the noir faithful. 7/10"

Here she portrays \"Lidia\", married to \"Giovanni\" (an equally potent Marcello Mastroianni), with whom she has a pretty open relationship in what is a rapidly deteriorating marriage. It's only after they visit a terminally ill friend \"Garani\" (Bernhard Wicki) that she becomes distraught, leaves the hospital and her thoughts start to focus a little. She visits the home of her youth, he goes to a party to celebrate the release of his latest tome then they both end up at a lavish soirée where they are as if independent of each other - both pretty shamelessly flirting with other, younger, people whilst maintaining just about enough of a façade to remember that this is all about business. Michelangelo Antonioni has created the ultimately crafted fly-on-the-wall film, here. The photography is intimate, almost invasive, at times as we watch these two people heading on a crash course to marital oblivion taking a great deal of themselves with them too. Though at times outwardly superficial, the characterisations are actually quite complex and both play with a subtle, nuanced charisma that compliments the more obvious symptoms of their declining interest in each other. What also adds a richness to this is a distinct paucity of dialogue. Giorgio Gaslini has provided us with a score that allows the photography to tell us great swathes of the story using imagery only - the lack of needless conversation between the characters helps it to showcase the ostentatiousness of their ball or the use of the Milanese city-scape in the darkness illuminated only by the occassional street-light - and that frequently creates a compelling atmosphere as sterile and barren as is their failing partnership. By the end, we know that something has to give, but what might that be? For two hours it just flies by. It's Golden Bear was well won."

Released at a time when most major media resources were focused on the Vietnam War, co-directors Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi were among a very, very small group of people documenting the unrest which accompanied the decolonization of Africa. More than 50 years after its release, this is still a brutally graphic film: human death is captured on camera, up-close and unsimulated; hippopotami and elephants are attacked with spears until they resemble living pin-cushions, only expiring after suffering prolonged and agonizing brutality; human remains litter rural fields and city streets like so much discarded waste. There are several scenes where the audio appears to be altered to present the on-screen activity in a manipulated context, which was a technique employed in both MONDO CANE (1962) and MONDO CANE 2 (1963). Charges that the filmmakers were actually complicit in staging some of the death scenes led to a court case in Italy, where they were eventually acquitted. But being critical of a mondo movie for employing deception is like being critical of a baker for employing yeast; it's one of the tools at the creators' disposal. Understanding that the mondo genre in general was more concerned with titilation and shock than in absolute narrative truth will go a long way in explaining why Jacopetti and Prosperi may have felt the need to alter already potent footage: they weren't aspiring documentarians, but rather talented grindhouse purveyors who found themselves in the right place at the right time."

It's nice and airy, pleasingly performed, easy on the eye with its Technicolor photography, and De Toth once again shows himself to be a good marshal of action scenes. Crawford carries the movie of course, imbuing Sergeant Trainor with fearless bluster that holds the dysfunctional group together. The narrative strength comes from the lack of water, both for the whiteys and the Comanche, where the often forgotten weapons of war, that of food or drink, firmly keeps the story engrossing. \r\n\r\nNot as good as \"Sahara\" but still a safe recommendation to Western and Brod Crawford fans. 7/10"

Music is by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Victor Milner.\r\n\r\nRunning just shy of 70 minutes, Jeopardy is a classic lesson in how to garner great suspense from a small cast and set-up. Beginning with jaunty music and the scene setting of a family of three off for a vacation, it's all Americana bliss, but it's not long before fate deals the family some bad cards and we land firmly in thriller territory. The dialogue is safe and assured, with the stars turning in rich characterisations as written, particularly a wonderfully oily Meeker as the villain of the piece. Though very much plein air as a production, a claustrophobic and fraught air grips the play and drags the viewer in wholesale, a sense of cruel luck, danger and ironies hold things in a noir realm. While a turn of events in the narrative is deftly played, the sub-text shattering to the point we don't need to see it to feel it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately some irritants stop it from hitting the top end of the scale. Daft ironies and highly improbable contrivances chip away at the pic's other strengths, one scene has the son (Aaker) trapped on a dilapidated pier, to which his dad calls out \"stay right where you are\", I mean really, what else was the lad going to do?! Some crude back projection work also dampens down some otherwise nice production touches (Calif locales just lovely), while the ending kinda dilutes a previous moral kicker.

Does it lean more on romance than comedy? Sure, but I actually appreciated that choice. Is the story about as surface level as it gets? Yes, but I also think that the chemistry between Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher largely makes up for that flaw.

        "content": "***Four teens go to a cabin-in-the-woods to party (no, really)***\r\n\r\nReleased in early 1992, “Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil” is a slasher about a psycho priest who manifests stigmata and has a penchant for slaying fornicating teens. He escapes diocese custody in 1991 and returns to St. Basil Seminar, which has been converted into a vacation home. The only problem is that two teen couples have decided to have an alternative-to-the-prom celebration there.\r\n\r\nThe only two installments from the Prom Night series that are directly related are parts II and III, both of which involve the malevolent spirit of Mary Lou Maloney. Part I features a masked assailant and this one a crazy priest, who’s reminiscent of Marvel’s Foolkiller, which debuted some 18-19 years earlier. In any case, all four films (not including 2008’s “Prom Night”) are connected in that they begin with the 1957 prom at Hamilton High School, near Cleveland, Ohio (this location is clearly established in the original film, for anyone who cares).\r\n\r\nThe first half hour of “Prom Night IV” focuses on the local diocese and their problems with the cracked priest whom they secretly hold captive in the creepy cellar of a chapel or whatever. I thought this section of the movie was kind of boring but, at the same time, it was a nice change of pace. I liked how this installment returned to the more realistic tone of part I. The story perks up with the two girls, Meagan and Laura, played by brunette cutie Nicole de Boer and blonde tart Joy Tanner, as they prepare to sneak off to the remote summer house of one of their beau’s parents.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the plot revolves around the conventional horror staple of the cabin-in-the-woods. The good news, however, is that this “cabin” used to be a monastery and so it’s a more interesting setting for the ensuing thrills than a rinky-dink cabin.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of plot issues though. For instance, the priest doesn’t age a bit in 33 years. Even if he’s possessed by some supernatural force, this wouldn’t stop the normal aging process of the man’s body. I’m assuming that the producers simply didn’t have the funds for the make-up necessary to convincingly make him look like he was in his late-50s. So they said, “Who cares? It’s a friggin’ slasher flick.” Secondly, there’s a crank call that’s stereotypical in this genre and Meagan nonchalantly answers the phone even though the teens aren’t supposed to be at the house in the first place; and her boyfriend, whose parents own it, doesn’t object at all when he later finds out (maybe because he was focused on the matter at hand, lol).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in the Toronto area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

        "content": "**I wish someone would have delivered me from this snoozefest.**\r\n\r\nI wasn't expecting a lot from this, but it still managed to disappoint me a little bit. Slasher flicks are known for being very simple and unpretentious movies that mostly offer entertainment and gruesome kills, which \"Prom Night IV\" mostly fails to provide.\r\n\r\nIn \"Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil\", two young couples decide to go on a romantic double date, after skipping their prom, for which they head up to a big secluded house that belongs to one of the boys in the group. There, they are chased by an insane former priest, Father Jonas, who has recently escaped from where he was being kept for 30 years.\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem with \"Prom Night IV\" is that the butchery takes a long time to happen and this is a mistake in a slasher flick. Let's see, for the first ten minutes (or so), we see Father Jonas, the bad guy. He really is an interesting character, with his intense gaze and his over-the-top demeanor. Later, we are introduced to the young characters, who, clearly, are going to be stalked by the aforementioned killer. During the second half an hour, the youngsters go into the house for their romantic getaway, where we see them getting intimate and, eventually, realizing that someone is lurking around. The kills are excessively delayed and end up happening after more than 50 minutes have passed and that's just a lot of time. So, the way I see it, \"Prom Night IV\" is not even that fun, which is something that a slasher flick should always be. They can be stupid, but the carnage should begin early.\r\n\r\nThe only potentially interesting aspect of this movie was never fully developed and it was barely even displayed during the first minutes. At some point, Father Jonas, the killer, begins to mumble something, like, 'Don't touch him, not there, he's too young...', which clearly idicates that Jonas was abused as a child. It is also heavily implied that Father Jonas was a homosexual, considering that he kisses two men before attacking them. I can only assume that the priest was dealing with an inner conflict, since homosexuality is heavily disapproved by the Catholic church, which eventually resulted in a state of self-hatred and aversion towards sex, as a result of the abuse that he presumably endured as a child. Too bad this was only merely even hinted. At some point, another character explains that Father Jonas was evil because he was possessed, so, in the end, it is not exactly clear if he was deranged due to his traumas or if he was, in fact possessed. Perhaps both things? I don't think the writers even bothered with all these issues, to be honest. Father Jonas actually appears to look exactly the same age throughout the course of... 30 years! If we go by the idea that he was possessed, this could explain why he never aged (either that or he uses a very effective anti-aging treatment).\r\n\r\nThough I personally found it a little bit slow, \"Prom Night IV\" is not really a mess. The truth is that this movie has a good production value and plot-wise, it actually ticks all the boxes of a slasher flick. As for the acting, it is pretty decent for the most part. Nicole de Boer and Joy Tanner are very likeable, especially the latter one, who plays an irreverent catholic school girl (who looked like she was in her twenties, but that's okay). Then, of course, we have the kills. The body count is perhaps a little bit too modest for a slasher and the kills are just plain, but they're there. In the end, \"Prom Night IV\" is just one of those movies that don't really stay with you in any way, but it would be unfair to label them as \"unwatchable\""

An established culture of Huron living in tandem with nature, turf-warring with their Iroquois neighbours and enduring a largely substance existence are introduced to that most ultimate of plagues. Christianity! It's the eponymous \"Laforgue\" (Lothaire Bluteau) who is charged by his fellow Jesuits to travel to this remote and beautiful land in order to spread the word. Now, to be fair to this \"Black Robe\" he is tenacious. It's one hell of an effort - mostly by canoe through some of the most hostile conditions the planet has to offer - as he travels with his companions \"Daniel\" (Aden Young) and \"Annuka\" (Sandrine Holt) to the remote home of some sceptical, but nonetheless welcoming tribesfolk. \"Laforgue\" is not an evil man, but he has a job to do and the rather more simplistic religiosity of the locals which is based much more around the seasons, the harvest, the weather etc., is not really much of a match for his disciplined indoctrination of these people - especially once the church is built. The apple cart is soon well and truly upset and chief \"Chomina\" (August Schellenberg) is soon having to make tough choices to ensure the survival of his people against this new, all consuming, mysticism. Bluteau is adequate here, I wouldn't say anything more - probably Schellenburg takes the acting plaudits; but that's not so important I think. It's the message this comprehensively conveys that gives it some extra bite. It looks great. The Québec scenery, snowscapes, mountains and expanses are superbly captured as we get a sense of just how virgin this territory was before the expansion of European man and their obligatory religious baggage. It's a telling narrative that really does shout from the rooftops that their society wasn't broke so why did we try to fix it?"

        "content": "_**Tedious arty Western; thoroughly UNentertaining**_\r\n\r\nReleased in 1976 and directed by Robert Altman, \"Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson\" stars Paul Newman as Buffalo Bill Cody, the star of his famous \"Wild West Show\" in the shadow of the Rockies in 1885. After Chief Sitting Bull of Little Big Horn fame (Frank Kaquitts) arrives with his Number One (Will Sampson), Cody is irked that the chief isn't a slaughtering savage, but is silently heroic and honorable. Cody fires him, but relents when star attraction Annie Oakley (Geraldine Chaplin) sympathizes with Sitting Bull. Then President Grover Cleveland (Pat McCormick ) visits with his entourage.\r\n\r\nThis is revisionist Western, a \"message movie\" that Altman uses to criticize popular ideas or myths about the Old West. The titular hero is merely a showbiz creation who can no longer differentiate the truth from his made-up image. He's a blustering fool who asserts to be one with the Wild West, but lives in extravagance, play-acting in his Western circus. His hair is fake, he can no longer shoot straight or track a Native; and all his theatrical duels with owlhoots and Indians are fixed in his favor.\r\n\r\nThe theme is interesting and the ensemble cast is great (which also includes Burt Lancaster, Kevin McCarthy, Harvey Keitel, John Considine, Noelle Rogers, Shelley Duvall and Denver Pyle, amongst other notables). It should've worked, but it didn't. It's somewhat akin to \"Little Big Man\" (1970) but less of a comedy and nowhere near as entertaining (not that I'm a big fan of that movie or anything, but at least it has its entertaining moments). While the Wild West circus elicits some entertaining moments (e.g. rodeo stunts) they can't save the flick from being an arty, pretentious, tiresome bomb. Moreover, the principle Native Americans are ironically so one-dimensional and wooden I thought maybe Altman was making a snide aside about \"wooden Indians.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, the ideology is blatantly one-sided against the New Americans, depicting Not-as-New Americans as super-noble while conveniently ignoring their documented dark side, e.g. the heinous torture tactics most tribes inflicted on their captive enemies, including other tribes-people, so as to hinder their condition in the afterlife (the \"happy hunting grounds\" or whatever). For instance, they'd gouge out enemies' eyes or mutilate their genitals so they (supposedly) wouldn't be able to see or copulate in the after-world. Yup, that's just so virtuous (sarcasm). Actually, I could handle this lopsided perspective if the movie itself were entertaining, but that's hardly the case.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 123 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada, mostly at Stoney Indian Reserve.\r\n\r\nGRADE: D"

        "content": "Edward Dmytryk Crafts The Western King Lear.\r\n\r\nWith both it being based on Shakespeare's King Lear and being a Western remake of Joseph L. Mankiewicz's tasty film noir, House of Strangers, Broken Lance had fine sources from which to work from. Throw in to the mixer that it stars Spencer Tracy, Richard Widmark, Katy Jurado, Robert Wagner and Earl Holliman, and that Joseph MacDonald was director Edward Dmytryk's cinematographer of choice, well it's all set up to be a highly accomplished piece.\r\n\r\nAnd it is!\r\n\r\nDmytryk's film tells the story of how the Devereaux family came to implode. Father Matt {Tracy}, is a tough no nonsense pioneer who after finding a copper smelter has polluted his water, illegally raids the copper mine with destructive vengeance. Matt has four sons, his three eldest are a disappointment to him, but his youngest, Joe, from his latest marriage to a Commanche woman {Jurado}, is untainted by his own bitterness. But it's Joe who takes the rap for the copper mine raid and gets sentenced to three years jail. When Joe comes out he finds that his brothers have driven his mother away and all but destroyed the family empire, including his father. Joe {Wagner} has scores to settle, especially with the oldest, and nastiest brother, Ben {Widmark}.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay comes from Richard Murphy, who, reworked Philip Yordan's House Of Strangers screenplay, bagging Yordan the Best Writing Oscar at the 1955 Academy Awards in the process. And it's not hard to see why. Murphy and Dmytryk have fused together a number of intelligent strands in their picture. Not merely a tale of vengeance that dallies with black sheep of the family like thematics, it also serves up racial prejudice issues, and those of greed and corruption. It's for sure what one would term a talky piece, tho the copper mine raid itself is a pulse raiser, but it's with the talk and how it's put together that makes Broken Lance worthy of its place on any \"Adult Western\" list. For its court room sequences and a memorable scene involving Tracy and Widmark alone it deserves praise from the genre faithful.\r\n\r\nActing wise there are very few disappointments. Tracy is terrific, as is Widmark, while the youthful Wagner gets away with the obvious problem of him playing a half Indian, by bringing an emotionally honest integrity to the role of Joe. Katy Jurado, who was Oscar nominated for supporting actress, is sweet and showing deft sadness in the thankless role of wife and mother, Señora Devereaux. The itches are with the others, thru no fault of their own really. Both Holliman and Hugh O'Brian as the other two brothers are practically observers in proceedings, both men never really getting to add some weight into the family drama. Jean Peters as Joe's love interest, Barbara, is an important character in the story, yet she's never fully formed. Minor problems aside tho, this is an engrossing and gorgeous picture. So with Leigh Harline's lyrical score complimenting MacDonald's sumptuous Arizona photography {the film was shot in Technicolor CinemaScope and sound mixed in 4-Track Stereo} try and see this on the best system you possibly can, because it's worth it. 8/10"

For here, prehistoric creatures reside and the cowboys come up with the idea of capturing a Tyrannosaurus Rex to become the chief attraction in the circus they work at.\r\n\r\nThe makers of Gwangi never hid their motivations or homages, from the off they wanted to nod towards King Kong whilst pairing the Western and Fantasy genres in the process. The result of which is an enjoyable if unfulfilled movie that again sees Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion creations save the day. Directed by Jim O'Connolly with a screenplay by William Bast, The Valley Of Gwangi suffers not because of its bonkers plot (this is after all why we watch this type of genre offering), but more because of the slow first half that threatens to put the viewer into torpor. Thankfully the film is saved by the afore mentioned Harryhausen who unleashes prehistoric joys on the B movie cast (tho Laurence Naismith is considerably better than the material given him). While the ending raises the adrenaline sufficiently enough to have made the wait worth while. Jerome Moross lifts from his brilliant score for The Big Country with mixed results; it just feels out of place here, even if it's stirring and pleasing to the ears. And the Almería, Andalucía location work in Spain is at one with the material to hand. \r\n\r\nSaturday afternoon monster fun to be enjoyed with either popcorn or something stronger from the drinks cupboard. 6/10"

Even the lycanthrope looks the same, yet the production company is different (Tyburn, which only has seven films to its credit). \r\n\r\nWhat’s interesting is that the book “Curse of the Werewolf” was based on had the events take place in France, which was changed to Spain because an 18th century Spanish set was available. This film fixes this by placing the events in France and Paris.\r\n\r\nThe two movies are of about the same quality, but I give the edge to “Curse of” even though this one has more gore.

Many of these films take place in the South, but not always; there are tons of rednecks all over, even in the most \"progressive\" states, like California and Washington.\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around two brothers in 1954 traveling through North Carolina. After picking up a lone female, their car breaks down in Macon County where they encounter a bigoted Sheriff. A crime takes place and the sheriff blames the trio.\r\n\r\nThe film only runs 89 minutes and the first hour is all small town tedium, which is part of the movie's low-budget charm, but the third act livens things up.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay was written by Max Baer Jr., best known as Jethro on the Beverly Hillbillies TV series; he also plays the redneck Sheriff in the story. Max, incidentally, directed another redneck classic, 1976's \"Ode to Billy Joe\".\r\n\r\nThe film has a good back country vibe and effectively shows how bigotry and racism are learned traits and not innate. It also shows how easy it is to blame the wrong person due to coincidence. Beyond this, the film has little depth. It's a light drama about mundane events in a small Southern town that turn to tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe movie purports to be based on a true story and offers details to this effect, but this was merely fabricated in order to hype the picture. It worked, as \"Macon County Line\" became a drive-in hit in the mid-70s.\r\n\r\nMy main beef with the film, other than its mundaneness, is that the story takes place in Macon County, North Carolina, but the picture was shot in the Big Valley of California (around Sacramento). It goes without saying, if you're going to film a Southern Gothic thriller that takes place in the South, shoot it in the REAL South, not friggin' California. That said, the filmmakers do a decent job of making it SEEM like the South, dry as California is.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+ or B-"

        "content": "> On the one hand, the indestructible murmur, the purest and most refined literature made images of Makk's whisper, on the other, the fearsome imponderable, and idyllic staging. When the right time comes, the story of Giza and her sister Erzsi Skalla, this work, will be for those who are over 50 years old, not necessarily old or who feel that way, their favorite work and that of many like them, due to the circumspection merciless, by the spaces of silence, (\"when we remain silent we become unpleasant, when we speak we become ridiculous\", said one of my favorite European authors Herta Muller, in Herztier) by the arrhythmias of memory and of the past relived from the photo to the closed eyes, from closed eyes to the obtuse game of memory recomposition, because of the pleasure one should not feel for someone one has loved \"Erzsi, I wouldn't even have recognized you on the street, my angel\", because of melancholy that it should not be shown when playing that piano piece, together with Viktor and his emphysema, because of the friend Paula, because of the jealousy of older sister to younger or vice versa, also being redheaded, because of the shameful confidences of the elderly-other people that we we will see forced You will recognize them, like children who cheated on an exam, or broke a piece of china and hid it from adults. We will remember that since we were children we wanted to beat our older or younger brother, and now that we are old, not so young, little or nothing has changed our immature desires for disinterested truth and empty usefulness. We are faced with a supreme double touch of genius from Károly Makk; both for the style, epistolary, fantastic without completely detaching feet from the realistic,... as for the motif, of a roots deeply committed to the nostalgia of what has vanished. I did not quote Muller gratuitously, like her, although for different autobiographical reasons, Karoly Makk has an amazing, unique musicality, an impressive narrative plasticity for those of us who love detail. To make matters worse, returning to Erzsi's little drama, as if the sudden memories, the visit of the impossible love, especially since she insisted on canceling it with a telegram that did not arrive or was ignored by Viktor, the fortuitous meeting despite the rejection letter, as if the smell of experiences or the dry leaf kept in good times and found inside a book in bad times were not enough, Erzsi is asked in Summer to consider her retirement and pension in the fall, as a teacher singing, just when they were rehearsing the play The Cat by Edward Grieg. Whoever supposes to replace us always proves to be a doubly executioner: firstly by evoking that which we ourselves were in the past, being young, secondly by moving ourselves without even being able to recognize our old age doing what we love the most, not knowing how to be as we were in the past. , nor knowing how to be still as in the past in the present continuous. And the Giza-Erzsi epistolary counterpoint remains, squeezed by time and dilated by words and mental representations like written sheets balled up under the pillow.I said at the beginning, Giza and her sister Erzsi at the beginning? Or should I have said Paula? That's the problem with mazes. If one loses the thread of the occurrence, one can lose track of where we are and who has accompanied us."

His doctor advises him to marry, which he does, but will this solve his problems?\r\n   \r\n\"The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave\" (1971) is a Giallo film, aka Italian psychological crime/thriller with bits of sexploitation, horror and, maybe, the supernatural. Mario Bava’s contemporaneous “A Bay of Blood” is a good example. \r\n\r\nWhile these kinds of movies can be creepy with slasher elements, they’re also sexy (Erika Blanc's coffin dance), perverse (Blanc in panties and thigh-high boots being chased by a guy with a whip), ridiculous (the bloody catfight in the third act) and highly-stylized, not to mention they function as murder mysteries. \r\n\r\nA highlight here is the female cast, including Maria Teresa Toffano (Polly), Blanc (Susie) and Marina Malfatti as new wife, Gladys, not to mention Paola Natale as Evelyn in flashbacks.\r\n\r\nIt’s curious that the story takes place in the London area because it’s clear that it was shot in Italy. Why not just have the story occur in Italy? In any case, if I’m in the mood for colorful Italian horror from the early 70s, I’ll go with “The Devil’s Nightmare,” which also costars Erika Blanc. Yet there’s enough here to entertain if you like Giallo flicks.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes, and was shot at Thiene Castle, which is an hour’s drive northwest of Venice in northeastern Italy, with studio work being done in Rome.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-"

Bill Moseley only gets to walk around like Frankenstein or a zombie without really saying much other than “Laura”. I can’t blame him though, it’s more the script’s fault.

Music is by Giles Packham and cinematography by Darran Tiernan.\r\n\r\nMary (Dickie) and her teenage son, Fergal (Bruton), are being tracked by Cathal (Nesbitt), a man using dark arts to achieve his quest. But why is he after them? Can Mary's own witchcraft skills keep them protected? And how come the Scottish housing estate that is their latest home has suddenly started suffering brutal murders?\r\n\r\nHow nice to find an independant British horror bringing something refreshing to the genre, that of the occult in a modern day housing estate - and a depressingly bleak one at that. McCarthy and his team fill out their picture to a backdrop of urban decay, with narrative splinters involving doomed love, a battle of the black arts and a beastie secret to will out.\r\n\r\nThere's no rushing going on here, pic is purposely paced slowly, the writing giving us important information in increments. We are only given partial anatomy glimpses of what is comitting the bloody carnage. The key characters have interesting stories of themselves, with two fractured family dynamics at work, while the delve into cryptic rituals and arcane magic as a weapon makes for fascinating viewing.\r\n\r\nThe big reveal of the perpretrator is something of a let down, for although we are introduced to a new looking creature, the effects work is not great - leaving us hankering for a less is more approach. But it's a minor itch, with a cast on form (does Nesbitt and Dickie even know how to be rubbish in anything anyway), and the colour filters set at social realism, Outcast is a surprise winner of a horror movie. 7/10"

        "content": "The first beach flick with surprising mindfood minus the goofiness\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1959 and directed by Paul Wendkos, \"Gidget” is a beach drama about a 16 year-old tomboyish girl (Sandra Dee) who gravitates toward a group of surfing males in Southern Cal, specifically Malibu. Kahuna (Cliff Robertson), a surf “bum” and leader of the group, becomes her figurative big brother as she tries to attract the attentions of Kahuna’s mentee, Moondoggie (James Darren).\r\n\r\nThe film is iconic and influential, leading to two sequels and a TV series, not to mention scores of 60’s beach flicks, most inferior because they lack the depth and went the zany route. Dee was only 16 during shooting, but seemed more mature than her years and is remarkably strong as the petite protagonist. She’s a combo of youthful energy, honesty and unexpected insight & understanding. The film scores high marks in the female department in general with curvy Yvonne Craig (aka Batgirl) notable in the first act, but there are several others in the periphery.\r\n\r\nThe movie’s iconic because it’s about way more than girl-meets-boy frolics, although there’s some of that. For instance, Kahuna says \"Who says so?\" in response to how we 'have' to live our lives. Later, he recognizes \"everything has a price\" or, put differently, everything has a tradeoff. He desperately seeks total freedom, but realizes it doesn’t really exist in our present world, but he instinctively seeks it. His epiphany leads to an important decision.\r\n\r\nThen there's Moondoggie who admires Kahuna and intends on following in his footsteps as an alternative to his staunch father's more conventional path to status. Yet it's still about status for Moondoggie and not a lifestyle choice for its own sake, as it supposedly is with Kahuna.\r\n\r\nWhat happens to Flyboy (the pet bird) sets up a weighty conversation between Kahuna and Gidget, which offers insights about Kahuna's past, including his time in the Korean War and how it affected him. Perhaps he was working out a case of PTSD. Five years of dropping out of mainstream life and living on the beach was what he needed to get it out of his system and, by the end of the movie, he seems back for the attack. Steve Jobs, founder of Apple computers, had a chapter in his life of living on the street and doing drugs, asking the big questions, etc. He now says it was an instrumental part of his life.\r\n\r\nEven the whole Kahuna almost having sex with the under-aged Gidget was ballsy for 1959. Kahuna genuinely didn’t intend to, and actually wanted to teach Gidge a lesson, but he wasn’t above doing it since he was a little drunk and she was sorta insisting. Shortly later, Moondoggie reprimands Kahuna for it.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 35 minutes and was shot in Leo Carrillo State Beach, Malibu, California.

        "content": "_**Decent monster movie where the Mothman is linked to Shawnee leader Hokoleskwa (aka Cornstalk)**_\r\n\r\nRELEASED TO TV IN 2010 and directed by Sheldon Wilson, \"Mothman\" details events in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, where a group of friends hide the truth about the death of one of their friends. Years later, when one of the group returns to town (Jewel Staite), a supernatural creature with links to the unjust slaying of Cornstalk in 1777 preys on them due to their guilt of murder. Jerry Leggio plays the old blind man who has interesting insights about the Mothman.\r\n\r\nSome people were disappointed with 2002's \"The Mothman Prophecies\" because it was a mystery/horror film that shot for art and depth (and, in my opinion, succeeded) when what they really wanted was a conventional monster movie. Well, \"Mothman\" quells that desire as it's a straight creature feature. Being a TV flick, though, it only cost $2 million while \"The Mothman Prophecies\" was a theatrical release that cost $32 million eight years earlier. As such, it's no surprise that the latter is the superior production. Yet that doesn't mean \"Mothman\" isn't worth checking out if you appreciate TV-budget monster movies now and then.\r\n\r\nThe prologue where someone inadvertently dies during youthful festivities in the woods is well done, except for elements of the cover-up. There's simply no reason that the teens couldn't have reported the kid simply drowned and they found the body. But it could be argued that they were young, dumb & drunk/high. I was too at one time.\r\n\r\nI liked the whole fictional linkage of the Mothman to Hokoleskwa (aka Cornstalk), which showed imagination in the scripting. Jewel is a worthy female protagonist and I didn't have a problem with the no-name cast who surrounded her (Connor Fox, Jess Sylvia, Susie Abromeit, Michael Aills & Matty Ferraro).\r\n\r\nAs for the cartoony CGI monster, I actually found it kinda scary the first time I watched this movie (back when it originally came out) and even had a nightmare about it, which is something that almost never happens (these types of flicks rarely scare me, but I find them entertaining). Viewing the film again 7.5 years later, the monster isn't quite as effective as I remembered it, perhaps because a similar type of creature was used in the same director's superior \"Scarecrow\" (2013).\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that you shouldn't look to this movie for much accuracy about the Mothman sightings in 1966 Point Pleasant, which culminated in the December 15, 1967, collapse of the Silver Bridge and the death of 46 people. The movie simply uses the Mothman lore as a springboard for its own story.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 91 minutes and was shot in Denham Springs, Louisiana, and points nearby.

Quickly finding that the town is run by the family Agry itself, Buchanan falls foul of one of them straight away. His problems are further compounded when he steps in to stop a young Mexican from taking a beating. Something that finds him on the end of a rope with things looking rather grim.\r\n\r\nHow you fare with Buchanan Rides Alone may depend on how many (if any) Budd Boetticher and Randolph Scott collaborations you have seen prior. For this adaptation of Jonas Ward's novel \"The Name's Buchanan\" is lighter in tone than their other well regarded pieces. Not to decry this as a standalone picture of course, but although it's part of the \"Ranown\" cycle, it's a long way from the more \"Adult Western\" richness of The Tall T, Ride Lonesome and Comanche Station for example. Conversely the other way is also true, if this is the first one you sample from the duo, and you enjoy it, well you may not take to the deeper themed, harsher other films in their cannon.\r\n\r\nBuchanan Rides Alone gets in a does a job without any fuss or boring filler play. Randolph Scott as Buchanan clearly is enjoying adding a bit of comic zip to proceedings, with Boetticher evidently happy to keep things smooth for the one hour and twenty minutes running time. Fine support comes from Barry Kelley, Tol Avery and the irrepressible L.Q. Jones, whilst Lucien Ballard was the obvious and right choice to photograph the Old Tuscon location. Not one to take too seriously, but enough drama to keep one interested, and certainly one that gives notice to what a fine and undervalued performer Randy Scott was. 6.5/10"

Craig Stevens, Manuel Rojas and L.Q. Jones are also on hand.\r\n\r\n\"Buchanan Rides Alone\" (1958) is one of five Westerns from 1956-1960 written by Burt Kennedy, directed by Budd Boetticher and starring Randolph Scott. The others are: “7 Men from now,” “The Tall T,” “Ride Lonesome” and “Comanche Station.” Two additional films omit writer Kennedy from the equation: “Decision at Sundown” and “Westbound.” A little cult has formed around these Westerns and most are first-rate despite some not having the biggest budgets.\r\n\r\nI’ve seen four of ’em and like them all, except this one. It’s based on the first book of the Buchanan paperback series, started by Jonas Ward (aka William Ard) and continued by other authors after his death. Buchanan in print is a happy-go-lucky wanderer in the Old West with a tongue-and-cheek tone. \r\n\r\nThe movie starts off entertaining enough with Scott jovial and confident in a decidedly unfriendly Southwestern town, but the second half devolves into tedious writing with absurd back-and-forth storytelling (he’s captured; he escapes; he’s captured; he escapes), not to mention at least one glaring plot hole in a life-or-death situation.\r\n\r\nJennifer Holden is notable as the lone female, but little is done with her presence. This is a one-dimensional dude flick through and through.\r\n\r\nIt’s not all bad. Like I said, the first half works well enough, there are some amusing scenes/lines, most of the cast is good, the music’s great, and the Arizona locations with saguaro cacti are fine. The bad writing sinks it, however. Kennedy wrote the script based on Ward’s book, but it was lost in translation.   \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in Old Tucson, Arizona, and wilderness parts nearby. \r\n\r\nGRADE: C-"

Having now established a bit of stability for his country, he now tries to hold onto it. He now tries to establish an army to cement his reign whilst his aunt Efrosinia (Serafima Birman) still promotes the interests of her son Vladimir (Pavel Kadochnikov). With the help of the boyars who are also unhappy with his rule, they set about deposing him. Whereas part one was very much more about the rise of Ivan IV, this second episode also focuses a little more on the others, and Kadochnikov performs well as the would-be pretender as does Birman as his scheming mother and his friend \"Philip\" the monk (Andrei Abrikosov) whom he installs as the powerful Metropolitan Archbishop of Moscow. There are plenty of other rich character actors too amongst his soldiers, and some of the darkness and melancholy is replaced - partly by the use of colour intermittently throughout - with a sort of cinematic optimism. Again, the message of Russian (Soviet) unity is writ large, but here we start to see a little more of a benign-ness in the emperor. Sure, he still has his ruthless streak, but he is clearly looking forward more in this; not necessarily to a successor but to a strong and firm bedrock for the future of his country and it's people under his own, divinely inspired, control. The photography is intimate and striking; the facial expressions and wonderful score continue to imbue the characters with personas that no amount of deftly written dialogue could provide. That said, the dialogue is still sparing and effective and the pace moves along in a lively and interesting manner. It looks like an authentic glimpse into 16th century Russian court life, full of intrigues and plotting and I loved it just as much as the first part."

This is a man firmly dangling on the end of the puppet strings being twirled and pulled by his Moll, Flo Becker. Oh he’s not beyond slapping his woman around, or bullying one of his weaker willed accomplices, but Corman and Campbell assure us that Kelly is not to be gloried, even giving him a pathological fear of dying that shows him in this movie form as something of a coward. \r\n\r\nOf course this is just a movie, and for historical facts and figures et al, folks are warned this is not a biography to use as a starting point to explore Kelly’s reputation… \r\n\r\nBronson as Kelly is wonderfully broody and he handles the fluctuations in Kelly’s psyche with convincing skill. Cabot as Flo is a sex-bomb, and deviously appealing with it she is as well, while Amsterdam gets to play a character so colourful and kinked, it wouldn’t be out of place in classic era film noir. Crosby was an ace cinematographer, capable of making the cheapest crime movie production looking a whole lot more expensive, such is the case here. While Fried provides a progressive jazz musical score that ranges from Ant Hill Mob like breeziness to funky piano based frenzies. \r\n\r\nAll in all, a good gangster movie that benefits from some well written and performed characterisations. 7/10"

The cherubic young Dickie Moore in the title role was seven or eight when he made this, and frequently he looks like he awaiting instructions from an off-screen parent before commencing his scene - more often than not with an hugely inappropriate smile, or grin, or both... The rest of the cast do a workmanlike job with this super story; Irving Pichel is quite convincing as the manipulative miser \"Fagin\", as is Sonny Ray with his wobbly hat, as the \"Artful Dodger\" and a suitably sinister William Boyd as the villainous \"Sikes\". Subsequent versions are grittier and darker, offering us a much more malevolent view of London at the very start of the Victorian era, but this has a certain charm to it that makes the brief, quite well (and eerily at times) stitched together, adaptation well worth a gander."

Of course they head to Chicago for their boys own fun, unbeknown to them that the ship they had told their wives they were travelling on has sunk at sea!\r\n\r\nI think this stands the test of time as one of the best Laurel & Hardy pictures because it's one of the most professional that they made. Laurel wasn't wholly satisfied with a couple of preceding features that they did, he felt it was becoming slapstick for slapstick's sake, so in came a new writing team to work with him to give us a tighter character driven laugh fest. \r\n\r\nThe films main triumph is the integration and impact of the wives, they add greatly to the comedy with sparky dialogue and visual madness. So many great moments that I don't wish to point any single one out, you just need to see it and enjoy. The songs are fun, the narrative is as tidy as they would do, and the underlying honesty is the best policy message is one we all should heed. 9/10"

May Robson steals the show as \"Apple Annie\", a lady who makes her living selling these fruit on Times Square. She is well known and well liked by her pals and all is going along nicely until her daughter writes to announce that she will be arriving from Spain with her new fiancée and his father - both are (minor) Spanish aristocracy who have been led to believe, as has her daughter, that \"Annie\" is rather closer to the top of New York society than she actually is! Luckily, up steps local crook \"Dave the Dude\" (Warren William) who has always had a fondness for the old girl, and on hearing of her impending predicament decides that he is going to help. The race is on now on to turn the rough around the edges woman into the epitome of culture and decorum - otherwise, no wedding! It's good fun to watch this - on one hand we have the story or rags to riches (for the day) Robson, and she is engaging and charming in an authentic manner; the other is the gangster whose behaviour is causing all sorts of consternation amongst his colleagues and rivals who are unsure just what is going on... Halliwell Hobbes is always reliable as the butler and Glenda Farrell has some good scenes as \"Missouri\", too. It has a pace all of it's own, and plenty of humour to keep the 90 minutes busy and enjoyable. Of course there is little jeopardy - and the fact that there isn't is actually one of the things that vindicates this actually rather joyous piece of cinema."

It has several of my favourite stars from that era, such as Deborah Kerr, Rita Hayworth, David Niven, Dame Wendy Hiller, Burt Lancaster and Rod Taylor, and their interplay befits such fine casting. It's weird seeing Lancaster and Niven cast as rogues, that a film set in Dorset, England was made entirely in Hollywood and that the screenplay was an amalgamation of two one-act plays by Terence Rattigan, opened up in order to include more stars. The endeavor worked, as Best Adapted Screenplay was one of its seven Oscar nominations (it ended up winning two, for Niven and Hiller's performances). I heartily recommend the film to anyone who enjoys either any of the aforementioned stars or fine films of the era (especially ones about the British, and ones derived from the stage). It'll certainly be 100 minutes worthy of your effort--Mann was one of the best at this sort of thing (also see 'Marty' if you have any such doubts)..."

As the bodies start to pile up and various climbers go missing on the mountain, the United Nations send a boffin to help the local scientists to hopefully solve the mystery.\r\n\r\nThe effects work has been the source of some disdain, and in truth it’s poor but not the worst from the 1950s pantheon of “B” schlockers. The back projection scenes are crude, but again in keeping with the fun aspects of the genre and era. However, Jimmy Sangster’s screenplay is tight and produces brainy conversations and strong sequences. \r\n\r\nHorror comes by way of headless bodies turning up and that once sane people turn into maniacs as “the terror” weaves its magic. On the normal human side the narrative is given a boost by Janet Munro’s (excellent) telepathic darling, something which troubles the visitors greatly and puts her in grave danger. The psychological aspects of the story mark this out as a genre piece of worth.\r\n\r\nElsewhere director Quentin Lawrence does a study job with what is available to him, Forest Tucker is the hero in waiting, playing it reserved like, and Warren Mitchell proves good foil for Tucker and the Terror! It’s not a great film, but it is a good one, let down in some tech departments for sure, but strengths elsewhere make up for its flaws. 7/10"

However, to other beasts of the island he is not so forgiving. For the first 33 minutes it’s all about setting up the action carnage later in the play, characters are introduced, their reasons for being out at sea and etc. Then we get to the island and off we go.

Of course, that's all due from the movie being made in 1934. The entire industry was still figuring out the whole sound thing, and this film is definitely a reminder of that.

Unfortunately his mother, Hester (Hobson), is a spendthrift badly hung up on money as some sort of status symbol, while his father, Richard (Sinclair), is a gambler, and not a good one at that. With Uncle Oscar Creswell (Squire) bailing them out of financial trouble for the last time, the Grahame family are heading for bankruptcy unless income can be found. Befriending the new handyman, Bassett (Mills), Paul is delighted to find that Bassett is an ex-jockey and regales him with tails of horse racing, he even learns from Bassett how to ride his Rocking Horse like a real jockey.

Initially he is thrilled to be able to win lots of money, the house seems to be telling him that his parents must have more money, so aided by Bassett, he is saving the cash to help his frantic mother, who by now has resorted to pawning possessions for cash.

Pic is crammed with sinister imagery. The Rocking Horse itself is up in the attic, which gives the makers perfect opportunities for shadows to enhance the \"unhealthy\" scenes of Paul riding away like a boy possessed, while for the key scene Pelissier uses a depth perception technique that is gloriously disorientating. An ascent by Paul up to the attic is moody magnificence, Hester's visit to the back room Pawnbroker (Charles Goldner) drips with unease, while the finale features a near demonic last shot that literally will be burned into your soul. \r\n\r\nWith top performances from the cast to seal the deal, this tale of a boy and his Rocking Horse gnaws away at the senses as the fallibility of the human condition is frighteningly laid bare. 9/10"

Those two things would, you'd assume, lead to a disappointing follow-up. That's not the case here.\r\n\r\nListen, it most probably doesn't need to exist. However, it still manages to create a followable story that's worth viewing. I didn't massively connect to it but I wasn't underwhelmed by it either. Add to that the strong performance of Scott Bairstow - he may be no Ethan Hawke, but I like what he gives to this. Of the rest of the cast, Al Harrington (Moses) and Charmaine Craig (Lily) are decent.\r\n\r\nGoing back to Hawke, who does appear momentarily at the beginning. The retcon job on his character and therefore the conclusion of the 1991 production is rather substandard. From a film point of view, it makes zero sense. With that said, for the plot it is serviceable - especially with Hawke's cameo to make it feel proper.\r\n\r\nOne understandable negative some may have is the less amount of screen time for White Fang himself. I actually did agree for a large portion while viewing, but by the end I was satisfied with how much I saw of the wolfdog. Did I want more of him? Sure, it's not a deal-breaker for me though.\r\n\r\nDefinitely inferior to the first film, but still a good watch in my opinion."

When one particularly nasty railroad agent tries his strong arm tactics on the mother of the James brothers, he gets more than he bargained for. In an act of almost vengeful negligence, the agent causes the death of Mrs James and thus sets the wheels in motion for what was to become folklore notoriety, Jesse James, his brother Frank, and a gang of seemingly loyal thieves, went on to etch their names in outlaw history.\r\n\r\nThere is no getting away from the fact that history tells us that this is a highly fictionalised account of Jesse James and his exploits. What we are given here by director Henry King and his screenwriter Nunally Johnson, is a more romanticised look at the legend of the man himself; which sure as heck fire makes for one dandy and enjoyable watch. The cast is one to savour, Tyrone Power (Jesse James), Henry Fonda (Frank James), Randolph Scott (Will Wright), Brian Donlevy (Barshee) and John Carradine (Bob Ford) all line up to entertain the masses with fine results, with Fonda possibly owing his subsequent career to his appearance here. He would return a year later in the successful sequel The Return Of Frank James and subsequently go on to greater and more rewarding projects. Power of course would go on and pick up the trusty blade and start swishing away, a career beckoned for this matinée idol for sure, but it's nice to revisit this particular picture to see that Power could indeed be an actor of note, capable of some emotional depth instead of making Jesse just another outlawish thug. If the makers have made the character too \"heroic\" then that's for debate, it's one of the many historical \"itches\" that have irked historians over the years. But Power plays it as such and it works very well. \r\n\r\nOne of the film's main strengths is the pairing of Power and Fonda, very believable as a kinship united in ideals, with both men expertly handled by the reliable Henry King. The Technicolor from Howard Greene and George Barnes is wonderfully put to good use here, splendidly capturing the essence of the time with eye catching results. While the film itself has a fine action quota, gun play and galloping horses all feature throughout, and the characterisations of the main players lend themselves to pulse raising sequences. To leave us with what? A highly accomplished Western picture that ends in the way that history has showed it should, whilst the rest of the film is flimsy history at best... Yes. But ultimately it really doesn't matter if one is after some Western entertainment, because for sure this picture scores high in that regard. 8/10"

When Jesse and Frank James' mother falls foul of land-grabber \"Barshee\" (Brian Donlevy) the two brothers declare war on the railway. In best Robin Hood tradition, Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda hit the trains big style. Never with the aim of harming anyone, nor of stealing anything of sentimental value. They just take cash that Donald Meek (\"McCoy\") and his railroad will have to pay back. Fuelled by enthusiastic local newspaper man \"Maj. Cobb\" (Henry Hull) who tries to portray them as more heroes than bandits, they have quite a degree of success before the army are called in to preside over matters. That irks the decent marshal \"Wright\" (Randolph Scott) who wants a fair trial. Power looks every inch the star in this film, but Fonda is far from his best and, personally, I'd sooner have had Walter Brennan or Arthur Hunnicutt as \"Cobb\". Meek, though, is good as the odious little empire builder who manages, almost singe handedly, to ensure that everyone (including me) takes the side of the James brothers. It's too heavy on the dialogue, indeed there is a real paucity of action for the most part as the colour photography seems to work against any grittiness of the story. It is fine to look at, the costumes etc. all top notch, but the ending sort of sums the whole thing up: the stuff of legend really only superficially dealt with in lieu of box office success."

Looking at it from the outside you would think that the film was lining up to be a soft soap romantic fable, but here the emotion is channelled into a sort of character bravado that is flawed - yet something that makes for a viewing experience that draws you in deep with the finely etched characters. \r\n\r\nThe cast are on fine form. Cary Grant gets to flex his non comedic muscles with great results as Carter, the film relies on Grant to glue the story together which he does with great aplomb. Jean Arthur & Rita Hayworth are the girls in amongst this strongly male orientated story, and it's a testament to both of the ladies ability that they don't get bogged down by all the macho heroism pouring out in the plot. Smart camera work and exciting aerial sequences further up the quality that is dotted within the piece, and were it not for some terribly twee dialogue, Only Angels Have Wings would surely be ranked as a classic of the 1930s. As it is, it's a wonderfully involving film that shows Hawks at his most humane. 8/10"

That creates quite an enjoyable intimacy that, coupled, with quite a quickly paced series of scenarios and a better the average performance from the frequently too aloof Hobson to make for quite a fun 80-odd minutes. Even Olivier manages to shake off some of his traditionally rigid style on occasion, though it's never that far away, before an action packed denouement invoking a ray gun, a destroyer and...

DeMille (aided by others due to illness) and based upon the novel Trouble Shooter, written by Ernest Haycox. It stars Barbara Stanwyck, Joel McCrea, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy, Akim Tamiroff and Lynne Overman. Story is a fictionalised account of the building of the railroad across the American West, encompassing the trials, tribulations and rivalries that formed as history was being made.\r\n\r\n\"The legend of Union Pacific is the drama of a nation, young, tough, prodigal and invincible, conquering with an iron highroad the endless reaches of the West. For the West is America's Empire, and only yesterday Union Pacific was the West\".\r\n\r\nA big production that went down a storm at the box office upon release, Union Pacific, in spite of its overt patriotic bluster, is an entertaining and important part of the Western movie story. Alongside John Ford's Stagecoach, which was released a couple of months previously, DeMille's movie helped take the Western to a new and more adult level. It wouldn't be until the 50's that the Western truly found its mojo, but the influence of both Stagecoach and Union Pacific was firmly felt through each passing decade. \r\n\r\nFilm manages to be literate whilst puncturing the plot with doses of action, the story underpinned by a love triangle between McCrea, Stanwyck and Preston. The former as the stoic troubleshooter brought in to keep order, the latter as the charming villain with a heart. Cast all work well with the material to hand, and if one is not bothered by the historical tampering involved in the story? Then it's an easy film to recommend to Western movie seekers. 7/10"

What now ensues is a series of adventures that cause the boy to grow up quickly - and sometimes quite harshly. It's one of those films that rather glorifies the Raj and objectifies the local population, but having been filmed on the private reserve of the Maharajah of Mysore, the photography and authenticity of the story helps give it extra credence that, perhaps, the rather banal dialogue compromises. Sabu used to be the Maharajah's stable boy, so if nothing else the film serves as an excellent springboard for this charming and engaging young actor to get to Hollywood. Interestingly ironic that is was nominated for the \"Mussolini Cup\" in 1937.... I would not call this an exciting film to watch but it is - of it's time - an interesting one."

Anyone who reads the bard's work will realise that the \"Fool\" is always a crucial character for the narrative and the humour. \"Touchstone\" (played here competently by Mackenzie Ward) seems to be on the clock the whole time. His lines are delivered pell mell without leaving us the chance to absorb the wit, subtlety - and the information - contained in his lines. This really starves us of much of the nuance and fun, frankly, of the piece. What we are left with is Olivier being, well, Olivier - big eyes and grand gestures with pitch perfect delivery and all the emotion of a coal sack; and Felix Aylmer taking the imperious role of \"Frederick\" from the stage and making no real effort to adapt it at all for the cinema. The production whistles along with fine attention to the costumes and sets and I did quite like the epilogue - but that may have just been relief. A bit like \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" - some things belong on the medium for which they were originally conceived. This, I'd say, is one such example."

The intervention of the young man's father (Lionel Barrymore), puts a fly in this ointment - he pleads with her not to toy with his son's affections, nor to tarnish his reputation - and she returns to her old beau and his chequebook... It's the ultimate menage-à-trois. The witty and popular woman having to face the grim choice of a loveless relationship, or a penniless one... Cukor sets a high standard; he allows the story to evolve slowly and delicately. The production looks great with wonderful attention to detail, and there is a chemistry between Garbo and the very young Taylor that is quite enthralling. Needless to say, Daniell is his usual dastardly self as the Baron, and Jessie Ralph also detersives notices as \"Nanine\".

There is no disguising the strong accent of the former, nor the drawl of the latter. and there is virtually no chemistry between them - particularly as the story evolves and the precarious nature of Mary's grip on power becomes evident. John Ford creates an image that uses the sets and interiors to convey the rather basic existence of both the Scottish court and of the country in general, but that's about all I can say in it's defence.

Indian chief Surat Khan (C. Henry Gordon) is plotting to sever his ties with the British and pitch his lot in with the Russians in readiness for a total revolt against the Empire. Khan oversees a sneaky bloody massacre of British troops that also see the slaughter of innocent women and children. Pumped up with revenge, Major Vickers (a dashing Errol Flynn) decides to take matters into his own hands and leads a brave charge on the Russians at Balaclava Heights which is where Khan has fled into hiding.\r\n\r\nThat's all you need to know as regards the plot, there is a love tryst sub-plot between Vickers, his brother Perry (Patric Knowles) and Elsa Campbell (a radiant Olivia de Havilland), but this is merely a side issue to add impetus to the bravery of the men in the charge. It's a rousing picture that provides a quite breath taking final reel as the charge is brought vividly to life by director Michael Curtiz.\r\n\r\nSadly many horses and a stuntman were killed during the shooting of the famous charge, the then legal use of trip wires to impact falling horses taking its toll with very tragic results. The practice was brought into the public eye the following year as congress raised the issue about the treatment of animals in motion pictures, thankfully the practice has long since been outlawed. A bit of a sad taint to the film for sure, but it was a golden age for cinema and nobody was doing anything deemed illegal at the time, and lets not hide the fact that the result is truly dynamite. 8/10"

But Meagan Follows and the Canadian production from the 1980s cast a long shadow, and this movie can’t quite emerge from under it.\r\n\r\nI don’t know  whether it was to hold to the very short run time of 78 minutes, or if it was just ti keep the plot simpler, but I think the decision to combine the Rachel Lynde and Diana Berry characters was an unfortunate move. The woman had almost nothing in common, both contributed to the stories in their separate ways, so the plot lost some of its depth in the process. The ending came in a rush, as though the director had his thumb on the fast forward button. Every adaptation of a book or whatever make their own changes and usually I am fine with that. This time: not so much."

Montgomery's original book - not least that \"Anne\" is quite a lot older, but that doesn't really matter as Anne Shirley finds herself adopted by the kindly \"Matthew\" (O.P. Heggie) and his outwardly curmudgeonly sister \"Marilla\" (Helen Westley) at Green Gables - despite the fact that they really wanted a boy. The story depicts her adolescent years as she grows to womanhood, discovering her true love \"Gilbert Blythe\" (Tom Brown) along the way. The script is very wordy, and at times trips over itself; but Shirley and Westley deliver well paced, characterful and often lightly comedic performances with this gentle coming-of-age story that sees both children and adults mature in their own way. It's simple story well executed and equally well worth a watch if your faith in human nature needs a little shoring up."

The chemistry between the two of them is great. She treats him appallingly, yet like a doting puppy he comes back for more each time.

        "content": "Early on in Of Human Bondage Philip Carey (Leslie Howard) is told “You will never be anything but mediocre.” Soon after, Mildred Rogers is described as “anemic … ill-natured and contemptible.” Neither will ever do anything to disprove these assessments. Carey especially will never be able to overcome his weakness; he was literally born with a clubfoot, but his real problem is that he never develops a figurative spine. We leave the film convinced that, had Mildred not died, Carey would have kept taking her back in at the expense of far worthier women – worthier than Mildred, yes, but worthier than him as well.\r\n\r\nNow, as mediocre and contemptible as Carey and Mildred are – and they take mediocrity and contempt to heights, or rather lows, that arguably have yet to be matched almost a century later –, there is a sort of astronomical fascination in watching them follow their preordained trajectories; they’re like heavenly bodies fixed in their orbits, she a star going supernova and he a barren planet becoming engulfed in the ensuing blast.\r\n\r\nBondage is a mixed bag to say the least for Howard, even if Philip Carey isn’t – though not by much either – the most thankless role in his career; five years later he would go on to play the equally insipid Ashley Wilkes in Gone with the Wind, opposite two other legends in the same league as Davis. \r\n\r\nI will say a couple of things for the Carey character, though; number one, he’s fun to watch, not because of what Howard does with it (which is, wisely as it turns out, next to nothing), but because of what goes on in his febrile mind – i.e., his obsession with Mildred, whom he sees everywhere when awake and dreams about when asleep, and which the film manifests through some very neat optical effects (my favorite is a classroom skeleton that takes on Mildred’s likeness, in what may be construed as a bit of reverse foreshadowing). And number two, Howard’s pale shadow of a man makes Davis look even better than she already does – which is a lot –, not that she really needs the help. \r\n\r\nBeautiful though she was, Davis always had a gift for the grotesque (which reached its zenith in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?), and with Mildred she has no trouble conveying, through her faux ingénue façade, the character’s inner moral corruption and physical decay; of particular note is her climactic The Reason You Suck Speech to Carey (and even then it’s hard to sympathize with him, since most if not all the s--- that she calls him on is pretty much true)."

        "content": "Over their storied career, the Coen Brothers have made some of the most original, most iconoclastic, and most critically-acclaimed films of all time. They've tackled adaptations (No Country for Old Men, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) and remakes (The Ladykillers) before, of course, but even these films have borne the brothers' unmistakable mark of originality, their skewed vision of the world, and their cynical, sarcastic sense of humor.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, to make of True Grit?\r\n\r\nIt's termed a re-adaptation of the original Charles Portis novel, a \"re-imagining,\" in the parlance of our time. One is hardly able to discuss the film without the spectre of John Wayne, however: the best-known adaptation of the book was one of the film legend's definitive roles, one of those cultural touchstones that rarely if ever are engineered. Discussion of that film invariably centers on Wayne and his performance: a washed-up, forgotten cowpoke that seemed tailor-made for Wayne to draw on his position at the time. A direct predecessor of Mickey Rourke and The Wrestler.\r\n\r\nI'll admit that it was the Coens' pedigree that moved me to see this film. I've by nature little interest in Westerns, but despite producing a few lesser films (I'm looking at you, Burn After Reading), the Coens' sheer talent, along with the casting of Jeff Bridges in the John Wayne role, had me intrigued.\r\n\r\nThe story is simple and straightforward: The father of young Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is murdered by a two-bit criminal (Josh Brolin), and she takes it upon herself to see him brought to justice. To that end, she hires a reputedly ferocious US Marshal named Rueben \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), while a prideful Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) tags along, hoping to bring the perpetrator to justice for a big reward.\r\n\r\nAnd that's it, really. Completely absent is the trademark Coen plotting, convoluted subplots that twist and turn over onto themselves as though the script were one enormous Möbius strip (Möbius script?). Gone are the defiance of genre definitions, the satirical take on stories, the feeling of the brothers Coen peering through the camera lens at their subjects as though they're studying specimens in a jar. This is straightforward filmmaking, telling a simple tale with all the incredible talent and creative power the Coens command.\r\n\r\nSo what's not missing, then, are the richness of character, impeccable performances, beautiful cinematography and arresting score that are the other hallmarks of a Coen film. Attention is naturally centered on Jeff Bridges, having the audacity to take on one of the defining performances of one of the most famous actors ever. Bridges doesn't attempt to mimic Wayne. He crawls into this character and wears him like a suit. A hairy, shaggy, smelly suit. But Bridges inverts the typical presentation of such a character: instead of offering the audience with a cold, unfeeling badass whose heart is gradually thawed by the presence of a precocious youngster, this Cogburn is introduced as a shiftless layabout with a reputation who seems to have all but given up on such activities in favor of sleeping and boozing, the events of the film conspiring to scrape away that useless crust to reveal the force of nature beneath. Matt Damon, an actor who's never been in a Coens film before but seems as though he should have, also offers a great performance as the proud and buffoonish Texas Ranger LeBeouf, as do Barry Pepper and Josh Brolin in their short but effective appearances as heavies.\r\n\r\nBut the yeoman's work lies not on Bridges' grimy, slouched shoulders. Instead, our focus is on fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross, and the performance given by fourteen-year-old Hailee Steinfeld is, in short, one-of-if-not-the finest performance I've seen in quite a long time. Not content with giving such an incredible performance as a young teenager, this is, to boot, Steinfeld's first film performance. Steinfeld's Mattie Ross is smart, wily, mature, childish, scared, brave, and a force of nature in her own right. She has been wronged, she will see that wrong redressed, and nothing will stand in her way. An early scene in which she negotiates with a trader for horses and money is not only hilarious but revealing, one of the best character introductions in film history.\r\n\r\nSuch an unexpectedly straightforward film from the Coens deserves an equally straightforward judgment: I truly loved this film. There is so much greatness contained within it, from the powerhouse performances of Bridges and Steinfeld to the dark, touching, hilarious script, to Roger Deakins' breathtaking cinematography, to Carter Burwell's haunting score comprised of reorchestrations of classic hymns. It's one of the most perfect films I've ever seen. This is the second fantastic remake I've seen this year, the second to eclipse the original (the first being the superlative Let Me In). If you're wondering whether or not to see this film, wait no longer: go immediately to your nearest theater and buy a ticket. Speaking for myself: I can't wait to see it again."

There was an epilogue on the end which was a tad more sad, but certainly not misplaced, than in the original film.\n\nI have to say that the film it was very good. Jeff Bridges was doing an excellent interpretation of Rooster Gogburn. I found him to be quite “John Wayne like” in this film which is perhaps why I liked it so much."

Powell and Pressburger have elicited the help of the supremely talented Christopher Challis and of the late Jacques Offenbach and basically filmed an augmented theatrical production of his eponymous, uncompleted, opera. They have assembled a curiously effective collection of gloriously clad acting talent - most of whom, aside from the narrator/composer himself in the form of Robert Rounseville, cannot actually sing - and proceeded to present us with something that is really quite beautiful to watch and listen to; but that is really not that different from that which we might see at Covent Garden. It features the landmark P&P colour schemes - vibrant, lively and bold with the use of light and the staging of this three part story all adding up to a delightful watch. If you know the libretto, then you will know this is about a rather down-in-the-dumps poet who is reflecting on his life and the choices his chosen career has forced him to make at the expense of his loves. The ballet dancer \"Stella\" (Moira Shearer) is his most recent love, but there have been others and all of them have, in some way, fallen foul of Robert Helpmann's excellent \"Lindorf\". There are some super puppetry effects and the sparing use of visual effects to remind us were are not in the grand circle, but for the most part this is a cleverly crafted and stylishly produced theatrical performance that I enjoyed, but would still have rather seen (and heard on a stage). It's still innovative and imaginative cinema that is well worth seeing, though."

It's not a great film, this, no - the plot is an hybrid of loads of other stories, but the cast are clearly having fun here and I found it rather contagious. There are intrigues a-plenty, with plenty of arrows whistling about and a gently simmering romance with \"Maryam\" (Cécile Aubry) keeping it ticking over too. It is far, far, too long - indeed at times it comes across as just a bit too episodic but there is a degree of entertaining chemistry between Power and Hawkins and a solid supporting cast of familiar faces to keep the swash buckling. Henry Hathaway does manage to get everyone pulling in the same direction, it's a colourful and jolly romp through English history with some Oscar winning costume design, a jolly score from Richard Addinsell and messy and derivative as it is, I still rather enjoyed it."

        "content": "Clint Eastwood has once again proved himself to be a formidable director. The style and structure of storytelling used in Hereafter will not appeal to a large audience, but something tells me he knew this all too well but honestly, didn't care and rightfully so. Because let's face it, he can afford it and it's certainly a privilege he has earned. And with Hereafter, it seems that all Mr. Eastwood wants to do is share a story. A very beautiful one at that.\r\n\r\nHereafter is divided into three story lines, spread over three different countries. We have Matt Damon as a reluctant psychic in the United States, Cécile De France who plays a journalist in France and a young pair of twin brothers (Frankie and George McLaren) in England. All of these peoples' lives are in one way or another affected by different aspects of death, whether that be a near-death experience or the passing of someone very dear. Or, in Damons case, the ability to establish a certain connection with those who are no longer with us. Eastwood has decided on a particularly art house-like approach, which, like I mentioned earlier, will certainly back off a large amount of potential viewers. However, I personally very much appreciate his decision. He has obviously chosen not to make this some big, hyped-up monster movie about all things paranormal. Instead, Hereafter deals with its subject with great integrity and subtlety. Although, despite said subtlety, it features a few moments which are, by contrast, incredibly intense and shocking (in a non-scary way). In fact, I would even go so far as to say it is not for the faint of heart, but I mean that mostly in an emotional sense, rather than a spectacular one. On a side note, I would actually not recommend this film to anyone who has, in any way, shape or form been confronted with the 2004 tsunami, or even the London terrorist attacks. It might be really confronting, so be advised.\r\n\r\nI personally think the film's user rating is a bit low, but on the other hand I do somewhat understand why this film has not received the appreciation it deserves. Simply put, not everyone (actually, many people) will not understand it. It is a small story, for a small audience. Also, anyone watching this because they think it's all about Matt Damon will be somewhat deceived. I fully understand why they put his name and picture on the poster, since he is the only big name on the payroll. But this is really not 'his' film, he just plays a part in it. And he does it well, but the rest of the cast actually deserves a great deal of credit, because they are quite simply phenomenal. And I mean *all* of them. Cécile de France is really impressive, she plays her part with great dignity and empathy. She truly carries every scene she's in, and she will definitely do her country proud. Personally, I was most affected (both story- and acting wise) by the 'London segment' of the film. The story of the two young brothers is absolutely heartbreaking, and the McLaren boys do a superb job at translating this onto the screen. Anyone who doesn't at least feel a shudder of emotion when watching their story unfold, well... honestly doesn't have a lot of heart. I refuse to give away any plot points at all, other than what I already have. This is really the kind of story you just need to surrender to in order to really appreciate it. The pacing demands some patience, but if this is your kind of film it really won't be too much trouble and you will be greatly rewarded.\r\n\r\nThe way the story unfolds (the three-way structure, which doesn't come together until the very end), inevitably evokes comparison to 'Babel', but honestly, that one cost me a far greater deal of effort to sit through than Hereafter. But that is entirely personal of course, and the structure is really the only similarity between the two; the stories are completely different. And I also think Hereafter is actually far more accessible than Babel, despite its subject matter. The stories are told with such tenderness that it didn't actually bother me at all that they were three separate stories which, until the end, had nothing to do with each other. They all intrigued me in their own personal way.\r\n\r\nActually, I could go on and on...\r\n\r\nIt's been a long time since a film has really touched my heart, but this one has. I've been thinking about what rating I should give it, but honestly, I can't think of a single reason why I wouldn't give this film a 10. Hereafter is a film of true beauty, a real gem. Which, unfortunately, won't be understood by many people, but who knows... Perhaps someday, its time will come.\r\n_(August 2011)_"

The animal kingdom, a hierarchical group of biological creatures that zoologically determine species that are predacious by nature or hunted down by those stronger than them. It is the laws of nature, Darwinism, that the mighty feed on the weak. Natural selection. We, specifically as human apex predators, do what we must in order to increase our survivability odds. For the Cody family, a familial crime syndicate based in Melbourne, that results in suppressing even the most friendly of noises. Their successful drug-distribution has enabled them to purchase a myriad of luxuries in life, including a quaint abode where seventeen year-old Josh stays after his mother overdoses on heroin. With no alternative shelter, he nestles into the heart of the Cody family tree, commanded by the sweet innocent matriarch who’d do anything and everything to see her boys home and safe.\r\n\r\nMichôd based this fictitious story on the Pettingill family, where a pair of brothers were acquitted for slaughtering two police officers at point blank range. Offering an apt yet palpable string of tension that questions the utilisation of firearms, a measure to prevent anarchy not commence it, and the lengths a family will partake in for the sake of hereditary aggregation. His screenplay is smart, boasting a range of unexpectedly intelligent character choices that defy typical tropes within other comparative gangster features. If a main character bravely meets their early demise, it’s executed with no padding or fuss. Bang! Suddenly, Michôd moves on. An irrefutably powerful and perceptible technique that accompanied the meticulously concise script that he had written.\r\n\r\nThe Cody family members are developed substantially, with their affection for each other explicitly displayed for added finesse. The line between psychopathy and scrupulous behaviour is depicted through the character of “Pope”. His outrageous criminal activity tests the loyalty of his brothers whilst embedding a commanding presence within the family. We may view the shenanigans through Josh’s innocent perspective, yet somehow Michôd transforms these detestable characters into, well, protagonists. His attentive detail in illustrating the affectionate bonds within the family, instantly adds a light touch of self-justification for their crimes. Impeccably clever, to turn a group of murderous individuals into something more affable.\r\n\r\nNone of this though would’ve been possible without the sensational performances all-round, with three highlights in particular. Mendelsohn showed the world how brutal his antagonistic capabilities can be, with an arresting performance that cemented his talents almost immediately. Pearce, portraying the “good cop” by convincing Josh not to become a criminal, balances the ethical and moral dilemmas that the main character encounters with a soothingly calm performance. Then Weaver, capitalising on her sweet demeanour, venomously encourages the family through her captivating matriarchal performance. The Brando of Melbourne, perhaps?\r\n\r\nFrecheville lacked emotional conviction, mostly offering a monotonously one-dimensional approach, that forced his uncles to be more enticing as individuals. Occasionally Doolan’s sublime editing consequently resulted in the script feeling somewhat scattershot, particularly in the second act, where the tension dissipated after the shopping centre scene. The introduction of the family’s barrister before the court hearing was also spontaneous, resulting in Phillips’ performance being less than impressive.\r\n\r\nStill, Animal Kingdom is quite simply one of Australia’s greatest exports. Tight, taut and packed full of explosive performances that provide an animalistic bite to this crime story. A rejuvenated modern-take on the classic gangster formula."

It's good, it has an interesting history, but it's lukewarm and uncomfortable, and there's not much to arouse our sympathy. I've seen a lot of films, I'm not sure if this was the first Australian film I saw, but it was certainly the first Australian film that I knew was Australian at the time I was watching it. Inspired by a real-life situation, the film creates a story in which the police seek to capture the members of a family well immersed in Melbourne's criminality. To achieve this, they seek the help of the most balanced person in that family: a young teenager.\r\n\r\nThe movie is good, the script is well written, and it has a lot of very good twists, but it's not a nice or pleasant movie. The characters are very harsh and unsympathetic, and violence and crime are a significant part of their lives, in a way that seems, almost, like a “family business”, proudly transmitted. Josh, the protagonist, is perhaps the one who will better move our sympathy, even though he is too introverted to create good chemistry with the audience. Even the police, with their brutality and cruelty, are far from being the heroes, with only a very thin distance that differentiates them from the bandits.\r\n\r\nI liked the performance of Ben Mendelsohn, who gave life to the most brutal and dominant member of that family, a man that the police themselves seem to have sworn to death, and who doesn't think twice if he has to kill. Jacki Weaver is equally powerful and very good at playing the matriarch of the family, a woman who seems proud of her children's criminal record and will stop at nothing to protect them, no matter what they do. It was no accident that she was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Also, Guy Pearce met the proposed challenge and gave an excellent performance in the role of a conventional police detective. The film also has good dramatic work by Joel Edgerton, James Frecheville and Sullivan Stapleton.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it's a discreet film, which bets more on a strong script and a good work by the cast than, properly speaking, on any kind of visual or artistic device. More than a visual work, this film seeks to tell a story – a rough, uncomfortable, sad and acidic story, but well written and intense. The cinematography is regular, the editing too, the sets and costumes are what you would expect to find here. The special, visual and sound effects used are discreet but functional."

One week in the lives of the pilots of a Royal Flying Corps squadron is chronicled as they struggle with the stresses & risks intrinsic to their profession. Malcolm McDowell plays the Major, Christopher Plummer the Captain and Simon Ward an anxiety-stricken colleague.  \r\n\r\n\"Aces High\" (1976) came out a decade after the exceptional “The Blue Max” (1966) with the former addressing British pilots and the latter Germans. While “Blue Max” is all-around superior and more epic, “Aces High” ain’t no slouch. It successfully brings you back in time to see what it was like for men in the brand new profession of fighter piloting. This is a “man’s movie” in the manner of, say, “Lawrence of Arabia” (1962), but a few females show up in the last act. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes, and was shot in England (Buckinghamshire, Essex & Eton College with studio work done in Hertfordshire).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

        "content": "Perhaps because many of the cast here all look so very young, this film has an extra potency as a depiction of some of the inexperienced fliers who fought in the Great War. It all centres around the young \"Crawford\" (Simon Ward) who joins a squadron commanded by \"Gresham\" (Malcolm McDowell) and his adjutant \"Sinclair\" (Christopher Plummer). Green in the extreme, he finds himself fighting for his life every time he is airborne, and he must also balance the increasingly delicate needs of his commander who must deal, on a daily basis, with the mounting death toll amongst his Royal Flying Corps airmen. Jack Gold manages to capture well the sense of foreboding and the nerve-end existence of these youngsters as well as offering us some spectacular aerial photography and combat scenes that give us an authentic looking experience of just how perilous their lives were and just how flimsy their aircraft were, too. McDowell overacts a bit, almost as much as Plummer under-delivers - neither here quite hit the spot, but Ward and Peter Firth's \"Croft\" do, and their efforts are convincing. Time hasn't really been so kind to this production, but forty years later it still offers a plausible glimpse into the dangers in the lives of young men who had barely learnt to shave. No, it's not the \"Blue Max\" (1966) but it isn't a bad attempt at telling a similar story."

This is based on a true story, btw, and we see the two brothers by the credits (lovely idea, and also shows us how true the actors are to the real brothers).\r\n\r\nThe story is centered around Micky, but we also get a lot of insight into his crazy family, which consists of a mad and devoted mother (Melissa Leo), a hundred sisters and of course, the father who is just trying to survive in the ocean of women. They all mean well, but damn, I am glad my family is different from them. \r\n\r\nI've never (big word in this case, but still) been a big David O. Russell fan. His movies has been a little too... fancy for my liking, and with a weird sense of humor (seriously, I've never understood what why everyone liked Silver Linings Playbook). However, this one really took me by the heart and flipped me around. It is a very emotional story, and the fact that it's a true story, only makes it so much better. Also, the actors are great, especially the two brothers, Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. They have enough contrasts between them to make it really interesting.\r\n\r\n_Last words... forget the boxing matches. They are ok, but its the story between the brothers that is the real story here. I mean... that last scene with the two being interviewed... that got me so bad.

The film follows a man who is made to go through an 8-minute window repeatedly to locate the person responsible for a train bombing. As the loop repeats, the plot thickens. It's a pretty good film which keeps you at the edge of the seat and reveals to you in stages as to what is going on. The cast has done a good job portraying their roles.

Several jocks have freaked out after seeing the apparition and subsequently went into a coma. The school enlists the services of the Veritas Project, a team of investigators who work undercover to unravel paranormal phenomena. They’re like the family version of Mulder & Scully from The X-Files.  David Keith plays the father, Mel Harris the mother and the teen twins are played by Leighton Meester and Douglas Smith. The dad pretends to be a janitor at the school while the kids act as new students.\r\n\r\nTo enjoy this movie you have to accept the highly unlikely premise of a family team of investigators and the fact that this is a tame horror movie from an author who’s writes Christian supernatural fiction with this movie being geared toward youths (tweens, teens & pre-teens). You also have to accept that, while the movie had a limited theatrical release, it had the budget of a TV movie ($2 million) and it shows. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, there are several things to appreciate about “Hangman’s Curse”: The cast is likable, formidably headed by Keith; for once in a high school flick we get students who actually LOOK like they’re in high school, rather than mid-20s; I like the forbidden wing of the school and its subterranean burrows (reminiscent of the boiler room sequences in the Nightmare on Elm Street flicks); there are loads of creepy arachnids; and there are some quality cuts on the soundtrack.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, the acting of the peripheral teens is understandably weak and the convoluted story could’ve been relayed in a clearer, more compelling manner.\r\n\r\nAs far as the Christian-oriented content goes, it’s so light that I can hardly see how anyone would be offended. For instance, a group prays before their meal. Woo, like that doesn’t happen every day in every community throughout the Americas. Since the protagonists are Christians, it makes sense to portray them accordingly. If anything, the movie plays it too low-key in this regard.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes and was shot in Spokane, Washington.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+"

On the morning of the big day, however, Liv begins to notice strange events unfolding on the ground level of her apartment building. When Liv and her best friend Thomas venture downstairs to get to the bottom of the mystery, they discover an aged photograph of two girls and a cat. Suddenly, the cat comes bounding out of the photograph, prompting young Liv to fall unconscious. Upon awakening in a nearby hospital, Liv is told by a doctor that she suffered a mild asthma attack. But Liv knows that wasn't the case, and quickly becomes convinced that the strange occurrences of late are inexorably tied to that bizarre photograph. But when Thomas returns to find the photograph, it is nowhere to be found. Later, Liv and Thomas discover a secret storeroom. Every time Liv touches something in the storeroom, she experiences a brief but incredibly vivid vision. Could it be that someone is trying to tell Liv something, and are these events tied to a strange catastrophe that unfolded on these same grounds nearly one hundred years ago? Despite the fact that few adults seem to believe her incredible story, an elderly neighbor living upstairs may just have the information that will allow Liv and Thomas to unlock the truth behind the strange events unfolding all around them."

It was a low cost film, but production was good. The opening was decent, so expected a fine development and conclusion. Then did I disappointed with it? Well, a little!\r\n\r\nIt got me. At one point I predicted it entirely wrong. I realised that only during the final few minutes. Yep, the actors were good and so the fairly fitting ending, but for some people that might look like a grand twist. I think the writing, including dialogues and direction was better than I expected. Feels like it is an ordinary version of 'Ruby Sparks'. If you had liked that, probably you would like it as well, though it is not a fantasy.\r\n\r\nWhatever you thought of it, the last 5-10 minutes makes you change your stance, that's how it is designed. So it is not a best romance-comedy, but a watchable one for being slightly original. I would surely give a thumbs up to you to go for it, only if you say you won't try to predict it, but try to watch it like the normal people. In my opinion, that's how it to be watched for the maximum benefit.\r\n\r\n6/10"

As he’s away on business, his girlfriend (Catherine Hicks) gives his nerdy 15 year-old daughter (Ami Dolenz) a makeover. When the dad returns home his daughter is no longer a girl, but a blossoming woman who’s attracting males left and right. Wallace Shawn plays a successful psychologist.\r\n\r\n\"She’s Out of Control\" (1989) is a coming of age dramedy that pokes fun at several things: The loving father who’s overly concerned about his daughter’s honor, a girl’s discovery of her womanly powers, self-help authors who supposedly have everything figured out, and the challenging relationship between the daughter’s boyfriend and her father . \r\n\r\nThe title isn’t “false advertising” because everything’s told from the perspective of the protagonist, which is Danza’s character. To HIM, she is out of control. Speaking of Danza, he has John Ritter’s likable charm and easily carries the movie. \r\n\r\nDolenz was 18 during shooting and is serviceable as the title character, but she got better in such roles as she aged, as witnessed in “Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings” (1993). The film would’ve been more successful if they casted a more iconic 80’s actress in the role (although I’m glad Molly Ringwald didn’t play the part, probably because she was too old by 1988 when the film was shot). On the other side of the gender spectrum, Dana Ashbrook stands out as rockin’ loner Joey.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I was interested in seeing this flick was because Siskel & Ebert tore it to pieces on their show. Gene even said he considered quitting his job because of it. Seriously? It’s a cute high school comedy focusing on a father’s amusing travails, not frickin’ “Gandhi.” Meanwhile, in Ebert’s review, he laughably psychoanalyzed the dad’s attitude toward his daughter as “perverse,” “sick” and “sexual.” Really? All movies exaggerate reality to some degree, especially farces like this one. ALL fathers of nubile daughters can relate to his situation to some degree, even though it’s amusingly EXAGGERATED.  \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena, Malibu, Huntington Park, Downey, Oxnard and Hollywood).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

Christopher George plays the lieutenant in charge of the investigation while Lynda Day George is on hand as a tennis instructor.\r\n\r\n“Pieces” (1982) borrows components of previous slashers, like “Psycho” (1960), “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974) and the first two “Friday the 13th” movies (1980-1981), but places the story at a Massachusetts university. Yet this is actually a Euro-horror flick shot in Madrid with some exteriors from Boston. Unlike “Halloween” (1978) and “Friday the 13th,” which were state-of-the art at the time and therefore have a timeless quality despite the obsolete fashions, “Pieces” is dated and feels like an early-to-mid 70’s flick. The ambient score, which is reminiscent of “The Warriors” (1979), and an outdated rock track contribute to this vibe.    \r\n\r\nThis is a Whodunit with a killer that dresses like The Shadow and prefers a chainsaw. The idea that a person can inconspicuously move about a campus in such peculiar apparel while lugging around a freakin’ chainsaw is unlikely to say the least. Another amusing quirk is when a curious Kung Fu instructor suddenly appears and just as quickly disappears.\r\n\r\nIf you can laugh with these hitches, along with the dubbing, “Pieces” is actually a serious murder mystery with a thought-out story, a decent cast, convincing gore and a good eye for women, such as the aerobics instructor and student.   \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 25 minutes. The Spanish title is “Mil gritos tiene la noche,” which translates as “One Thousand Screams in the Night.”\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

Gaylen Ross (as Alexis Dubin) from “Dawn of the Dead” (1978) appears as one of the protagonists. \r\n\r\nSeeing “Madman” (1981) makes you realize the excellence of “Friday the 13th” (1980). It has the same basic setting and plot with a promising opening that borrows from “The Fog” (1980), not to mention a crazy ax-wielding killer that recalls “The Shining” (1980). But it never rises above a flat experience, although it has some nice nocturnal camp mood. \r\n\r\nThe fact that everything takes place within a few hours on the same night doesn’t help because there are no daytime scenes; and so the story’s just too one-dimensional for a movie that runs almost an hour and a half. Some dull scenes unnecessarily drag on and could’ve been cut in half. Another negatory is that the director/writer has no eye for capturing women on film; and I’m not talking about nudity or sleaze. \r\n\r\nStill, if you favor the “Friday the 13th” flicks and don’t mind a subpar copy, “Madman” should fill the bill, although that’s about it. At least the titular character’s make-up is well done. He’s sort of like Bigfoot if he were human and liked axes.    \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 28 minutes, and was shot entirely at Fish Cove Inn, Southampton, Long Island, New York.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C/C-"

Yet when you view something like Peter Hall's Never Talk to Strangers it rams home just how welcome it is to have Hitch like thrillers at least done well!\r\n\r\nRebecca De Mornay is a troubled shrink who whilst dealing with the mind games of a serial killing loony (Harry Dean Stanton), meets sexually charged Latino guy (Antonio Banderas) and indulges in passions unbound. Then she starts to get very unwelcome presents in the post...\r\n\r\nThe erotic thriller has been well trodden, and will continue to be so for sure, so it feels a little churlish to decry Hall's movie for coming off as a weak willed imitator of previous purveyors of the sub-genre, but this blend of Silence of the Lambs meets Sea of Love - cum - Dressed to Kill - cum Fatal Attraction etc etc just comes across as a cheat. And that's because it is!\r\n\r\nThe makers know this and try to hide their ridiculous folly behind eroticism as the two lovely looking headlining stars get sweaty and wet, indulging in sexual play that's as powerful as the surroundings (Banderas lives in a loft apartment resplendent with metal cage and wrought iron doors). But, or should that be butt? The mystery element is weak, the suspense equally so, while the back story of De Mornay's father (a key character) is hopelessly under developed.\r\n\r\nThen there is H.D. Stanton, stealing every scene is he is in, quid pro quo indeed, yet he's hardly in the film, which ultimately proves to be a tragedy as the plot hurtles towards its implausible and risible revelations. Red herrings come and go as quickly as Becca and Tony's underwear (the continuity editor should have been sacked along with the writers because of one scene BTW), and even though Pino Donaggio scores the music with customary swirling qualities, this just comes off as a piggyback tactic...\r\n\r\nThis is a poor thriller in spite of two very committed and visually attractive perfs from the leads - and of course Stanton's knowingly sleazy turn. Seek this out only if you think Body of Evidence is in the upper echelons of erotic thrillers. 5/10"

It stars Ray Milland, Ann Todd, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Leo Carroll. Music is scored by William Alwyn & Victor Young and cinematography by Max Green. \r\n\r\n\"This is a true story...one of the strangest chapters in the annals of crime. Its characters lived more than fifty years ago...the leading figures in a passionate game of love and murder. It began on a sailing vessel homeward bound from the West Indies for Liverpool....\" \r\n\r\nLewis Allen's movie falls into that category of films tagged as Gaslight Noir – Period Noir. Marjorie Bowen's literary works were always ripe for such noirish period pickings, given that many of them feature dark doings, bad people, idiotic people and just plain misery, and this filmic adaptation is no different in that respect; gloriously so for the film noir faithful. \r\n\r\nWhile not in the same league as the two Gaslight movies, So Evil My Love pulses throughout with tainted blood. The period flavours are lovely, the lead cast members at home in their settings, yet you will have to search far and wide for someone you can respect. Heading up the cast is Milland, who around this time was thoroughly enjoying himself playing troubled or bad boy roles, and here, as he drags all around him through the mud, he's having a grand old time of it. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the long running time proves a bit much for director Allen, who sinks into deep melodrama for a good portion of the mid- section, and this is where it comes close to being dull, but the final third is worth waiting for as the septic and the stupid trot along to their respective fate. It's also disappointing that Green's photography doesn't always enhance the turbulent atmosphere, so for better work from him seek out Hatter's Castle (1942) and the mightily great Night and the City (1950). \r\n\r\nLots to like here for period and gothic noir fans though. 7/10"

It stars George Raft, Ella Raines, Pat O'Brien, Bill Williams and Jim Backus. Music is by Frederick Hollander and cinematography by Robert De Grasse.\r\n\r\nThe scene is set, it's Los Angeles and Police Lt. Nick Ferrone (Backus) explains to us with stentorian narration about the whiles of bail bond brokers. This story is concerned with one in particular, Vince Kane (Raft), a one time policeman who followed the lure of the coin into a partnership of a bail bonds operation. It's all going swimmingly well, he's making lots of cash, has gals eating out of his hand, but when a pretty face from his past turns up requesting a favour? Vince suddenly finds himself in a quagmire of murder, deceit and emotional discord.\r\n\r\nWhat cop ever reformed?\r\n\r\nShall we cut to the chase here? This is not a \"great\" film, though I do believe that it's very under seen and therefore the meagre internet ratings it has - and the lack of reviews for it - don't quite tell the whole story.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing particularly striking about the visual aspects here, De Grasse's photography occasionally falls in line with what film noir fans consider standard procedure, which has led a few critics to question the film's film noir status. This is all about Vince Kane and how he is thrust into a murky new world by a slinky femme, it may be a whodunit in essence, but the Vince and Lucy Brackett (Raines) axis is most assuredly noir.\r\n\r\nYou phony Gumshoe!\r\n\r\nAction is in short supply, leaving much of the piece in talky territory. There's a few zinger lines of dialogue in the mix, but mostly it's screen writing 101. Yet in spite of the mixed qualities on offer here, it's a film that Raft fans are sure to enjoy, because he's very much great value as the stoic but emotionally troubled Vince. In fact O'Brien turns in one of his better performances and Raines is pleasingly sultry, meaning the cast perform well up to scratch, even if the screenplay does them few favours.\r\n\r\nA mixed bag for sure, and hardly essential for fans of such cinematic fare, but there's just enough from the cast to make this one above average. 6/10"

Harry Levine (Pacino) and Jake Manheim (Jerry Orbach), whose friendship seems to illustrate that misery loves company, have exchanged favors; Harry loaned Jake $500 to buy photographic equipment, and Jake said he would read Harry's manuscript.\r\n\r\nJake, however, has no money to pay the strapped-for-cash Harry back (both are starving artists at an age when this lifestyle has long since ceased to be a voluntary choice and has become \"nothing but a long history of failure.\"), and claims to have not read Harry’s manuscript; in fact, he has stashed the pages in the freezer like a piece of raw meat – there is something in them he finds hard to swallow, let alone digest, because to him it would be not unlike to anthropophagy.\r\n\r\nThe subject of an artist cannibalizing the experiences of someone close to them is common; in the last couple of years alone we’ve had, with varying degrees of success, Steven Soderbergh’s Let Them All Talk and Sam Levinson’s Malcolm & Marie. This material, that essentially comes down to verbal fencing, behooves from a spare setting and cast – which is why Malcolm & Marie succeeded where Let Them All Talk failed; the former is an original screenplay by Levinson, but it would easily feel at home on Broadway.\r\n\r\nChinese Coffee, adapted by Ira Lewis from his one-act play of the same name, is even more austere, taking place mostly in an apartment described as “stifling”, “thick” and “dense”, and whose windows are bolted shut. Pacino – who starred in the original stage production and directed the film adaptation – and Lewis know their stuff inside and out, and the result is lean and tight; at the same time, they wisely take advantage of the freedom afforded them by the medium of film to relieve the claustrophobia of the main set, which they leave from time to time, to visit, usually in flashback, more open spaces – unlike the play, where all the action takes place in a small apartment in Greenwich Village (at other times, however, the film simply swaps one cubbyhole for another; specifically, the basement Harry shared with his ex Joanna (Susa Floyd)."

I really did like how they explored Clarks childhood just enough to give justification to his emotions. Although there are criticism about the ending, I thought it was well made. Clark spent his entire youth listening to his father to control himself and he had to learn to make a tough decision. I think this movie has a lot of potential for a sequel if they do it right.

However, as a “Superman” movie it just did not feel right to me.\r\n\r\nThe original story is tweaked and tinkered with too much. The Kryptonians, not only General Zod and his minions, are portrayed in a quite negative light. Superman himself project a hugely negative aura. Lois Lane gets to meet Superman and learn who he really is before he even starts to work for The Daily Planet. And so on and so forth…\r\n\r\nThe first part of the movie with the back-flashes, with Kal-El just trying to hide, getting bullied etc. is just sad and even boring. It is not until General Zod arrives that things starts to get going. However even then they continue to tinker with things. Apparently it is now enough to breathe Krypton-like air for him to lose his powers. This is just so wrong. Actually, the entire bla bla when they try to “explain” his powers is just dumb. There is an established story behind Superman. Even though it is fantastic and unscientific just stick to it. It is a fantasy comic character after all. Leave it at that. The story itself is not bad but it is not Superman.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, when the fighting starts, the special effects and the action definitely have a high “coolness factor”. Superman and General Zod wrecks more havoc than half a dozen Godzillas with a bad case of hangover. Actually the level of mayhem is bordering on the ridiculous but it was fun to watch. Unfortunately I have to admit that this was my enjoyment of this movie, to watch the special effects."

Worse still, after a little white bragging lie to an old rival, Maddens finds things escalating out of his control.\r\n\r\nAh, the Christmas movie, a piece of work aimed at a certain market at a certain time of year. Many movies of Christmas past have been excruciatingly bad, either by losing sight of the holiday heart, or by going for a different angle at a season which is meant to be jolly. In the main then, the Crimble picture has been blighted by a train of thinking akin to damned if you do, damned if you don't. Debbie Isitt's Nativity! will not achieve any reviews proclaiming it to be refreshingly new, rightly so since it's a standard seasonal fare based story. What hopefully will be said is how utterly beguiling and warming the film is, so yeah! Basically a Christmas picture doing its job.\r\n\r\nChiefly in its favour is that it has a naturalness to it that keeps its charm grounded. There's no miracle in the offering here, no boink over the head with a sledgehammer to enforce its message. Isitt is happy letting the film and its delightful characters go with the flow, the result ending up as being a fully involving experience. It helps too that the army of children (plucked from local auditions by Issitt) are adorable and funny in equal measure. Not that the adults come up short either. Martin Freeman (Maddens) gives a wonderfully controlled performance as the central character, while Marc Wooton as Mr. Poppy, a character showing the child in all us adults, almost steals the movie from the delightful moppet squad. It has its faults, such as a trip to America that quickly loses momentum, and if we are honest then surely the actual Nativity finale goes on a touch too long. But such missteps are easily forgiven given the impact as a whole.\r\n\r\nMy cinema visiting group at Xmas 2009 consisted of 4 adults and 4 teenagers. As we filed out, there was a mixture of wet eyes and beaming smiles. So yeah! Job done for sure. 8/10\r\n\r\nFootnotes: Xmas 2013. With a sequel hitting the theatres this Christmas I thought it time to revisit this film. Delighted to report that it still manages to warm the old cockles of my Xmas heart and remains a seasonal picture that I urge more folk to seek out.\r\n\r\nXmas 2015. Rewatched, still lovely."

I also found Alan Carr surprisingly amusing as Patrick Burns. Interesting to see Clarke Peters, Ricky Tomlinson and Jason Watkins involved too.\r\n\r\nIt's clearly made for families and young audiences, as such I think they did a good job with this. It works. It's sweet seeing the kid cast members have so much fun with it.\r\n\r\nIntrigued to see what the three sequels have in store."

        "content": "On IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...\r\n\r\nBeing a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of \"normal\" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. \r\n\r\nAnother real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that…), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the \"old\" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.\r\n\r\nIn case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy… \r\n\r\nFinally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. \r\n\r\nWith all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything. Period.\r\n_(July 2011)_"

James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger \"Xavier\" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of \"Erik\". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of \"Shaw\" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and \"Erik\" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's \"Raven\" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky \"Hank\" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of \"Magneto\" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the \"X-Men\". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen."

First Class tells the origin story of Xavier, Magneto, and the X-Men with a 1960s setting and inexperienced young heroes. These raw and unrefined portrayals of Magneto and Xavier shined the characters in a fascinating new light. The story was engaging and fresh. It felt so new and unique - unlike anything ever seen before with this franchise. All these little-known characters raised the stakes since so many weren’t a part of the original movies leaving their fates unknown and futures unsecured. The 60s style added a cool new aesthetic to the franchise and seeing the beginning of the friendship between Xavier and Magneto with moments of laughter and fun gave the franchise the reboot it needed."

There is a bit of chemistry between the pair, and quite a fun supporting effort from Reginald Gardiner but the dialogue is too stodgy and Grable doesn't really get enough screen time in which to stamp her effervescent personality. Plenty of decent action photography - even if much of it is studio-shot, though, and Rathbone/Bruce \"Sherlock Holmes\" fans might spot an early short appearance from Dennis Hoey (\"Lestrade\").

I honestly do not remember much from the book except that I thought it was a good enough book. I also generally like Robert Shaw as an actor so when I saw that this movie was given on Paramount Channel I decided to record it for a rainy day. Well, yesterday was not a rainy day but there was not really anything else on that I felt like watching so I put this one on.\r\n\r\nIt is a fairly good movie. At least up until the end. It is a pretty much standard political thriller with the rather common basic story of a couple of terrorists planning a terrorist strike on US soil and a couple of good guys trying to stop them. Of course one of the good guys are a foreign operative with less restrained ideas about how to achieve the desired outcome. There is nothing hugely inventive about the story, although I guess it might have felt a bit more fresh in 1977 when the movie was produced, but it is mostly well implemented.\r\n\r\nI do like that the movie, as is all to often the case, does not try to “explain” the terrorists and justify their actions, at least not too much. Compared to many movie of this type (and that is why I generally do not like these movies) this one is rather neutral in terms of political sides. There are a few outbursts of “why” but in general the movie focuses on the preparations and the chase.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote, in general the movie is well implemented. The acting of both Robert Shaw and Marthe Keller, who plays the female terrorist, is not at all bad. Maybe not Oscars material but definitely not bad and, as I also wrote before, I do like Robert Shaw. For most of the movie we get to follow the preparations of the terrorists and the work of the good guys trying to unravel the plot and stop it. A few sporadic outbursts of action breaks the otherwise not so fast pace of the movie. Classical thriller material and quite enjoyable to watch.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately by the time we come to the ending it appears like the classical Hollywood I-do-not-have-clue-but-lets-throw-in-some-action people took over and it drags down an otherwise fairly well-made movie. Once the plan is uncovered the movie turns into just another let’s-spot-the-faults Hollywood B-movie. For instance, once it is clear that there is a severe threat, why is the stadium not evacuated? At least they should have gotten the president out. Given the situation why did they not have an officer or agent on the blimp in the first place? Why did Kobakov have to run all over the stadium to talk to the TV-guys, there should have been someone with communication in their hut already? And then we have the blimp chase. There was a potential threat to the president and all they could muster was a single police chopper that got shot down and another chopper that they hijacked? Kobakov laying on the blimp fumbling to get hold of the hook was also dragged out in absurdum.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote I do not remember much details from the book but this ending sure dragged down the movie for me. It is at least a star off for the ending. Still, most of the movie was enjoyable."

This is clearly designed to be an extended episode of the show, but dramatically fails in the pacing that the show was so good at.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm a big fan of Christy Carlson Romano, Shia LaBeouf is only a little less crazy than his adult self, and it is the introduction of Tim Meadows that is the big difference in the plot.\r\n\r\nA mix of \"Stuck on an island\", \"Secret Reality Show\", and \"Disfunctional Family\" tropes, it really is just a lot of \"let's mess with this family\" for most of the movie.  They stray away from the traditional use of family values to exploit the infighting to a point where they act like they're thinking about eating one another.\r\n\r\nIt's fun, but I can't imagine anyone who doesn't have history with this family are going to enjoy the movie."

Music is by Gerard Schurmann and cinematography by Gordon Dines.\r\n\r\nDetective-Superintendent Tom Halliday (Hawkins) heads up an investigation into a number of safe cracking robberies. Which in turn turns into a murder investigation.\r\n\r\nOut of Ealing Studios, this is a little cracker of a police procedural detective mystery. The flow of the investigation is natural, not given over to wild implausibilities, and always the air of mystery is potent. On the outskirts of the investigation there's a running thread about how policemen's wives/girlfriends suffer in their own ways, their men are married to the force, and this is delicately handled by the makers. While the moments of wry levity are not misplaced. Production is spiffing, with a number of London locations vibrantly used and given a film noir sheen by Dines (The Blue Lamp), while Frend (Scott of the Antarctic) keeps it tight and interesting whilst getting grand perfs from the cast - notably a wonderfully regal Hawkins.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for an old time British policer that doesn't insult your intelligence, then you need look no further. 8/10"

While his earliest film, 'Shadows', is least pleasing to me simply because I don't feel his cast there was of the quality necessary to handle that large degree of spontaneity and improvisation, by two decades later, he had refined (and perhaps perfected) his approach, and it's a great day for the two stars as well as stock company mainstay Seymour Cassel, who's always a treat to see.

It stars Jean Simmons, Katina Paxinou, Derrick De Marney, Derek Bond, Sophie Stewart and Esmond Knight. Music is by Alan Rawstone and cinematography by Robert Krasker. \r\n\r\nUpon the death of her loving father, teenager Caroline Ruthyn (Simmons) is bequeathed the family inheritance when she reaches the age of 21. In the interim she is requested to go live with her Uncle Silas (De Marney) in his ramshackle Gothic mansion. Silas was once considered unbalanced, even getting off with a murder charge when some felt he was guilty as sin, but now he seems warm towards Caroline. Is it a bluff? When Silas' weird son arrives on the scene and her fearsome former governess is found to be haunting the edges of the frames, Caroline suspects she may indeed be in danger. \r\n\r\nA film dripping with Gothic delights, Uncle Silas is undeniably dated, as evidenced by the over acting that surrounds the excellent Simmons, but this is no Jamaica Inn. Atmosphere unbound here as Charles Frank and the brilliant Robert Krasker surround the nastiness of the plot with nightmarish visuals and scenes fit to grace any bigger budgeted horror of the decade. \r\n\r\nThe mansion is a classic fit for such a tale of heiress stalk and kill fare, though it is more run down than the opulence of something like Manderley. With 90% of the picture shot in dark and shadows, where light comes via candles and firesides, the mood of impending peril is always high. Add in a few stormy nights, mysterious rooms, locked gates and characters straight out of one of James Whale's dreams and you are good to go for bodice bedlam. \r\n\r\nDirector Charles Frank (co-writer The Late Edwina Black) had no career whatsoever, which on this evidence is baffling. OK! He wasn't able to rein in De Marney and Paxinou on this one, though in the case of the latter it's a glorious case where excess fits the nightmarish dream-scape, but some of his visual touches hint at what a good noir style director he could have been. With two nightmare sequences superb, one Brandy inspired and an array of canted angles and shadowy menaced frames filing out the piece, this shows superbly someone able to sustain foreboding atmosphere. \r\n\r\nIn some sources it is listed that Nigel Huke was co-cinematographer, but on others not so, and I certainly didn't see his name on the credits when the film rolled? But what we can see for sure is Krasker at his best. In the same year as Uncle Silas he would elevate Carol Reed's Odd Man Out to classic cinematography status, and two years later he would of course be an integral part of what made The Third Man the deservingly revered picture it is. Uncle Silas represents something of a must see for Krasker purists. It's also definitely a film that Simmons fans should seek out. \r\n\r\nThe over acting will irritate some, and the mid-point drags as it goes into gaiety mode and nearly derails the suspenseful mood that has been built up deftly. But it quickly overcomes this and gets back on track to be a cracker waiting to be gorged on by like minded film fans. It would make a nice appetiser to Ealing's brilliant Queen of Spades, or as B support to The Spiral Staircase. It was released as The Inheritance in the States, and had changes made, suffice to say that anyone interested in this movie should see only the British version. Maybe that was where Huke was involved? In the American cut? Oh well, Uncle Silas, Brit version, wonderfully kinked. 8/10"

Jean Simmons (\"Caroline\") inherits a great deal of money from her father, but until she becomes of age she must move into the ramshackle stately pile of her kindly uncle \"Silas\" (Derrick De Marney). Well, at least he sounded kindly - but once she is safely ensconced in his home, it soon becomes clear that he hasn't two brass farthings to rub together and so has his beady eyes on her fortune. The house also entertains his peculiar son \"Austin\" (Reginald Tate) and her conspiratorial governess - the nasty piece of work that is \"Madama de la Rougierre\" (Katina Paxinou). Aside from a slightly foppish De Marnay, this is a well cast drama with plenty of well photographed, darkly lit, scenarios to keep the mystery bubbling along - helped significantly by Simmons' wonderfully butter-wouldn't-melt characterisation of the initially gullible, but not entirely foolish \"Caroline\", particularly when contrasted with the juicily menacing governess. Rarely seen, but I can't think why - it has all the ingredients and although the ending is a shade on the disappointing side, is still at the top end of this light horror genre."

Eiji Okada plays the country's revolutionary leader, a previous best-friend of MacWhite (Brando) who may be brainwashed by the communists.

Unfortunately, it’s too quaint and lacks the pizzazz of previous political-conflict movies, like “Lawrence of Arabia” (1962) and “The Bridge on the River Kwai” (1957). Brando does a serviceable job, but he’s curiously missing his usual charisma, probably because he didn’t contribute much to the story, like he did in his more captivating performances, e.g. “The Young Lions” (1958) and “One-Eyed Jacks” (1961).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 3 minutes, and was shot in Thailand.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+"

It stars Robert Wagner, Joanne Woodward, Virginia Leith, Jeffrey Hunter and Mary Astor. A CinemaScope/De Luxe Color production, music is by Lionel Newman and cinematography by Lucien Ballard.\r\n\r\nPlot basically finds Wagner as a scheming pretty boy willing to commit murder in order to reach the riches of an inheritance. Story bubbles away nicely as Bud Corlis (Wagner) and Dorothy Kingship (Woodward), he sly and distant - she vulnerable and love struck, both hold court with performances of merit. The spiky edge comes by way of knowing what Bud is up to, and that poor Dorothy is completely oblivious, and when the key moment comes, it's shocking and really perches ones expectation levels to the edge of the seat.\r\n\r\nSadly the second half of the movie doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first, for here the focus shifts from a twist into an investigation by Dorothy's sister, Ellen (Leith), who refuses to accept the official party line surrounding her sister. It's all very competently mounted, but the pervading sense of menace has dissipated and in place is just an average murder mystery.\r\n\r\nWagner and Woodward are very good, Leith not so much, while Hunter as a pipe smoking professor is badly miscast and Astor is under used. Oswald's direction is fine, with some nifty long takes and some very cheeky visual jokes that only become apparent once story has run its course. Ballard's Scope photography is impressive, managing to make the bright colourful city surrounds always appear as threatening, and Newman's musical arrangements are indicative of the murder mystery splinter of 50s film noir.\r\n\r\nThe themes at the core of the picture are daring and interesting, though more should have been made of the hinted at fact that Bud is a troubled war veteran. It's not all that it can be, the second half diluting the whole as it were, but this is still a tasty noir thriller worthy of catching. 7/10"

Music is by John Greenwood and Paul Sawtell and cinematography by Robert Krasker. \r\n\r\nA whole bunch of fun if expectation levels are correctly set. Another Man's Poison is essentially a one set piece (confirming its stage origins), with primary focus on just five people and a horse. It's a tale of murder, deception and carnal desires, the latter of which is wrung out via Janet Frobisher's (Davis) affair with a much younger man who happens to be the intended of her secretary. \r\n\r\nFrobisher is quite frankly a bitch, something which Davis attacks with relish and no little amount of histrionic camp. She's the fulcrum of the story, but all the other key characters here are either stupid, ignorant, devious or all three in one go! Oh yes, this is a regular hot-bed of people you really wouldn't want to be hanging around with for too long. \r\n\r\nIt's these characterisations that along with Krasker's photography just about earns the pic its film noir badge. The script isn't up to much - where stories about changes being made by Williams and that Davis and Merrill (husband and wife at the time) being unhappy – are common place, but it never outstays its welcome by being boring, and ultimately Bette being batty is always good entertainment. 6.5/10"

His performance has an innocence about it that lends much to the gentle comedy of film. Maude Eburne is also good as \"Aunt Kate\" who has finessed the facial expression to a fine art.

        "content": "The rise of the internet in the 1990s suddenly gave people the ability to talk and form communities about all kinds of weird niche hobbies and mysteries that, as isolated individuals, they previously had to muse over in silence. One of these, I remember, was the \"Toynbee Tiles\", linoleum squares left on the streets of Philadelphia over these years that contained the cryptic message \"Toynbee idea in Kubrick's 2001 Resurrect dead on planet Jupiter\". (It's an odd American analogue to the mysterious man in Australia who used to go around scrawling \"Eternity\" everywhere.) The Toynbee tile maker was obviously a nutter, but in spite of much speculation among enthusiasts who would upload photos of tile sightings and try to riddle out the message, his or her identity remained a mystery... until this 2011 documentary film.\r\n\r\nRESURRECT DEAD tracks the work of an investigative team of nerds as they put together the pieces of Toynbee sightings from the late 1970s to the present, ultimately identifying the tile maker with an overwhelming degree of accuracy. These are Justin Duerr, the main face of the film, along with Colin Smith and Steve Weinik. Justin Duerr strikes this viewer as hella autistic, and his consuming interest in collecting Toynbee tile information and social awkwardness fills every frame. (And am I the only one who thinks that his jerky mannerisms and obsession resemble cinema auteur Wes Anderson?) But Duerr is also an artist, and he's so curious about the Toynbee tile maker because he recognizes in the man, mentally ill though the tiler might be, a fellow artist and creative individual.\r\n\r\nThe Toynbee tiler wasn't just leaving tiles. For a time in the 1980s, he would drive around Philadelphia broadcasting his theories over pirate radio. In the middle portion of RESURRECT DEAD, the trio of investigators make contact with radio enthusiasts who prove to have had some limited contact with the tiler back in the day. As the film ends, they have traced the tile maker to a Philadelphia address that belongs to a paranoid recluse. He refuses to answer the door, but his neighbours provide key information, like the fact that his car has a hole in the floorboard, presumably to drop the tiles surreptitiously. The decision to name this recluse might upset some viewers, but besides that single knock on the door and a mailed letter, the filmmakers don't try to intrude on his life, and they decide to just let him be, basking in the satisfaction that they've solved the mystery.\r\n\r\nI was intrigued by the tiles when I first came across the Toynbee tile community on the early web, around 1995 or so, and though I was never an obsessive like these filmmakers, the idea of the Toynbee tiles remained in the back of my mind as a quirky mystery over the years. While I was happy to discover that everything is now clear, I was disappointed by this documentary film. Its 90-minute length has a lot of filler, like dumb slow-motion replays of the group looking stunned as they learn key facts. Justin Duerr's narration to the camera is chock-a-block with \"like\", \"uh...\", \"so...\", \"you know...\" -- could he have not thought more clearly what he was going to say for his own film?\r\n\r\nUltimately, I commend these investigators for their achievement, but anyone curious about the Toynbee tiles should just read the bare facts as laid out in 5 minutes' reading of press coverage of the investigation, or on everyone's favourite online encyclopedia. Sitting through an hour and a half of this doc just feels like wasted time."

This one sees the suave Don Stannard in the title role, on the trail of some dastardly villains bent on world domination using a mind-controlling frequency. Director Godfrey Grayson offers us quite a well paced intrigue with plenty of action, the double-dealing \"Tina\" (Jean Lodge) and a tense little conclusion that passes an hour easily enough. The production is basic, and in this particular story the audio effects of their device did prove to be actually quite annoying after a while. Luckily there is no real jeopardy whatsoever so that's soon sorted out. Though entirely predictable, I still quite enjoyed it."

(Later, I discovered that I could have just unplugged both for ten minutes and everything would have been normal. You live, you learn. It taught me to pay more attention to what was happening on the screen, so it wasn't an entirely wasted endeavor.)\r\n\r\nHere, the weakness, as always, was Ronald Reagan, who makes Keanu Reeves look like a great actor. Still, he wasn't bad (it was a war film, after all, with a role he was born to play), and he and Flynn were assisted by great supporting players, such as Raymond Massey and Alan Hale, who are always 'cash money' for me IMHO. As well, you have one of the greatest American directors of the period in Raoul Walsh, so it's basically win, win, win--except if you're a Nazi."

During the war, American actors engaged in the military effort in films that sought to boost morale and incite combat, with the heroism of the Americans and British being almost the key to defeating the Axis, and the attractive Resistance girls to be their perfect romantic matches.\r\n\r\nThis film takes the heroes, a British and American flight crew, on a suicide mission into German territory: to destroy a railway junction heavily defended by guns and anti-aircraft artillery. Obviously, they are shot down and, from then on, begins an unstoppable game of cat and mouse with the German soldiers in which, virtually by miracle, they cross enemy territory, even passing through Berlin! And all this without any kind of previously organized plan, London directive or any resistance connection that could help them. Just luck and a great pair of... guts!\r\n\r\nThe film is really far from being good, or even competent. It can only be understood by virtue of the times then lived. However, it manages to entertain us reasonably if we turn off our brains. It's action and suspense from start to finish, with great actors, with Errol Flynn and a young Ronald Reagan being the great protagonists. They are good actors, and their worth is not in question, but really, there are very few real challenges for them: the film is simply concerned with showing Allied heroism and ridiculing the German military machine as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that the production did not bet on a good script, or on good dialogues, there was also no bet on the quality of production values or effects. The cinematography is regular and works fine, but it doesn't enchant us, and the sets and costumes are more or less within what had to be done, even if it's not really brilliant. I liked, however, the cars that were used, and the car chase through the muddy fields of Holland. Hope they didn't spoil too many tulip bulbs."

I was okay with that as long as the story and characters were strong. Besides, nowadays it seems like many mainstream physicists are seriously promoting the ideas around multiple universes or perhaps even an infinite number of alternate universes, perhaps science is catching up with the fiction. (Though I still think a planet popping into our galaxy so close to us would cause cataclysmic tides and whatnot.) . In any case, I recently bought and downloaded a digital version of it to watch it again.\r\n\r\nBut Another Earth isn’t about physics or science or what would become of humanity if a twin earth and moon suddenly showed up in our sky. It is about a heart-stopping event that cause a planet full of people to stop what they are doing and look up and wonder. Is that earth different than ours? Am I up there, and if so, is that version exactly like me or have they made different decisions that affect who they have become? Could I have made different decisions, or was this version of me locked into what I decided and thought? And in the case of our lead character, Rhoda, it leads her to a path to seek forgiveness and try to make up for a tragic mistake she made a couple of years earlier, actually on the day the second earth appeared.\r\n\r\nSo I will say no more about the plot, let alone the surprising little twist deep in the movie. You really feel for these characters. They seem real and you care about them. Kumamoto Pallana steals the scenes he is involved with. Because of the internal turmoil and the questions Rhoda is asking herself, even ordinary interactions with other characters feel imbued with deeper meaning. As a side note, it was written by the woman who plays Rhoda. \r\n\r\nTry not to watch it when you are tired, but do try to watch it."

What now ensues is a tautly directed thriller with plenty of action that takes us all around Morocco and Europe before quite a gripping conclusion to the intrigue leaves everyone unsure who they can trust. Christopher McQuarrie seems to have decided to go back to the television series for reference here, the teamwork (even from the usually terrible Pegg) and the plot develop more plausibly and excitingly; it has a grittier and more substantial story to it, and even if Cruise looks a little unkempt from time to time, that narrative is just better - it actually is a thriller rather than just another piece of star-led boisterous entertainment. Like most films that depict the principle of US Senate oversight, it continues to poke fun at the (in)competencies of that body to even make a proper cup of coffee; there is some humour in the dialogue and it's put the franchise very much back on track."

The world of the IMF expands beyond its star agent Ethan Hunt by showing agents on other missions and giving Hunt’s team backstories and development. Brad Bird’s Pixar charm rubs off on the film with fun, quirky moments punctuating the incredible action set pieces and providing a little breathing room in the intense face-paced plot. The quality of new characters and the pedigree of the actors playing them seems to prepare the franchise for spin-offs or even a changing of the guard (if Tom Cruise ever wanted to pass the movies on to a new lead). Ghost Protocol sets a new bar for the Mission Impossible series that causes its successors to thrive as they reach for its level of excellence. If you didn’t want to watch all 6 (and soon to be 8), Ghost Protocol wouldn’t be a bad place to start."

This is a portrayal of the infamous outlaw before he became just that. Film is telling of what he was before he made his first kill, his weak standing in society, his turbulent family life, and is tentative steps to making friends - where he is clingy extreme. The backdrop is one of mud and rags, there is no showy Wild West here, it very much operates as an Anti-Western, an independent picture firmly offering up a flip side to some of the legends printed as fact. Technically it is just ok, where things are strongly hindered by Pollard simply being too old. Asking a 33 year old man to play a teenager is a stretch, it is with much credit that Pollard gives it his all and nails at the least the village idiot side of Billy pre his fame.\r\n\r\nNot a hidden gem by any stretch of the imagination, it does however show up a side to Billy The Kid not often told in the history of film and literature. Worth seeking out for that point of reference, but as entertainment or a viable Western film of note? I'm not sure. 5/10"

        "content": "I blame him for saying he did.\r\n\r\nMeek's Cutoff is directed by Kelly Reichardt and written by Jonathan Raymond. It stars Michelle Williams, Bruce Greenwood, Will Paton, Paul Dano, Shirley Henderson, Neal Huff, Zoe Kazan and Tommy Nelson. Music is by Jeff Grace and cinematography by Chris Blauvelt. Story is based on an historical incident on the Oregon Trail in 1845, when frontier guide Stephen Meek (Greenwood) led a small band of settlers across the trail in search of richer pastures. For what was meant to be a two week journey, has now turned into five, and the settlers have this horrible feeling that Meek is lost. With no end to the journey in sight, low on food and water, and becoming ravaged by the terrain, the group starts to come apart at the seams.\r\n\r\nThose familiar with Kelly Reichardt's work, Old Joy/Wendy & Lucy, will have some idea that Meek's Cutoff was never going to be a traditional Western picture. Often cited as a low-key, minimalist, director, Reichardt has stripped the Western right back to craft a beautifully shot film dealing with the hardships endured both physically and mentally of three families out on the Oregon Trail. Opening without dialogue for the opening seven minutes, where the first voice we hear is that of a child reading Tree of Life, tone is set from the off. We are asked to fill in the blanks ourselves, but it's evident that the group are in trouble, they already look haggard, afraid and near desperation. From here dialogue is as sparse as the terrain they traverse, the wagons crawl at pace, and so to does the film, a slow pace that remains throughout. The interest is all about the characters and their reactions to the situations that arise, no soft soaping or corner cutting, it's stark and uncompromising.\r\n\r\nThis is a different Wild West, the characters are etched into a parched, sun-bleached landscape, there's no romanticism here, just emotional turmoil, it's like the group are in purgatory, desperately trying to reach that Tree of Life on the other side of yet another obstacle. Shot in the 1.33 aspect ratio, this neatly puts the characters front and centre, most tellingly the women, who are the crux of Meek's Cutoff. This viewpoint gives the film a further lift out of the norm, deftly observing the family based woman's place in the West. One of a number of indelible moments in the piece sees the men move away from the women, who have to observe from distance as the men make the crucial decisions, left holding onto the last vestiges of the civilisation left behind, it says so much without actually doing much, something that Meek's Cutoff thrives on.\r\n\r\nThe acting is superb, with Williams, Paton and Greenwood leading the way. This collection of thespians really inhabit their roles, giving the film conviction. Conviction born out by Blauvelt's yellow and brown ochres. Grace's music is also sparse, but telling in a film that mostly deals in quiet conversations, or the natural sounds of wheels turning and tin cups clanking. It's finally detailed and the director wants us to not only examine said details, but also to be part of them. It has already proved to be a most divisive picture, something that is very understandable, even to someone like myself who has been beguiled by it. Where some see a slow crawl where nothing much happens, others see a rich human interest journey where the complete opposite is the case. Regardless of how it eventually works out for the viewer, it remains a film that serious Western fans simply have to see and evaluate. 9/10"

        "content": "Young Adult tells the story of 37-year-old Mavis Gary – a pathologically unhappy, immature, egotistical girl in a grown woman's body. Upon hearing of her ex-boyfriend's new born baby, she decides that they are still meant for each other, and the fact that he is now happily married to The Perfect Woman is but a minor detail on their road to eternal bliss. More simply put… Mavis is bat s*** crazy.\r\n\r\nGoing into this movie, I thought it was going to be a hilarious comedy, full of LOL moments. Actually it is nothing of the sort. Thinking about it, seeing the way this \"adult\" woman lives out her life (sleeping till noon, living in a pigsty, forgetting to take care of her dog and playing children's video games), is really incredibly sad. No, it's pathetic. She is the author of 'young adult' books, which in any other case is a perfectly fine job, except in hers it basically means she vicariously lives the life of her main character – a high school girl. This is the emotional level Mavis is stuck in.\r\n\r\nHearing about her ex-boyfriend's baby stirs an awkward obsession in Mavis. She packs her bags and returns to her small hometown in Minnesota – completely convinced that she and her ex Buddy are destined to be together. Back home, it's obvious the people she left behind know her a little better than she knows herself. Basically, everybody knows her… and everybody hates her. And who can blame them… Mavis is quite simply the most childish, entitled, RIDICULOUSLY selfish woman there ever was. Thankfully there's at least one old acquaintance from her past who's willing to look beyond all that. His name is Matt, he walks with a crutch because he once was the victim of a horrible hate crime, and he is the only one who listens to her.\r\n\r\nWhat I love about this story is the fact that, although it starts out as a comedy, it gradually flows and meanders into a beautifully crafted, delicate character drama. Mavis, at first sight, is a hysterical character, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that this woman has some deep seeded issues, no matter how hard she tries to cover up for it. Mavis is played wonderfully by Charlize Theron, who delivers one of her most hilarious, yet at the same time, understated performances to date. She could have easily gone overboard with this character, but somehow manages to humanize this completely unlikable woman. In fact, I'm willing to state that about 80% of Young Adult 'works' because of her. She displays some of her best work in two very intense scenes, where Mavis' sky high ego comes crashing down, leaving her remarkably exposed and vulnerable. That right there was some truly wonderful acting on her part.\r\n\r\nMatt is played very amiably by Patton Oswalt, who seems to be the only character in town with any emotional intelligence. Although this character may be a bit of a cliché (the wise, sympathetic loser with a physical disability and a traumatizing past), that's OK because it works. Oswalt's acting clearly takes a shot at versatility and he passed with flying colours, as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nI love the script. Penned by Diablo Cody (writer of Juno), it's full of sharp, sassy character traits and dialogue, while remaining very subtle and human. As a story, it doesn't honestly have that much to offer but it's a joy to watch for the high quality of 'human relatableness', I guess I could call it. Actually, I can't really think of any major flaws. It has an awesome soundtrack, all the actors are very well cast and the direction was placed perfectly in the very capable hands of Jason Reitman.\r\n\r\nThis is a small film, about basic, non-glamorous human behavior and a big girl who might find happiness yet, if only she wants it badly enough. Highly recommended.\r\n_(January 2015)_"

To be honest, I found this quite a hard watch - Theron is so convincingly odious as to make me want to throttle her.

I guess it is rather superfluous to mention that the movie is based on the book The Hobbit by Tolkien. However it is here the problems start.\r\n\r\nIn my review of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey the first thing that I mentioned was that you should be aware of the fact that the movie did not follow the book in any great detail and that this was quite okay since the extensions were well made. Well, it should be no surprise that the first part of this statement is valid for this movie as well. Unfortunately, whereas the first movie felt like a fluid extension of the book this one feels like it is just full of fillers.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of cool scenes and a lot of action but it really feels like it was just put in there as fillers to showcase the special effects. Speaking of special effects, quite a few of them where rather unimpressive I have to say. The scenes where the dwarfs went down the rapids in barrels frequently looked plastic and artificial. The scenes with Smaug was not too bad even though he was quite overused but the parts around the forges was just plain ridiculous. I know it is fantasy but come one, getting them started and producing tons and tons of molten gold in a few minutes not to mention riding on molten metal without getting burned was just silly.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I found it an enjoyable movie but I was expecting more."

It isn't anything bad, but it goes on for too long - yet the ending itself comes out of nowhere a little. It's iffily crafted, with the entertainment value not enough to cover it up. Again, nothing anywhere near terrible... just not as great as I wanted/expected.\r\n\r\nI also kinda wanted more scenes with Martin Freeman (Bilbo) across the midway point. I like the focus on Richard Armitage (Thorin) & Co. but I felt there needed to be more with the lead - and with Ian McKellen (Gandalf), for that matter.\r\n\r\nI've led with my negatives first, but I have many positives too. I enjoyed the scenes in Esgaroth with Luke Evans (Bard), all of the stuff there looks awesome. The character of Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lilly, is cool. Orlando Bloom (Legolas) remains fun to watch. Everything else, including the score, is very nicely done - as anticipated.\r\n\r\nLove the end credits song (\"I See Fire\") by Ed Sheeran, by the way. Not quite as grand and great as \"May It Be\" from LOTR, but it's pretty close!"

        "content": "I'm afraid I still really struggled with the lightweight casting here, but once I'd convinced myself to get over that, I found this to be a far more characterful and entertaining adventure. With the dragon \"Smaug\" now safely in possession of the gold, it falls to \"Thorin\" (Richard Armitage) and his band of dwarves to make their way - via the misty mountains and the realm of the elves - to the human settlement of \"Laketown\" where the nimble-fingered \"Bilbo\" (Martin Freeman) must find and use a secret way into the lair so he can try to repossess the \"Arkenstone\". Meantime, the mischievous \"Gandalf\" (Sir Ian McKellen) is off having escapades of his own in the South? Will they rendezvous in time to thwart the increasingly narked fire-breather. What is clear here is that some of the philosophising from the book is very much on the back burner. This is an out-and-out action movie with loads of combat scenes, some very clever visual effects that almost rendered me a bit sea-sick at times - all built around a solid story of companionship and determination. Characters are playing to their strengths and weaknesses; relationships are being forged and challenged; courage is being found - and lost and it's all enjoyable and engaging to watch on the big screen. Maybe I could have been doing without the romantic interludes (yuk!) but for the most part this is a great looking and visionary interpretation that just happens to have a cast that really should have been so much better. A good, not a great, watch that tees us up nicely for the finale."

They’re both Fort & Indians Westerns taking place in the Northwest with Red Cloud & his braves as the antagonists. The assault on the fort in the movie recalls Red Cloud’s real-life siege of Fort Phil Kearney in the shadow of the Big Horn Mountains in the Wyoming Territory where attacks were launched against troops & settlers for two years from 1866-1868.\r\n\r\nOne great thing about this Western is the character played by Kirk Douglas, Johnny Hawks. He’s a robust individualist who refuses moronic sectarianism in the wilderness conflict. He sees beyond mere skin color & culture and focuses on character and mutual benefit while driven by self-interest, albeit not in an ignoble way. He’s brave & confident, yes, but he’s neither a blind hero nor a sullen antihero out for revenge; he’s a nonconformist loner brimming with joie de vivre that doesn’t care if people hate him (unjustly) and absolutely refuses social manipulations.\r\n\r\nThe exciting Oglala attack on the Fort is one of the highlights. It reveals the most practical way to assault a stronghold made of lumber in the wilds. Regrettably, the key Native characters are played by Caucasians, but there weren’t many quality actors of Amer-Indian descent back then. Thankfully, the peripheral Natives appear to be real Amer-Indians. Basically, just pretend that Red Cloud, Grey Wolf and Onahti look more Amer-Indian than they do. Problem solved.\r\n\r\nThis was the first film produced by Kirk and he allowed his ex-wife, Diana Douglas, to play the settler woman from the wagon train who clearly wants him for a husband (obviously an inside joke). This shows that Kirk and Diana had a good relationship despite their divorce in 1951. Meanwhile tall Italian Elsa Martinelli plays the native girl that Johnny aggressively woos, the aforementioned Onahti. Make no mistake, Onahti was attracted to Johnny and he knew it; thus he goes after what he wants.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 28 minutes, and was shot in the area of Bend, Oregon, including Smith Rock State Park and also the Deschutes National Forest.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

People start mysterious dying.\r\n\r\n\"The last Horror Film,\" aka “Fanatic” (1982), is a fun, but curiously obscure American slasher that only cost $2 million, yet that’s more than enough to make a quality slasher seeing as how “Halloween” cost just $325,000 four years earlier (the bulk of the budget was spent on expensive location shooting and permits).\r\n\r\nCaroline was 32 during shooting and attractive, but she was already beyond her physical prime, which can be observed in “The Spy Who Loved Me” five years prior. She has hair highlights throughout that detract from her beauty. However, there are peripheral beauties, which is to be expected given the setting.\r\n\r\nDespite the gory kills, this is not a scary slasher, such as the first “Friday the 13th.” There’s a wink of amusement to the proceedings, like it’s all a joke. But it can be enjoyed if you roll with it; it’s just not meant to be taken too seriously.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 27 minutes, and was shot New York City (opening scenes) and France (Cannes, Pont de la Vierge Noire and Château de Pelly), as well as Los Angeles (strip club) and Lake Geneva, Switzerland (castle sequence).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

The duty falls to one intrepid Captain Scott, the only chance to achieve the aim is by train, with his allies on board being a rather unique group of individuals, can Scott achieve the mission against the mounting odds?.\r\n\r\nNorth West Frontier has everything a great action adventure should have, whilst also adding in tension, drama and an array of wonderfully colourful characters. The opening to the film is pulsating, as Scott has to fight off the rebels whilst smuggling the prince and his governess out to safety. From then on we are on a train journey that is rich with enjoyment, the tension mounts among the passengers, not least because of the class and cultural differences, and perhaps allmotives are not in alignment? But they must club together if they are to survive this dangerous journey.\r\n\r\nKenneth Moore, Lauren Bacall, Herbert Lom and Wilfrid Hyde-White (comedy gold when under attack) are all pulling together to make a cracking yarn. Directing duties falls to J. Lee Thompson, whose CV boasts \"Ice Cold In Alex\", \"The Guns Of Navarone\" and \r\n\"Cape Fear\", so this material was thankfully in very safe hands. The photography from Geoffrey Unsworth is top notch, barren and desolate landscapes beautifully realising the peril of the passengers' journey, whilst the music from Mischa Spoliansky leaves a lasting impression.\r\n\r\nThis train may well be crammed full of genre stereotypes, and sure enough the patronising nature of the piece is dated at the edges, but this remains a gloriously enjoyable film that the whole family can readily digest. 9/10"

He concludes that the only way he can be certain is to track down the real doppelgänger before he ends up suffering the same dispossession and deportation as those he had thus far all too readily exploited. One can never have enough of Jeanne Moreau and her role as the enigmatic \"Florence\" is a little undercooked here, but as the rest of this complex thriller builds up steam we see Joseph Losey using Delon,  and our own appreciation of just how terrifying it must have been for most during the occupation let alone the Jewish population, as weapons to potently reveal that terror and to ultimately maybe even humanise - as well as, perhaps, ridicule - this most venal and shallow of men. Is he now the hunted? Can he escape with his life? The more he thinks he has swum away from danger, the more the maelstrom seems to embrace him - and that catch 22 scenario is enthralling to watch play out here. It's cleverly photographed with a score that augments our own - and his - sense of increasing peril and frustration and though it's perhaps just a little slow at the start, it turns into a cracker."

Starring Forest Whitaker (Dennis Curren) and Anthony Edwards (Alex Kearney), Downtown is as much about a fish out of water scenario than it is polar opposite cops working together. With both things dovetailing together to create an engaging actioner that's worth the time of those who are stuck for something light to watch.\r\nSuffering a touch in the last finale due to an inevitable mawkish character strand, some minor irks stop this from reaching greater heights, chiefly that David Clennon's barely grumpy villain is just not strong enough for some dramatic heft. However, there's some genuinely funny scenes between Edwards and Whitaker, the action set-pieces are well staged and thus Downtown gets most of the genre's requisites right. Nice Nice support comes from Joe Pantoliano as a bizarre looking hit-man and Penelope Ann Miller as Kearney's fraught girlfriend, Lori Mitchell. 6.5/10"

Sure, several of the youths are mostly annoying at first, but it’s so exaggerated it’s obviously camp; plus their arses are all humbled in good time, BIG TIME. Moreover, the three girls are appealing in a girl-next-door type of way despite their initial obnoxiousness, particularly Amber Marie Bollinger as Jessica and Ashley Watkins as Jenny (while blonde Sarah Zurell ain’t nothing to sneeze at). The Irish bloke is easily the most irksome male, but he’s willing to boldly sacrifice everything to save one of the girls. That's not just likable, but noble and heroic!\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, unlike \"Wrong Turn,\" the movie mixes-in comedy and parody reminiscent of 2007's \"Wrong Turn 2: Dead End,” but some people apparently didn’t get the memo. In any case, while nothing great, \"Pelt\" is worth catching if you like backwoods slasher flicks. I actually like it better than \"Wrong Turn\" (it has far better women) and it's close to being on par with \"Wrong Turn 2.\" Not to mention, Amber Marie Bollinger (Jessica) scampering around the woods in flimsy attire is worth the price of admission.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 87 minutes and was shot in Northern California, which is a weak stand-in for Kentucky because anyone who's been to Kentucky knows it doesn't look like Northern California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

Starring Charlton Heston and Jack Palance, directed by Charles Marquis Warren; who also adapts the screenplay from W.R. Burnett's novel, Adobe Walls, Arrowhead rewrites the Indian Wars and firmly paints the Apache as distrustful thugs. \r\n\r\nBased in essence on real life Indian scout, Al Seiber, with Heston in the role but named as Ed Bannon here, story is set in Texas 1878 at the Fort Clark cavalry post. Peace has been brokered and the good old cavalry boys have arranged for the Apache, led by a newly educated Toriano (Palance), to be dog tagged and whipped off to some arid land in Florida. However, the pesky Toriano has been plotting a revolution and is ready to lead his people in an all out assault on whitey and to hell with the treaty. Only white dude who smells a rat is Bannon, who with some Indian blood coursing through his veins, hates the Redskins and will never trust them. But the cavalry hate Bannon as well, because he is in the way, causing friction, a hindrance to their wonderful ideas for piece.\r\n\r\nNo surprises for guessing what happens next! If Warren and the big wigs at Paramount Pictures were aware of the racist overtones here in 1953? Is cause for debate. I tend to agree with the theory that puts this as a sort of anti-communist allegory, but of course that doesn't excuse the xenophobic narrative whoever is on the receiving end! Yet surely the makers were genuine in trying to make a good old Cavalry versus Indians actioner? That the picture often meanders and is not carpeted with action, is a little moot, but it is well put together, well acted and looks nice with it's actual real Bracketville location filming (Ray Rennahan on cinematography). Paul Sawtell does one of his robust thematic musical scores, and fine acting support comes from Robert Wilkie and Brian Keith.\r\n\r\nIt's a solid routine Oater, and can be enjoyed if you can forgive it its sins? Forgive them for they know not what they do...or something like that! 6/10"

He is suspicious when the son of the chief, Toriano (Jack Palance), is returning from his education back East at the same time the Chiricahuas are meeting the U.S. Army. He solemnly warns that they will not peaceably be shipped off to Florida. Brian Keith plays the new commanding officer of the fort in his feature film debut. Katy Jurado and Mary Sinclair are also on hand.  \r\n\r\n\"Arrowhead\" (1953) was based on W.R. Burnett’s novel wherein the author patterned Ed Bannon (Heston) after the real-life Albert Sieber. Meanwhile the film was shot at the actual Fort Clark in Brackettville, Texas. As such, it has some authenticity in its favor even while a bit marred by the dated style of its era. The problem is some people don’t want ugly reality, but rather political correctness.    \r\n\r\nI don’t get what the problem is. Bannon is understandably cheerless in a tense life-or-death situation while the Chiricahuas are depicted as formidable warriors who are willing to fight to the death. The movie portrays the culmination of the Indian Wars (as far as the Apaches go) in a fictitious story backed by factual material and it’s not pleasant, but rather grim and brutal. It was the Indian _WARS_, after all, not the Indian love-in.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

If I'm honest, I found Douglas' character really quite annoying, smug almost - the strong-willed Crawford seems to fall for his scheming all too easily, and predictably - and although it is quite en enjoyable flimsy to watch, it just didn't quite work for me. Young tries quite hard as her long-suffering adviser, and there are a couple of stereotypical, mildly amusing, contributions from Billie Burke and Nydia Westman - who much preferred knitting to working. It's good to see the star trying to play a different style of role from her usual 1940s power-dressing type and she does it well enough, though without too much sparkle.

The monochrome stop-motion animation (especially their eyes!) and typically fun Danny Elfman score make for an effective comedy-horror and it is hard not to engage with the reincarnated patchwork puppy. Their rather menacing science teacher \"Rzykruski\" reminded me of Christopher Lee, too. It's a quickly paced and engaging tale with a gentle morality to it - love, loyalty, friendship all feature strongly in a narrative that goes some way to illustrate how, illogically sometimes, people can become attached to their pets.

Music is by Joseph Nussbaum and cinematography by Hal Mohr. \r\n\r\nArchitect Jeff Cohalan (Young) is a troubled man, after the mysterious death of his fiancée in a car crash, he has been acting strangely and lives a lonely life at the Hilltop House he designed for his bride to be. When he meets Ellen Foster (Drake), things perk up as he becomes attracted to her.

The house at the centre of tale is a modern development, which is a shame as it goes against the coastal atmosphere lifting up from the Carmel-On-Sea location that was used for these parts of the film, but otherwise there’s a strong brooding mystery bubbling away throughout. As the bizarre instances of misfortune start to mount up on Jeff Cohalan, with director Kern showing a good appreciation of pacing, it builds up a menacing head of steam and then unravels a better than adequate denouement. \r\n\r\nVivian, Vivian, Vivian… \r\n\r\nYoung and Drake inevitably tug at a romantic thread, but they make for an engaging couple and Drake especially gets her teeth into a female role of intelligent substance. John Sutton files in for some decent caddish quotient and Bates and O’Neil add some professionally elder support. Mohr’s (Bullets or Ballets/The Lineup) photography is the key, consistently at one with the psychological beats of the plotting, his lighting compositions make the film seem far more higher in production value than it was. \r\n\r\nA tale of memory lapses, pet bothering, depression, ugly real estate, dastards and romance, is nicely cloaked by ominous coastal atmospherics and Tchaikovsky! 7/10"

        "content": "An apple a day keeps the doctor away...\r\n\r\nDoctor in the House was released in 1954 and promptly became the start of a franchise of Brit comedy films. The quality and standard of each film, a total of seven, varies and will always be a subject of debate among fans. Clover, the 6th offering, isn't particularly great, and minus series regular Dirk Bogarde, it is often painted as the runt of the litter. Yet there are some strengths worthy of time spent with the pic to save it from sequel damnation.\r\n\r\nLeslie Phillips fronts up as the focal point, he's a randy doctor who as he attempts to go about his fanciful Lothario ways, becomes acutely aware of his advancing years, cue his attempts at looking young. James Robertson Justice is still on hand as the boisterous Sir Lancelot Spratt, while Joan Sims, Fenella Fielding, Arthur Haynes, Shirley Anne Field and John Fraser are filing in for some daft medical shenanigans.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit \"Carry On\" lite, at times feeling like it's trying to be more risqué than is possible. Yet Fielding and Haynes are super as strong personality patients, Phillips carries the movie with ease, while Justice cuts lose from the gruff persona - to see him have fun courtesy of a dubious serum plot line. Nobody's idea of a British classic, for sure, but fun enough with a G&T on a Sunday afternoon. 6/10"

        "content": "War Eagle-Probably the greatest guerrilla fighter in the world today.\r\n\r\nA Distant Trumpet is directed by Raoul Walsh and written by John Twist with the adaptation from Paul Horgan's novel by Richard Fielder & Albert Beich. It stars Troy Donahue, Suzanne Pleshette, William Reynolds, Diane McBain, Claude Akins & James Gregory. Max Steiner provides the musical score and William H. Clothier is the cinematographer.\r\n\r\n1883, Fort Delivery, Arizona, and newly posted Lieutenant Matthew Hazard (Donahue) is about to be thrust into two wars. One is of the heart, the other pits him against the last pocket of Indian resistance: the Chiricahua's, led by the mighty War Eagle.\r\n\r\nA blunderbuss \"A\" class production from Warner Bros that feels like a \"B\" class Oater from the 50s, A Distant Trumpet has much to recommend to the Western fan. Driven by a rousing cavalry themed score by Steiner, and beautifully photographed by Clothier around Red Rocks (New Mexico) & Painted Desert (Arizona) in Panavision/Technicolor, it's a film that carries a message and pays respect to the topic to hand. Without doubt the makers are keen to mark it out first and foremost as an adrenaline fuelled Cavalry Vs Indians based picture, with Walsh grandly staging the action sequence with skill (100s of extras/stunt men, no CGI here), but although the script could have done with some more work as regards the characterisations, the screenplay does make rich on the promise of adult themes. While the decision to let the Indian characters speak their own language is also a major bonus.\r\n\r\nWhere it falls down is three fold. Firstly is the problem of asking the average Donahue to carry the film, he may be easy on the eye to those so inclined, but his one note, expressionless, performance is often a distraction to the many splendours around him. Secondly is that the twin lovelies of McBain & Pleshette are underwritten and underused respectively, which in a film that's nearly two hours long (too long and that's the third point) is an act of stupidity. Some would argue that the love triangle sub-plot is an uneasy fit on context to the \"war\" at the film's core, but it does have value in regards to showing the point of view of the ladies marrying into the army way of life. Yes it should have been formed better, particularly from McBain's (yellow hair, yellow dress and vanilla ice cream skin) character's angle , but it does exist in the narrative and it's good to see.\r\n\r\nIt's far from the great swansong that Raoul Walsh deserved, but its pluses far outweigh the negatives. Be it battle orchestration (cliff top attack rules!), observing the thorn between two roses dynamic or just that it affords respect to the Indians, it's a film easily recommended to the genre fan. Besides which, Steiner and Clothier make it essential viewing. 7/10"

It's quite quickly paced and entertaining enough with pistols, pens, bows and arrows before a dunking in a swimming pool and a rather lame ending. The star for me was probably his wily assistant \"Nikki\" (Margaret Lindsay) who has the best of the dialogue and though it's all pretty forgettable, it's an OK watch for an hour."

Released in 1992, John (Cougar) Mellencamp plays a country star, Bud, who tries to come home to Indiana, bringing his tall blond wife (Mariel Hemingway) and daughter. Unfortunately, his dad's a total jerk (Claude Akins) and his high school sweetheart (Kay Lenz) is married to his brother and having an affair with someone linked to both. It seems like the star just wants to take a break from the show business and hang with his buds and family, like in the old days, but melancholy settles in and temptation strikes.\r\n\r\nWow, after seeing this my wife and I gave thanks for our dysfunctional families -- we never knew we had it so good!\r\n\r\nThis is a solid drama by first-and-only-time director Mellencamp. All the main players noted above do fine in their roles, but some of the side players are flat and unconvincing, like the bearded guy who works for Bud.\r\n\r\nThe first time I saw this movie I thought it was an okay drama, but I felt it was dragged down by the country star's mopiness, which is fundamental to the story -- I understand -- but it's still frustrating for the viewer. A couple of the key characters are a turn-off as well, but isn't this the way it is in real life? Noted critic Roger Ebert gave \"Falling from Grace\" his top rating and Gene Siskel also praised it, but Leonard Martin rated it a BOMB in his guide. The critics on Sneak Previews also dogged it. This just goes to show that \"Falling from Grace\" is a love-or-hate-it piece.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm somewhere in the middle, I enjoyed it a lot more on my second viewing and therefore lean toward the 'love it' side. It's a low-budget film that is better on repeat viewings. I Like the Seymour, Indiana, locations, which is John's actual hometown. The situations reflect real-life and there are some thematic gems to mine, like \"the sins of the father\" and the negative domino effect of unfaithfulness. I also like the way the movie ends.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Bud's wife, Alice, shares a great line: \"You can't have some secret world in your mind and another one on the street.\" Chew on that.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 100 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

        "content": "In many ways director Denny Tedesco's music documentary \"The Wrecking Crew\" serves as a personal valentine to his late father Tommy Tedesco, the greatly talented and innovative guitarist that was part of the legendary musical experience of skilled session musicians that provided the background sounds for many of the notable recording artists, television shows and films in the 1960's and early 1970's. Basically, the instrumental arrangements for these many performers that benefited from the dearly departed Tedesco and his fellow Crew members were infectious and influential sounds of artistry. \r\n\r\nThus, \"The Wrecking Crew\" tells the fascinating story of the committed musicians behind the scenes that did not get their share of the spotlight as did the celebrated artists that they provided their unique beats for unbeknownst to the majority of the public. Still, \"The Wrecking Crew\" can take pride in knowing that their contributions in pop cultural circles shaped the personalized soundtrack of a sometimes disillusioned generation hungry for moving and grooving to the tunes that promoted a certain level of comfort, creativity and consciousness. \r\n\r\nNaturally, Tedesco goes on to not only recognize his father's Tommy's prominence in \"The Wrecking Crew\" but is generous to gather the insights and exploratory opinions from his beloved old man's surviving collaborators whose rhythmic timing and individual gifts in music-making added to the extraordinary collective sounds that made \"The Wrecking Crew\" one of the mainly sought after instrumental bands to become so in demand when it came to churning out memorable and money-making compositions in the lucrative music business.\r\n\r\nThough a random round-table sit-down session, Tedesco allows the Crew members to voice their take on what made their personal contributions (both inside and outside of The Wrecking Crew's jam sessions) so impacting. The backbeats that were created clearly served as inspiration and permanent trademarks for some singers, musical groups and media productions that rose through the ranks based on The Wrecking Crew's devotion and proclivities for developing unique instrumental techniques and tactics. The discussions for the Crew members were not solely based on their musical musings but we get a glimpse into their private lives away from the brainstorming of music. Through archived pictures and recordings it is revealed that the ups and downs of family life, financial considerations, investments and other side projects all kept these remarkably resilient performers busy as they were making their mark professionally. \r\n\r\nBasically, The Wrecking Crew supplied what is commonly known as \"the West Coast Sound\" and the audience is immediately reminded about the involvement this small army of session musicians had with such big names as old-time artists such as Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby to revered 60's rock groups such as the revolutionary The Beach Boys and the popular The Monkees (The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson makes a cameo appearances as well as The Monkees' Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork). \r\n\r\nOf course other notable talking heads are assembled and gladly offer their assessment on how The Wrecking Crew shaped and embraced their singing careers along the way. Artists such as Cher, Glen Campbell, Nancy Sinatra and Herb Alpert all chime in for their singing praises of the Crew that took them to new heights in their careers. Also, music insiders and executives such as Dick Clark, Lou Adler and H.B. Barnum all recall The Wrecking Crew's glory days with spot-on recollections. Plus, the countless archived scenes for whom The Wrecking Crew was cozy with in their musical paths to royalty featured the images of Sammy Davis Jr., Phil Spector, Sam Cooke, Al Jardine from The Beach Boys, The Byrds, The Mamas and the Papas...just to name a few. \r\n\r\nStill, the ultimate rush in \"The Wrecking Crew\" is learning about some of the nostalgic television show that they had their hands in so creatively. From 60's television oldies that run a list of impressive boob tube memories that mention such fare as \"Bonanza\", \"Mission: Impossible\", \"The Monkees\", and \"Batman\" to later shows in the 70's for something like \"Dallas\", the Crew seemed to have had their fingerprints all over anything lyrically stimulating. \r\n\r\nThe interesting revelation pertaining to The Wrecking Crew's growing accomplishments is the fact that their musical achievements garnered Grammy Awards as well based on the countless recordings they put their distinctive stamp on with ferocity. \r\n\r\nWhen Tedesco focuses his camera on Crew members both relatively known to most (drummer Hal Blaine for instance) to the obscure ones (Earl Palmer, Al Casey, Bones Howe and Carol Kaye--the lone female representative of the group) we get a true sense of the pride, persistence and prosperity that these unsung artists have gone through as they knowingly participated in a musical movement meant to be rejoiced because their creative juices was the fabric that enriched our empty lives looking for escapist entertainment. \r\n\r\nCuriously, \"The Wrecking Crew\" was first made in 2008 but is now making the rounds in 2015. Although some viewers did not get to witness Tedesco's thoughtful and noteworthy on-screen affectionate acknowledgment to his gifted guitarist father and his equally productive Crew cohorts some seven-plus years ago the message is still the same then as it is now: the blast to the past in sound and spirit will remain refreshingly in tact courtesy of the legacy that the famed The Wrecking Crew left in its everlasting wake of numerous musical avenues too plentiful to count. \r\n\r\nThe Wrecking Crew (2008; re-released in 2015)\r\n\r\nLunchbox Entertainment\r\n\r\n1 hr. 41 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: various\r\n\r\nDirected by: Denny Tedesco\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG\r\n\r\nGenre: Documentary\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng (2015)"

It's quite possibly that Helen and Michael at their respective humane cores were a match made in cinematic heaven, but how come Dirty Weekend just feels dirty, lazy dirty at that, a sort of shock for shocks sake as Zahavi gets to curry favour with the feminist movement and Winner gets to be seedy, with murder death kill and the grotesque thrown in for good measure.\r\n\r\nPlot, for what it's worth, has dowdy Bella (Lia Williams) suddenly turn into a sexual vamp over night with a blood lust for offing all men who dare to leer and pester. In Brighton, the place of rock, candy floss and degenerate male members of the human race.\r\n\r\nIt would have been easy to root for Bella had she at the very least had acquaintances or drinks with some normal men, but it's hard to take seriously a film where every single bloke she meets is either troubled mentally, a sexually deviant, has a penchant for serial killing and etc etc. Even her best friend's husband is a milquetoast who probably should have been on Bella's hit list as well!\r\n\r\nWinner achieved everything he hoped for with Dirty Weekend, the critics frothed at the mouth, the British censors sharpened their scissors, and crucially the film became a holy grail of uncut home formats for the intrigued and degenerates. It undeniably was shocking back on release, I mean when the broad sheet newspapers of Blighty are dissecting it frame by frame you know it's a fire-cracker piece of cinema.\r\n\r\nRufus Sewell can be forgiven as this is right at the start of his career (he is edgy, nutty and Anthony Perkins like), same for British legend Sean Pertwee, but what is David McCallum's excuse, Ian Richardson also? That Lia Williams is bold and cheeky with her performance saves the film from stinker hell, it's great to note that she carved out a strong career in British TV and still works today.\r\n\r\nHard to recommend and guaranteed to make you angry, but fair play to Winner, boy did he know how to punch buttons! 5/10"

But as Jerry is about to find out, War has a knack of making or breaking a man...\r\n\r\nIt's not hard to see why \"The Fighting 69th\" was a very popular movie back on its release, coming out as America was about to enter WWII, the flag waving patriotism targeted its audience with gusto supreme and lashes of Irish sentiment. Furthering the cause was in having James Cagney in the critical lead role of Plunkett. Yet oddly, Plunkett is the made up character here, for the story is based on actual characters that the film wishes to honour. Father Duffy (Pat O'Brien) & Wild Bill Donovan (George Brent) being two highly respected men from this actual (and highly acclaimed) fighting unit.\r\n\r\nThe story follows a now well trodden path, brash cocky man learns lessons the hard way, is there to be redemption come the finale? Respect, bravery and indeed salvation are all given the once over by the makers here. There are few surprises but the film gets in there, does the job, and leaves without lingering either side of the good or bad fence. The direction from William Keighley is vigorous, and the supporting players are solid, if unspectacular (haven't we seen this O'Brien turn before?), but all and everything is second fiddle to the perfectly cast Cagney, bullish and stoic, his turn as Plunkett lifts the film above average, because without him the film would be instantly forgettable. 6.5/10"

Stewart Granger pops up as the captain of the ship that takes them (and James Mason) to France where they must work with the Resistance to get hold of some secret Nazi logistical deployments. When I say thriller, I really mean light comedy - the pace and the styles of acting are relaxed, there is absolutely no peril at all, and the ending - though slightly more action-packed than the rest of it - is a bit of a formality with explosions. What does work is the chemistry between the gents, and between Williams and Carla Lehmann (\"Michèle\") who introduces just the slightest hint of jeopardy. Herbert Lom and Karel Stepanek also chip in, adding some panache to the lightweight story and though it's borderline propaganda, to be honest, and a quarter of an hour too long, it's still an amiable outing for some decent talent."

It stars Barry Sullivan, Arlene Dahl, Jean Hagen, George Murphy, Richard Anderson and Moroni Olsen. Music is by Leith Stevens and cinematography by Harold Lipstein.\r\n\r\nSullivan plays Steve Keiver, an insurance lawyer unhappy with his rate of company advancement. He hits on the idea of being a middleman in deals to recover stolen property from the Mob, thus earning a nice pay off for himself whilst the insurance company are saved money by not having to pay out. But sure enough his actions attract police attention and before he knows it he is up to his neck in double-crosses, frames and dames!\r\n\r\nTone is set from the off as our protagonist is on the run from the police, it's a dimly lighted moist street and he begins his narration. From there we get the film flashback of how he has come to be a wanted man.\r\n\r\nWe are in noirville so obviously we have a bona fide femme fatale (Dahl smouldering) who is greedy, immoral, manipulative and thinks nothing of crushing Keiver's dreams. If he's to go to his doom then she really will not give it a second thought - and yet he loves her and would have married her in a heartbeat. He's a classic noir dope, he just can't see the bad in the woman he so covets, which is all the more annoying since the lovely firm secretary Joan Brenson (Hagen excellent) covets him and he can't see the wood for the trees where the two ladies are concerned.\r\n\r\nWe have a bunch of run of the mill villains, with one who has a kink involving how long he can hold his breath under water for, though we do get a robbery scene that comes to reveal some devilish cheek soon afterwards. The cops you kind of get miffed about since the whole scam that Keiver has set up is implausibly allowed to flourish. Yet when things go bad for Keiver later in the play, we enter a dark world, where even if the finale isn't pure film noir, we get some moody turns of events that softens any feelings of there being a damp squib at film's end. 7/10"

        "content": "Hopalong Cassidy: Western superhero (sorta)\r\n\r\n\"Gunfighter,\" aka \"Ballad of a Gunfighter,\" (1999) stars Chris Lybbert as Hopalong Cassidy in a story more akin to creator Clarence E. Mulford’s yarns than William Boyd’s films, although it’s really a marriage of both. The Bar 20 Ranch, where Hopalong’s babe (Adrienne Stout) and her uncle (Clu Gulager) reside, is raided by an embittered enemy (Louis Schwiebert) and his rustlers. Cassidy aims to get his girl back and set things a’right.\r\n\r\nThe movie poster proclaims in huge letters “Francis Ford Coppola presents” but, actually, Francis had nothing to do with the making of this picture; he didn’t even produce it. The film was written/directed by his nephew Christopher Coppola, who’s the brother of Nicolas Cage. Francis’ name (which was still revered in the industry in the late 90s) was attached to the movie simply to attract viewers, which worked with me because, otherwise, I would’ve never checked it out.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this is a very low-budget production, falling somewhere between the micro-budget of Glenn Ford’s last film, the made-for-Turner “Border Shootout” (1990), and the quality TV production “Purgatory” (1999), but closer to the former. If you can’t stomach the micro-budget vibe of Westerns like “Border Shootout,” I suggest skipping this.\r\n\r\nThat said, the flick has several highlights if you can acclimate. For instance, unlike the town-bound “Purgatory,” there are several scenes with a glorious Western backdrop. Also, Lybbert is stalwart as the noble gunfighter protagonist. It is stressed that he embraces limited pacifism, which only resorts to violence when absolutely necessary (as opposed to the idiotic total pacifism, which foolishly refuses to ever turn to violence, even when family members are threatened with murder or rape). \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Adrienne Stout is hot and formidable as Mary and Schwiebert is daunting as the resentful black hat antagonist, Tex. I also liked the story-within-a-story framework wherein Martin Sheen conveys the Hopalong tale to a dispirited minstrel played by Robert Carradine. Lastly, I appreciate how the tale mixes the mythical with the realistic and leaves you with a pleasant aftertaste, rather than sour.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 34 minutes and was shot in Elko, Nevada and Los Angeles, California. Johnny Rivers wrote the superb theme song “Ballad of a Gunfighter,” which plays over the end credits.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

        "content": "William Friedkin serves up Trailer Trash Neo-Noir with a side order of Fried Chicken. \r\n\r\nKiller Joe is directed by William Friedkin and adapted to screenplay by Tracy Letts from his own play of the same name. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Emile Hirsch, Juno Temple, Thomas Haden Church and Gina Gershon. Music is scored by Tyler Bates and cinematography by Caleb Deschanel. Plot finds Hirsch as Chris Smith, who because he is in severe debt to local thugs, hatches a plan to bump off his waster of a mother and claim the life insurance. Roping in the rest of his trailer dwelling family, he hires Killer Joe (McConaughey), a cop with a sideline in murder, but the Smith's have no idea just what price they will have to pay for his services.\r\n\r\nSo pulpy, so amusingly dark, Killer Joe is one of those films that will sit at the top of many film fan's best of lists for 2012. Yet if someone came up to me and declared it one of the worst then I certainly will understand. Undeniably it has no widespread appeal, you either get it or you don't, you will either laugh along with Friedkin and his dark observations or you will feel the whole thing is just too ugly to be entertainment. Man it's good to have Friedkin back pushing peoples buttons!\r\n\r\nFilmed in Texas in under three weeks, Killer Joe is a film that walks the fine line of misogyny and perversity for perversity's sake. But it never falls over that mark, even though these are scummy characters living in a scummy world, where there's sex and violence, and violent simulated sex and nudity; all of which is cloaked by a sweaty crime gone wrong caper. Much of the film is dialogue driven, rest assured this is very talky, but the director wrings out much tension and salaciousness from every character interaction, the slow-burn approach only heightening the sense of dread. When the finale comes, and it's a cracker-jack ending, there's an almost merciful release that it's all over. These are people you wouldn't want to hang out with ever, only there's Friedkin chuckling away to himself having made us spend an hour and forty minutes with this grime laden crew. If you feel like you need a bath afterwards, that's perfectly natural.\r\n\r\nFriedkin has garnered terrific performances from a top line cast. Hirsch (powder-keg), Church (naievity extraordinaire), Temple (virginal piggy in the middle) and Gershon (bold and suspicious), are all giving disturbing credibility to the material, but as good as they are they are trumped considerably by McConaughey. One of the most frustrating actors working today, much like Cage, a ream of poor movies adorn his CV, but once in a while he throws in a performance of such genuine quality that it begs to be acknowledged by his peers. Here as Killer Joe he lays on a Faust like menace, delivering his lines with clinically calm precision, yet still there's a glint in his eye, we know a black heart beats there but he can charm a snake out of its basket, a girl out of her underwear...\r\n\r\nUnflinching direction, bravura performances and neo-noir at its near best, one of the best films of 2012 so far. Well, to some of us at least.... 9/10"

I enjoyed the premise and the stakes that this movie provides, but writer Tracy Letts wrote this like it was some subversive wet dream of his as a teenager.\r\n\r\nThis movie is vial, there is so much unnecessary nudity from creepy changing room shots to women's genitals being presented in full view, to soft-core pornography in the climax of the movie. I understand that this movie is supposed to have no redeeming characters, but the graphicness takes away from the scene more than adds to them. It is very reminiscent of my complaint about Rob Zombie films.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, the performances here are incredible. Matthew McConaughey is amazing. McConaughey is cold, calculated, and downright terrifying in almost every scene he is in. The final twenty minutes of this film are spectacular. His discovery and reveal gave me goosebumps. I loved it. Thomas Haden Church is pretty great too, he is so stupid and pointless that he adds a bit of humor in intense scenes that makes the viewer guilty for laughing. Everyone else was okay, they filled their roles well but did not necessarily impress me.\r\n\r\nDespite my complaints, I enjoyed this film. It was an intense and thrilling experience that kept me on my toes till the credits rolled. I still think that the graphic nature and vulgarness take away from what could have been.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _67%_ | \r\n**Verdict:** _Good_"

What makes this one so much fun is the fact that this one absolutely revels in that atmosphere as there's a real abundance of it that just permeates the whole film. This one does it from the very beginning, hardly making its intentions subtle with the film-within-the-film opening and the ensuing dance number over the opening credits, although the fraternity members are also responsible for some more of this, as they continue to prank out the sorority throughout the beginning to some really funny moments. The sequence at the staff meeting starts out hilarious and soon becomes even more so, and from the boys’ opening prank to their hazing ritual and then onto the house pranks themselves all the way to the general atmosphere and tone this is barely a dent in the film's cheesiness. When it's not being funny, there are some good slasher moments as well including the early stalking in the sorority, the professor’s shocking encounter in the basement and the way that just about all the deaths occur during the party allows it to just be over-the-top fun. There's just a ton of action in that scene, as the killer gets going and seems to kill someone every five minutes and that just makes it seem all the more fast-paced as just about the entire cast is knocked off in rapid fashion and the great stalking and supernatural destruction throughout make it really exciting. The killer's costume itself is quite imposing, with the whole body hidden behind an ancient diving suit that is big and bulky, giving it the perfect creepy appearance. The best plus, though, is it's undeniably cheesy charm since there are a few problems with this one that comes up. The most glaring flaw here is the aforementioned cheesiness. While this is one of the film's best virtue, the fact that so much of it is quite silly does present it with some problems. The first is that the film jumps around in tone quite often and becomes a little disorienting at times. Another thing is that it stops the film cold to include these inserts and disrupt the flow of the film even more so. Though it produces one of the funniest gags, the staff meeting didn't need to be there, nor did the fraternity's adventures with the sorority. These just stop the film to include them and don't really contribute anything beyond some laughs, and could easily have been snipped. As well, the film features practically zero blood or gore and all of the kills are just bland and bloodless or carried out off-screen only to stumble upon them later which does take a lot of the sting out of the situation. The other big problem is that the ending is a little confusing. There's way too much happening and it becomes a little disorienting when it switches over to something else quite rapidly. Those are the film's real problems.\r\n\r\nRated R: Language, Violence, Nudity and drug use."

Sigh.\r\n\r\nPLOT\r\n\r\nThree college friends rush a sorority, and must survive a night in a house where an evil spirit has been awakened.\r\n\r\nMY THOUGHTS\r\n\r\nThe potential for the kills could have been good. But no. We don’t get to see the kills. They are mostly off screen and most of the kills are in the last twenty minutes or so. Not a lot of blood either. Though I did like the two fake out starts of the movie. We get to see some zombie-like action while a band is playing.\r\n\r\nActing isn’t that bad. The character that stands out the most for me is Sherry Willis-Burch (her only other horror movie is Final Exam) who plays Vivia, the horny, nerdy, and special effects friend. However, Joanna Johnson (known for nothing in horror and only for being in The Bold and the Beautiful) plays Jennifer, our supposed main character. She is the only one who seems hesitant to first pledge the sorority and then she doesn’t want to go into the house for the party.\r\n\r\nElaine Wilkes (known for just tv shows, nothing genre related) plays Phoebe the third friend who just kind of blends in with the other sorority sisters. Alicia Fleer (known for a couple of tv shows. Again, not genre related) plays Veronica, the mean girl, sorority sister. She at least dies by a trident stabbing.\r\n\r\nKiller Party starts with a horror movie playing, and then cuts to a couple making out in a car at a drive in theater. The girl stops him and goes off to get popcorn. She comes back to discover everyone is a zombie while a band is playing. This turns out to be a fake out. Another movie.\r\n\r\nWe learn three friends are rushing a sorority. The night of the initiation strange occurrences happen which turn out to be pranks. Soon it’s April 1st and their sorority is hosting an April Fool’s day party at that house. This time the pranks do go so well. As the night goes on the tricks are not pranks. Something is killing the party goers. Who will survive? Who is killing everyone?\r\n\r\nKiller Party suffers one of the worst crimes of an 80’s slasher: Being boring and the kills are mild, off screen. And you pretty much can figure out who the killer is before the end of the movie. For me, I was really only rooting for one character and I shouldn’t have rooted for anyone. If you’re bored and you like slashers you can put this on while doing other things. Just go in with low expectations."

Be warned that the rest of this review contains a few spoilers if you have not watched the movie before reading this.\r\n\r\nThe movie begins quite well. I liked Wolverine getting into that bar taking revenge on the idiot hunting bears with poisoned darts. Then it did not continue so well. My main issue is that they screw with Wolverines healing powers really early on in the movie so that he is handicapped for a good chunk of it. I really did not like that. Now this does not stop there from being quite a few cool action sequences. The fight sequence on the Japanese bullet train was quite cool although a wee bit too drawn out perhaps.\r\n\r\nEventually he manages to get his powers back although the happiness does not last very long. In the final combat they actually deprive Wolverine of his adamantium claws and it doesn’t look like he gets those back. What the f… is that? Sure, he regrows his original bone claws but that is not the same thing. Wolverine should have his adamantium claws, full stop. This is something I really dislike with a lot of Hollywood producers and directors now. They feel that they have to create some shock effect by destroying icons and constants in the world of movie fantasy. Like blowing up the Enterprise over and over again. I just hate it and for me this is the one thing that really stops this from being a great movie. Either they somehow give him back his proper claws or they can just as well make a reboot as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nIt is quite sad that they, I will not say ruined but at least, diminished the movie in this way. Otherwise it would have been a great movie. It has a lot of nice action, a not too bad script and Hugh Jackman is very good as Wolverine. Actually the only one I thought was somewhat si so is Dr Green who’s acting is rather pathetic.\r\n\r\nAll in all a good and entertaining movie that could have been a lot better if it was not for the Hollywood dimwits who felt they had to put something shocking in it and screwed it up."

Many years later, that solider - \"Yashida\" (Hal Yamanouchi) - has become a wealthy and successful industrialist determined to leave his fortune to his strong-willed and capable granddaughter \"Mariko\" (Tao Okamoto). It's soon clear, though, that that succession plan is going to face it's problems - not least from her own father \"Shingen\" (Hiroyuki Sabada) and the Yakuza replete with their own group of combat-ready mutants. When an attempt is made to kidnap the woman at the old man's funeral, \"Logan\" (Hugh Jackman) gets more than he bargained for - and is now faced with a dilemma the like of which he had hitherto thought impossible. Moreover, this development actually puts both him and his charge at considerable risk. The plot takes a further twist when they both discover that there may yet be an even more dangerous foe awaiting them. Though this looks good, the story is weak and the characterisations all largely undercooked as the emotional undercurrents for \"Logan\" - still reeling from his loss of \"Jean Grey\" - drags the story into a mire of sentiment that makes this actually quite heavy going at times. As with the \"Origins\" film (2009) the nature of his battle skills require much too much close quarter and repetitive combat scenes that, after a while - and after he has, for the umpteenth time, emerged from a battle against overwhelming odds without breaking a nail - become jaded and dull to watch. The denouement scenes here seem to go on interminably, but without any sense of jeopardy - we all know what is going to happen and no amount of acrobatics and pyrotechnics makes that inevitability any more exciting to watch. Jackman himself is nowhere near his best here, either - it is almost as if he is as tired of this role as I am now. The supporting cast do little more than make up the numbers and though it's watchable enough, I did struggle and seriously hope we will see no more of these en-seul efforts."

Gordon Griffith has something of the wonder about him as the child, and Elmo Lincoln the capable, honourable adult. The pace is consistent and the fight scenes quite realistic looking (plenty of gymnastics) - and if you are at all interested in the development of cinema, as well as of this oft told story, then this is well worth 70 minutes of your time. Helpfully, the inter-titles don't get in the way of the acting; they are there - but sparingly."

That's the way I felt after watching 'Death Warmed Up', from my now-infamous Mill Creek 50-film 'Nightmare Worlds' pack--it has a few interesting ideas, and some decent, though dated, atmosphere, but director Blyth doesn't know how to put it all together. In the right hands, this could have worked, but it definitely doesn't, and that's a shame, because it had potential...'it coulda been a contender!'\r\n\r\nThe two young female leads that play Sandy and Jeannie are beautiful, there's good chemistry between them and the two male leads, particularly in the scene where they're on the ferry going to the island. The completely gratuitous nudity and softcore sex was a great bonus. In an interview that was a DVD extra for 'The Fog', Jamie Lee Curtis explained that she enjoyed starting out in horror and that it was a useful genre for an actor in that it gave one a wide range of possible behaviours to both utilize and show, and, by the end, Michael and Sandy proved to me they were good actors. It's just too bad they were in a nondescript, clunky script that had no idea what it was doing or where it was going. 'Death Warmed Up' is one of those films that doesn't have a climactic finale, or end, per se, it just simply stops or dies, as if the filmmakers simply had no ideas left and simply stopped when they ran out of film.\r\n\r\nTHIS is the type of film that should be remade, not the wildly successful and great film that has no need to have a different interpretation or chance at life, but the misfires or the should-have-beens--to show the world that these ideas had validity and meaning after all."

When young \"Ronnie\" returns home having been expelled from the Naval Academy, accused of forgery, his father is quickly convinced of the young man's integrity and innocence. This is not just a proud father's belligerence, but a determination on behalf of this upstanding and principled man \"Arthur\" (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) to see his son gets justice. To that end, he alights on the renowned barrister and parliamentarian \"Sir Robert Morton\" (Robert Donat) to raise the issue in Parliament - it was not possible to seek ordinary legal redress for the lad as it would have meant effectively suing the King which was a big taboo! What now ensues is a well delivered story of right and wrong, of sacrifice and of love. Donat features sparingly really, but when he appears his delicate charm and subtle means of engaging with the camera speak volumes that, coupled with Rattigan's own adaptation of his play and with a solid cast including the always reliable Kathleen Harrison, Basil Bradford and Margaret Leighton create a potent look at just how effective the little man can be, when given the right impetus and a proper champion. It's not devoid of humour, either - usually at the hands of the gramophone-wielding, rather foppish \"Dickie\" (Jack Watling) who is happily wasting £200 a year at university with all the academic acumen of a toadstool. Just shy of two hours, it really does motor along well and though the ending is maybe a little bit rushed, it's provides an interesting character study of a family life that must adapt and even struggle to do what is right.

This allows Gargamel, the Naughties, the Smurfs and the humans (part time) to focus on her so the movie is chiefly Smurf focused, even though (as specifically discussed in the movie) Smurfette and the Naughties aren't technically the same as the others.  (This is arguable, as it is possible all Smurfs are magically created.)\r\n\r\nThe messages of inclusion and togetherness and family are actually a lot stronger in this movie than the first, as well as the level of goofiness from Gargamel, to include his celebrity status.\r\n\r\nI think I'm just not a fan of this movie series, but clearly the movies did good enough to warrant their production value."

Rejected, he stokes ill-feeling against the girl amongst their puritanical, superstitious, villagers, and a tragiedy ensues. Powell and Pressberger live up to their reputation with this beautifully shot effort - the colours and costumes, and the exterior countryside scenes are terrific. The acting is less impressive. We know that Farrar lusts after the girl, but his actual performance gives little evidence of that. Owen Holder provides us with a rather distracting narration that doesn't add anything at all - and there is quite a bit of padding to draw out to the story - pretty to look at most of the time, but frequently slowing it down to a snail's pace. Dame Sybil Thorndike is quite good as the girl's disapproving mother-in-law, and there are couple of nice contributions from Hugh Griffith and George Cole to help it along, but somehow this production hasn't quite got the momentum to sustain it well. It may well be that Selznick edited the heart (and soul) out of it when he saw it, but in any case this isn't one of the Archers' more memorable efforts."

        "content": "_Well, maybe ordinary people see things differently than nations do._\r\n\r\n**Original Japanese Version**\r\n\r\nThe Last War is most definitely a film of two distinct halves, the first is an increasingly serious anti-nuclear war film that showcases the true despair of humanity when faced with total annihilation ripe with horror, the other is an increasingly melodramatic, cheesy and sappy family drama about living in ignorance about their situation.\r\n\r\n16 years have passed since the end of World War II, and Japan has achieved rapid recovery. Mokichi Tamura works as a driver for a press centre, hoping for happiness for his family. His daughter, Saeko, is in love with a merchant, Takano, who has been at sea for a long time. When he returns, the young couple agrees to get married with the consent of Saeko's father. Meanwhile, tensions between the Federation and the Alliance build, especially after an intelligence-gathering vessel is captured. A new Korean War breaks out across the 38th parallel, with the Federation and Alliance drawn into the war... what could turn out to be the very last.\r\n\r\nThe Last War has been on my watchlist for a while but I've only ever found increasingly low-quality versions online, so I settled for a fansubbed upload. It was marginally better visually although suffered from the occasional frozen picture and had to wait a few moments for it to restart again. A damn shame since this film is truly gorgeous in places, director Shûe Matsubayashi truly excels here and paints too many frames which envoke a beautiful emotional weight.\r\n\r\nIt's a tough watch by the end and ultimately a career-defining film for Eiji Tsuburaya and Tsuburaya productions. Easily one of his best works in terms of visual effects with the nuclear devastation that ends the film shining the most; Visually arresting, it's an incredibly visceral and terrifying sequence of events with images that become nightmarishly abstract at times. All made that much more effective thanks to the matte work of Fuchimu Shimakura, it's unnervingly beautiful.\r\n\r\nWhile the film struggles for the majority of its runtime to balance its two halves effectively it's the final act where it all culminates in a true heart wrenching emotional core that I wish the rest of the film had carried. But nonetheless a strong showing from frequent Toho tokusatsu writer Takeshi Kimura.\r\n\r\nWhile Akira Takarade gives a truly excellent performance in this movie, it's with the film's protagonist portrayed by Frankie Sakai where the film truly shines and his last moments in the film are delivered with such conviction that it makes for an already increasingly despairing film even harder to watch with his character's cold acceptance of his impending demise. The English speaking actors do a great job and populate quite a lot of this film but the two languages blend together exceedingly well to create a film that can span multiple cultures with ease.\r\n\r\nThe music by Ikuma Dan is as excellent as the film's visuals, Dan's music perfectly encapsulates the utter hopelessness in the face of nuclear armageddon with a very uplifting call to arms with our protagonist's actions. I could see myself easily listening to this score outside of the film it was that good.\r\n\r\nOverall, despite my grievances with the film, The Last War is a grim reminder of what could be if the world continues on its current path. Glad I finally got the chance to watch this.\r\n\r\n_We made each other very happy... we always will._"

Via a series of regulations and eventually law the Jewish are persecuted then ultimately banished. Thereupon, their chickens come home to roost; their city collapses into chaos and the Jews are invited to return - very much on their own terms. The futility and short-sightedness of a \"blame culture\" is writ large. Personally, I didn't see this as a precursor of the Holocaust; though I can see how the polarised vision of Jewish faith and ethics could certainly provide the oxygen ultimately required for such irrational hatred. It also served to remind me of the huge talents of the musicians who provided the accompaniments to many films like this."

We normally do not have Canal+ in our “bouquet” but they are making a drive right now so everyone can watch Canal+ for a couple of weeks and this movie looked interesting, at least compared to the rest of the choice available that evening, so we watched it.\r\n\r\nIt was a surprisingly entertaining evening movie. It is pretty much a standard Hollywood nonsensical pop-corn movie but it is a well done one. It makes no pretence of being anything else than it is. The story is a fairly predictable action story. Hero gets framed during the introduction scenes. Quick flip to the space prison that is going to serve as the scenery of the bulk of the movie. Dumbass thinks he is more clever than everyone else so he breaks the rules. Goes bad. Prisoners break out. President’s daughter just happens to be there at the same tame. Our hero is sent in to save the day. Action time!\r\n\r\nThere are a few more complications to the story but that is pretty much it. It is a simple and solid story that pretty much holds water. It would have been a fairly standard, even mediocre, movie if it was not for our hero which is doing an admirable job of playing hero and tough guy. The dialog, as nonsensical as it is, definitely lifts the move. The action is fairly good and so are the special effects although it is by no means a movie that is held up by its effects. The main bad guy is a really irritating psychotic son-of-a-bitch. The actor is doing a good job of portraying him but the character itself bugged the hell out of me when watching the movie. He is a bit over the top that has to be said.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the movie was quite entertaining as an evening pop-corn flick and since we picked it more or less by chance and did not know much about it before hand it was indeed a fairly pleasant surprise."

That anyone could enjoy such a derivative, tongue-in-cheek, low ambition piece of schlock, is surely cause for venomous spleen venting from the serio film brigade. They call them guilty pleasures, but thing is, I just don't feel guilty about having such a wonderfully fun filled great time with the Luc Besson produced Lockout.\r\n\r\nPlot? Well it's the future and basically Guy Pearce (Snow) is wrongly convicted of a crime and sentenced to do stir in stasis until whenever. But up in space at the MS1 prison facility, home to all the maniacs found in \"Demolition Man\", the president's daughter, do-gooder babe Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace), is suddenly taken captive and it's a big hostage situation. This looks like a mission for a serious hard bastard type! Well \"Snake Plissken\" wasn't available, so they get Snow, who is bulked up, full of wise cracks and has a point to prove. Guess what follows? Yep, complete popcorn frenzy as Pearce and Grace cut a swathe through MS1 and have a date with coolness personified.\r\n\r\nOn the way, via a truly gorgeous sci-fi affected Blu-ray print, we will tick off the homages and influences and compare notes with our viewing partners about how it's a \"Snake Plissken\" movie but with Shane Black type dialogue. While those who are partial to a bit of sci-fi design are well served here. Because even though there might be the worst CGI effects ever during a chase scene (that mercifully only runs for 50 seconds), the space ships, sets and Torsion System sequence, prove that you don't need Michael Bay type bucks to please the eyes. From the quite brilliant and hilarious opening interrogation beat down, to the big reveal and punch line, this Besson produced piece is serving popcorn with a smile to a certain segment in the film watching populace.\r\n\r\nWith bits of the \"Snake Plissken\" movies, \"Fortress\", \"Die Hard\", \"Commando\", \"Demolition Man\", \"Minority Report\", \"Last Boy Scout\" and any other quip laden dude/wronged man on a mission movie, Lockout clearly lacks originality. But seriously! Was anyone involved playing it as anything other than a sly homage movie? No, they wasn't. Pearce is great fun in the role, but he isn't trying to worry the highbrow crowd's votes for films of the year. Anyone viewing it expecting something cerebral should feel more guilty than those who stand up to say they had a great time watching it. Ingem Ferem. 7/10"

        "content": "Joshua Marston, best known as the director of drug mule story MARIA FULL OF GRACE, gives us here a poignant depiction of blood feuds in northern Albania. The script was cowritten by Andamion Murataj, the film was shot on location, and the actors are all Albanians, some of them amateurs, speaking the authentic Gheg dialect of their region.\r\n\r\nNik (Tristan Halilaj) is in his last year of high school and dreams of opening an internet/computer game café in his small town. His sister Rudina (Sindi Lacej) hopes to go on to university. Their dreams are dashed, however, when their father (Refet Abazi) kills a neighbour in a dispute over land. To avoid revenge attacks from the dead man's family, the males of the family are forced to stay inside their home at all times, a situation that could last for years while the community mediates the feud. With the father out of work, Rudina is forced to drop out of school, deliver a bread route, and buy contraband cigarettes to sell at a profit.\r\n\r\nMarston and his cowriter are clearly interested in depicting the intersection of two worlds in Albania: mobile phones and cheap motorbikes alongside ancient laws that hold a man's honour sacred. What weakens the film, however, is that nowhere is it made clear that blood feuds are not a typical feature of contemporary Albanian life: while they briefly erupted in the early 1990s after the fall of Communism, and some families still live under them, it is very unusual for one to start today. Without mentioning that things have changed, this film misrepresents Albania and misleads Western viewers towards a Boratish caricature.\r\n\r\nNote how other reviews here and elsewhere tend to commend the film more for \"teaching them something about Albania\" than for cinematography or acting. The camerawork is completely unimaginative, lacking any carefully composed tracking shots and depending far too often on a seasick shaky handheld camera following a walking actor. While the acting isn't outright bad, the deficiencies in the script only make their amateur effort stand out. While life for the men in the family is tedious as they can't step out of the house, this point is already sufficiently made by halfway through the film, and yet the script goes on and on without anything more to say. The ending seems ad hoc and doesn't really follow from the body of the film."

I had no clue concerning this movie until we watched it. It turned out be an enjoyable movie evening. This is a well done movie indeed although I felt like it could have been an even better movie at the end.\r\n\r\nActing, scenery, general story is all quite good. Well the story is okay. It is not exactly ground breaking but rather a standard bootlegging kind of story. The new deputy is a real asshole to the extent of being somewhat unbelievable. Guy Pearce plays the role well though. That goes for the rest of the main cast as well. It is a well-acted movie.\r\n\r\nIt kind of drags on a bit though. The real action where they finally take on the asshole deputy is not until the very end of the movie. Okay, that is perhaps understandable but until then the movie is quite slow. I would not have minded to see both the older Bondurant brothers being a bit more into the action but instead we mostly follow Jack (Shia LaBeouf) on his various more or less silly escapades and romantic adventures which, not very surprisingly, ends up with him leading previously mentioned asshole deputy right to their illegal booze factory…sigh! I am not 100% convinced that you can survive having your throat cut by the way. I think that was rather silly.\r\n\r\nIt is a good movie and of a lot higher quality than most although perhaps not exactly my style of movie and I have to say that I thought the ending, with Forrest blundering into the frozen lake, was rather meh. Still, it is worth 6 out o10 stars but not more as far as I am concerned."

It is not at all a bad movie. I do prefer the “shot everything that moves and when it doesn’t move anymore shot some more just to be sure” type of zombie movies but I still quite enjoyed this one. The words “romantic” and “zombie” is of course two words that you really would never expect to see in the same sentence. Surprisingly enough it does indeed work in this movie.\n\nI think my main enjoyment of this movie was the voice-over with R’s thoughts though. At times it is incredibly funny. The actual story, that the zombies’ magically starts to heal themselves is of course pretty nonsensical but you do not really watch zombie movies for their elaborate plot anyway. I have seen worse and this was not really supposed to be a horror-zombie movie anyway so I can live with that.\n\nThis is the first zombie-movie that I have watched where you actually see the story from the zombies perspective. Another thing that, surprisingly enough, worked quite well. The voice-overs helped a lot to make that happen.\n\nThe special effects are fairly low key for being a zombie movie but I would say that they are just about right for this movie. The “bonies” are the most monster-like ones in the movie and their make-up is quite cool. Unfortunately their movements are quite stiff and look decidedly computer generated. That is a shame and pretty much the only complaint I have concerning the actual implementation of this movie.\n\nUnless you are totally allergic to zombies I would recommend watching this movie. I would especially recommend it if you are not normally into zombie movies. You are likely to be surprised."

Worse, the researchers at the facility use him as a guinea pig in their experiments. Havoc ensues.\r\n\r\n“Blood Freak” (1972) is an indie creature feature on a miniscule budget with bad acting and a ridiculous monster. On the positive side, manly Steve Hawkes is charismatic as the Presley-inspired protagonist; it’s the peripheral actors who are lousy, like the scientists at the farm.\r\n\r\nThe flick scores well on the female front, but I would’ve preferred that Heather Hughes (Angel) had a bigger roll. Dana Cullivan is a’right as the raven-haired seductress though. (There’s also an alluring blonde with a small part).\r\n\r\nInterestingly, director Brad Grinter appears periodically to offer philosophical commentary while smoking. His final scene reveals a droll angle. The theme is anti-drug and, surprisingly, pro-biblical with well-written insights from the Scriptures amidst the madness.

        "content": "The Words obliquely poses the question, what would have happened if someone had found the suitcase full of Papa Hem’s manuscripts that Hadley lost at the Gare de Lyon, and published the con-tent as his own work?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the answer is: not much. The problem, or one of them, is that the movie establishes too long a period of time between the loss of the manuscript — shortly after the end of WWI — and its publishing — presumably, the then-present day.\r\n\r\nAs we all know, Hemingway eventually got over the incident and went on to become arguably the greatest author of the 20th century, essentially rendering the film’s premise moot.\r\n\r\nCo-directors Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal’s script, however, conveniently has its homologous character, played by Ben Barnes as a Young Man and Jeremy Irons as an old nurseryman, give up writing forever following his soon-to-be ex-wife’s misplacement of his text.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this is the least hemingwayesque thing to have done. Here’s another couple of problems. Wannabe writer Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper) finds the briefcase in an antiques store in Paris, and buys it; lo and behold, not only is the manuscript still inside, un-touched — from the Gare de Lyon in the 1920s to an antiques shop in the 2010s, the briefcase sure-ly must have exchanged hands often (now, there’s you film), and yet it didn’t occur to anyone to rifle through it on the odd chance that it might contain something of value —, but Rory actually leaves it untouched (\"He retyped every word as it was written on those pages. He didn't change a pe-riod, a comma, or even correct the spelling mistakes\"), which doesn’t stop from going directly to the printing press.\r\n\r\nIt’s at this point that one yearns for a movie like Genius, about famed editor Max Perkins — who worked with the likes of Scott Fitzgerald, Thomas Wolfe, and Hem himself; even an Ernest Hemingway at the peak of his powers wouldn’t crap out a best-seller just like that, and it certainly wouldn’t hit bookstore shelves without undergoing extensive rewrites and editing work.\r\n\r\nBut I digress. The Old Man (who, again, lacks the testicular fortitude of both Papa and the character to which his moniker is a reference) recognizes his work and confronts Rory — but don’t expect anything along the lines of Secret Window; the Old Man \"just thought [Rory] should know the story behind these stories in case anyone was to ask.\"\r\n\r\nThis comes right after the Old Man admits \"I don't know how you did it. To be brutally honest, I don't care.\" But if he doesn’t care, and he clearly ne-ver did, why should we? Why even bother?\r\n\r\nThe whole thing becomes even less urgen when we consider that the Old Man’s tale is only a story within Rory’s story, which in turn is a story within another story: the latest book by novelist Clay Hammond (Dennis Quaid), who is discussing it with literary groupie Daniella (Olivia Wilde). Enough to make you wonder if there’s a point to any of this drivel, and if so, what the hell it is.\r\n\r\nPS. That Rory’s adventure is a fictional yarn — which might be based on events in Hammond’s life, and then again it might not — could explain that he and the Old Man live in a world where Hemingway existed (a copy of The Sun Also Rises makes a cameo, being read by the Young Man), but neither ever stops to consider for the briefest moment that their little mix-up is eerily similar to one of the best known anecdotes in Western literature."

It stars Eddie Marsan, Candese Reid, Tom Sturridge and Romola Garai. Story has Marsan as Frank, an alcoholic ex-soldier suffering nightmares over an incident that saw him shoot a young mother. Frank strikes up an unlikely friendship with Lynette (Reid), a homeless girl sleeping rough on the streets. Once barriers are broken down, Frank takes Lynette into his home to stay, but it's not long before Lynette's drug dealing boyfriend comes a calling...\r\n\r\nFor the most part Junkhearts is a very gritty slice of British miserablism. The pic is populated by addicts and wannabe gangsters, in a part of London built of dingy concrete council abodes, and where single promiscuous moms struggle to keep a grip on their lives.\r\n\r\nDirector Krishnan suffered herself from PTSD, so she was on hand to ensure the great Marsan could do the role justice, while there's a refreshing street believability about young Reid's performance. The camera work is intense and deliberately intruding, with the sound work being hypnotic to add bleaker tones to the characterisations. \r\n\r\nThe harshness and hurts of addiction rings true here, as does the key betrayal plot line and the breakdown of Frank. Unfortunately the parallel plot line featuring Romola Garai undermines the grit and grime surrounding Frank and Lynette's world, and it sadly serves only to give the pic a somewhat disappointing ending. Whilst the introduction of gun and knife crime appraisals don't strike the requisite powerful chords.\r\n\r\nYet even with its flaws this is still an intense film, with Marsan on top form and some other technical smarts on show, it's well worth a look by anyone interested in a slice of some moody British underbelly. 7/10"

We know that \"Lady Elizabeth\" (Barbara Everest) has lost her precious emerald brooch, and that she suspects her ne'er-do-well nephew \"John\" (George Leigh) of pinching it. He denies the accusation when he finds her searching his room with \"Priscilla\" (Evelyn Ankers) and storms out of the house. Next morning, the old bat is found dead and, naturally, \"John\" is prime suspect. Thing is though - he has an alibi, and it's the police who are providing it! He spent that very night face down in a cell recovering from too much Scotch. So, who did pinch the jewel and who murdered the old lady? That detection falls to Scotland Yard's finest \"Trent\" (Richard Fraser) who has to get to the bottom of things. It's not that simple to guess who did what to whom, but boy is there a lot of dialogue as the film progresses, taking us through quite a few unsavoury and devious characters - any one of whom might have done her in. The production is cheap and cheerful and the acting pretty static, but the story moves along well enough for an hour and though it's entirely forgettable, it's still not a bad watch."

For me, growing up watching James Best as Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane in 'The Dukes of Hazzard', it was intriguing to watch him here, as a priest selected as one of 4 paid volunteers for an experiment supposedly run by the ECC, an environmental organization. It ends up that it's just a cover to test an experimental mind-control 'Brain Machine' that the U.S. government  wants, in order to keep it's citizens in line, in the name of 'keeping social order'. Admittedly, when one of the directors says that the future is surveillance, I couldn't help but shudder at the parallels to society today, in this post-9/11 era. Unfortunately, the more time that passes, the closer these Orwellian cinematic views of civilization and its discontents come to mirroring the way life has become.\r\n\r\nNo spoilers, but the machine forces the person to tell the truth. Growing up, I have learned that honesty is not always the best policy. In fact, life has to endure the 'little white lie' in order to have things run peacefully. While no cinematic masterwork, this film more than suffices as Exhibit A for evidence. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you can handle 1970's, TV-movie-style filmmaking."

There's an effective contribution from George Hayes as the \"Mad Artist\" who has taken over the home of the victim - a role he plays, briefly, with some skill.

In her only cinematic appearance, Julia Theresa Russell, who was the director's sister-in-law, deserves mention, however. She's gorgeous and her acting wasn't bad at all. The jazz/blues/spiritual score on the Criterion Collection release, I believe by Wycliffe Gordon, is outstanding. Recommended if you like either silent films or Paul Robeson."

        "content": "In the early 1950s, 20th Century Fox invited Samuel Fuller to make a picture in Brazil about a jaguar hunter (John Wayne was tipped for the role) falling in love with a woman (Ava Gardner) he helps to rescue as she flees through the jungle with her cowardly husband. Fuller headed for Brazil to make a preliminary study and settled in a village of the indigenous Karaja tribe. He scouted locations, shot some footage of local nature and customs, and discovered some elements that he might work into the screenplay. In the end, however, the whole project came to naught when insurance companies refused to provide coverage for a shoot in what was then a remote and potentially dangerous part of the world.\r\n\r\nIn Mika Kaurismäki's 1992 documentary, TIGRERO: A Film that was Never Made, Sam Fuller returns to the same village he based himself in four decades before. American indie filmmaker Jim Jarmusch tags along as the interlocutor to which Fuller recounts the whole Hollywood story and comments on how rural Brazil has changed since his first visit. Jarmusch is also interested in the culture of the Karaja, taking photographs of the village (some of which are included as extras in the DVD release) and narrating in voiceover some of their traditions and practices. The downside of this is that the duo talk about the Karaja according to the noble savage stereotype, depicting them as an idyllic people without a care in the world, and the film never confronts the challenges they might have faced now as modernity arrives, or forty years ago when life was no bed of roses either.\r\n\r\nThe film has an inauspicious beginning, where Jarmusch asks Fuller in Rio de Janeiro why he's there, and it's obvious that this whole (very stilted) dialogue is scripted. Once they subsequently reach the Karaja village, their chats seem more real. The first thing they do in the village is project the footage that Fuller he had shot forty years before to the locals. The Karaja are amazed to see their long-dead relatives and friends. As one Karaja explains the visceral impact that this film footage had on him, Fuller tells him “That’s called emotion,” the same cinematic creed he professed in his cameo role in Godard's Pierrot Le Fou.\r\n\r\nFuller is a funny character. He was already around 80, a wizened old man that seems only about half the height of Jarmusch, but he’s full of energy and enthusiasm for this adventure. He appears almost invariably with a cigar in his mouth and a baseball cap and talks in this really old-timey New York Jewish accent. I honestly found him hard to understand at points, it's like watching someone speaking Elizabethan English step out into the world of 1992.\r\n\r\nTIGRERO doesn't seem a major achievement in documentary filmmaking, and after one viewing I don't feel in a hurry to ever see it again. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable 75 minutes and I appreciated learning something about this part of the world."

It's certainly watchable and is in no way as bad as reviews tend to give it. This is Jack Conrad's filmmaking debut, but it's not a monstrosity. After negotiations with Jeff Bridges and Robert Blake broke down for the main part of Bobby Lee, Conrad was forced to play the role himself, and he's no embarrassment. Though it tends to be ridden with cliché, and the main characters are extremely unintelligent in their bank-robbing and getaway approaches, it's still a fun ride and worth checking out if you have the opportunity."

On it are the names of various men she knew - to varying degrees - back when she was a debutante attending a ball. She decides to track these men down and the film follows her as she tries to evaluate whether or not she married the right man, encountering each and considering where her (and their) future may have led had events played out differently. It also becomes apparent that these men, too, have found their lives impacted on by their relationship at the time with her. Some of their stories are tragic, some satisfying, some entertaining: we have a hen-pecked local mayor, a recluse, a priest, an hairdresser - who might not have proved to be her cup of tea, anyway. What \"Christine\" gradually comes to realise is that regret and wishful thinking are a two way street, and the poignancy of her journey is well encapsulated at the end when she meets a young man, much the same age as she was when her card was being filled. Bell is really effective here, she plays the role with nuance and an endearing charisma especially as she begins to realise the reciprocal effects of the characters' behaviour when they were all around sixteen years old. The dialogue is also quite well written with a degree of humour, frankness and realism that helped ensure director Julien Duvivier could sustain what might otherwise have been rather a long, and episodic, 2½ hours. This is an engaging lifetime retrospective that takes it's time and, I suspect, will leave us all with our own choice of whom she ought to have married (if anyone of them)."

I can definitely appreciate this, but it seems that all attention has been placed here, on the form.\r\n\r\nThe acting, and actors, fit well here... on the stage. They all act as if they were on a stage, which is fitting. In fact, to be honest, I would have much preferred to see this as a live performance on stage, than here. The story simply drowns in all these costumes and colours, fake trains and stages.\r\n\r\n_Last words... a good story is more important than anything else. A good story doesn't have to be complicated (just take a look at a movie such as Locke, which is centered around many of the same themes as this). A good story was not important to these people, they just wanted to play around with fancy costumes, beautiful sets and actors who exaggerate. I would surely have skipped this one... had I known._"

        "content": "The great irony of Cesare deve morire is that, while the conspirators who assassinated Julius Caesar ostensibly did so in hopes of freedom and found only death, the prisoners who stage a performance of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar in this film are able to set themselves free through the liberating power of storytelling – at least until the curtain falls.\r\n\r\nThe movie certainly takes its own liberties, shot documentary-style in a “high-security prison” where the guards are invariably conspicuous by their absence – though one of the best scenes has a trio of them materializing briefly to debate whether Antony is “obliging” or “a son of a bitch” –, and the inmates get along famously except for a quick quarrel which is resolved off-screen (once again without the guards’ intervention).\r\n\r\nAnd yet Cesare was filmed in Rome's Rebibbia prison – which at one time counted the guy who tried to kill Pope JP2 among its tenants –, and stars actual prisoners serving long sentences for murder, drug trafficking, and other offenses (the one who plays the title role actually looks like a real-life Tony Soprano); this is the soft underbelly of hardened criminals.\r\n\r\nThe film’s secondary irony is that the black-and-white, ‘behind-the-scenes’ rehearsals provide a richer background setting – the highlight being the funeral oration scene delivered from the prison courtyard – than the mostly bare stage where the play proper takes place (although the Battle of Philippi – that is, what we see of it – is quite the spectacle); accordingly, the former is devoted the bulk of the economical 75-minute running time."

Robinson is a successful advertising executive - but his methods prove just a little too much for his bosses, so they send him to their British office where he quickly engages with the \"Duke\" (Nigel Bruce) and his \"Duchess\" (Constance Collier) and is soon knee deep in a cunning plan to exploit some ostensibly worthless land owned by the penniless aristocrat - but land that contains the wonder metal \"mangalite\" - a substance that could make them all gazilionaires. He is not the only one after this, though - he has to compete with the shrewd \"Manningdale\" (Ralph Richardson). Bruce steals this for me - his appearances are infrequent, but his bumbling decency is the perfect foil for the brash American and the story has an uplifting feel to it. The production is a bit basic, and it does play a little too much to stereotype - but it's still an enjoyable outing for all concerned that is well worth a watch."

While Chill Wills pops in for a dandy performance to please the Western faithful.\r\n\r\nLeticia Roman is a token lady offering, the resolution is a bit of a damp squib, but Walker, Wills and Moore are darn fine company to be in, which in this case is enough to make time spent with this movie time well spent. 6.5/10"

Therein, are eight cadets who essentially adopt the roles of the Montagues and Capulets - but with a difference. All are male. Using an hybrid of Shakespeare's own language and a modern day soundtrack along with an overtly militaristic scenario, the love story unfolds. Creator Alan Brown has done quite well here. Clearly the budget was pretty minimal, but he uses light and shadow, pulls focus, includes dance and sport - all to create, effectively enough, a modern-day appreciation of affection, bigotry and intolerance. It's not that it swipes at the US military's approach to being gay, per se, it highlights it - and it also demonstrates that regardless of the overarching \"policy\", it is down to individual people to implement lasting change and improvements. The cast work well together and the film, though it does require concentration, flows along well. Maybe a bit too long, and the sound mix isn't always the best - but it's an interesting watch this."

Peter Weck is the best member of this film, as he brings a charming and kind quality to Max Heller. It's a relatively small cast.\r\n\r\nThe plot isn't perfect, as the film literally starts with one protagonist but ends with another - to the point where it kinda feels like they didn't know which story they wanted to tell most. As alluded to near the top, I would've loved if this was more grittier and harsher - so it would feel like we went on a journey with Tony (Vincent Winter) and Peter (Sean Scully).\r\n\r\nWith that said, this is still a production that leaves positive thoughts."

This drama is beyond that, it tackles our \"first loves\" when we were young, the hopes, the dreams, that feeling of having first fallen in love with someone we totally did not expect but in the end it did not work. Later in life, when we have moved on and our paths crossed again with our first love, it's all about how we handle those feelings and making adult decisions, very hard adult decisions which can make or break relationships and our future.\r\n\r\nArchitecture 101 is for adults who have faced and went through life and the challenges it threw toward us. I do not recommend this to young adults and teenagers as most of them will never appreciate the beauty of the story.

It's basically a good ol' buddy get together as they go back to Seth's house where he has a couple of welcoming gifts awaiting and then they proceed to get high. Seth convinces Jay to go to Franco's party with him so he'll have a chance to get to know everyone better. After being introduced to everyone, they both leave to make a quick stop at a local convenience store when the city starts going abrupt and light beams begin appearing from the sky. From there, both of the actors rejoin the party house in which almost all of the party goers fall into a giant fiery hole that has formed outside of the house. The cast practically spend the rest of the movie wasting time inside the house together, fighting demons, and then trying to get to heaven. It's not the most exciting plot in the world, but it makes for some good comedy. What I found the most interesting was that they never try to fix the problem on Earth. Even towards the end their prime goal is just to get to 'heaven' and escape the apocalypse down below.\r\n\r\n**Rewatchability: 05/15**\r\nAlthough I've actually watched this one twice (once regular and once with commentary), I still give it a 05/15 in this category. The problem is I just don't see myself coming back to this one unless it's playing on the TV and I'm really bored. I do, however, recommend that this movie gets watched at least once. While it's over the top and not meant to be taken seriously in the first place, I guarantee you'll get at least a laugh or two out of it.\r\n\r\n**Acting: 15/20**\r\nSince the actors are actually just portraying magnified versions of themselves it works out really nicely. The scenes with Michael Cera are especially hilarious. At one point in the movie he sneezes out cocaine all over Christopher Mintz (guy who played McLovin in Superbad). Nobody felt out of place and even the add-in actors such as Rihanna and Mindy Kaling did a pretty good job.\r\n\r\n**Audio Production: 10/20**\r\nThe soundtrack comes in heavy with music by the Backstreet Boys, Black Sabbath, Cypress Hill, Def Tones, Psy, and Whitney Houston. This list includes a lot of big names, but it seems like most of the soundtrack was just thrown in. The Backstreet Boys make a cameo at the end of the movie when the cast is in heaven throwing a party. Special effects are done well, but nothing really stands out.\r\n\r\n**Visual Production: 15/20**\r\nThe majority of the film takes place in a ficticious Los Angeles at James Franco's house. All of the visual post process effects and scenes are really well made. Listening to the commentary you can find out that most of the filming actually took place in New Orleans at an old coffee warehouse. Even though most of the film was filmed inside of the same building, it actually works out nicely with the storyline."

All over me.\r\n\r\nAhem. On track.\r\n\r\nI was super-popular and went to see this film by myself. But even so I enjoyed it. I really am not in the least bit fond of American Comedies. There are exceptions to be sure, but overall I feel it's best to just give them a wide berth. I was drawn to this piece though because it was reeled as a \"Horror/Comedy\" (and I mean, what Horrors aren't?) and also because it had James Franco playing James Franco (_Rise of the Planet of the Apes_). And I'm so very glad I let this be one of those exceptions.\r\n\r\nI quite honestly put it up as my top movie of 2013 so far. Which is more surprising to me than anyone else.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, it makes reference to my all time favourite film. Ever. Watch _This is the End_ and if you can pick the moment, I'll give you a prize.\r\n\r\nI did, however (on top of aaallll my other biases) feel as though this film really was targeting hardcore movie-goers/aficionados/critics/filmmakers/writers/etc. and I fit in to... Well at least most of those categories.\r\n\r\nI'm reading over this review and seeing what a bastardised clusterfuck it is. But that's because I just reallyreallyreally want you all to go out and watch it! And I feel anything else I can say would be all spoiler-y. Look, it's the sort of thing I usually would hate, and I am absolutely in love with it. Pleeeaaase go watch this movie with a friend and tell me what you think. I might get back to a more levelheaded review after a DVD release.\r\n\r\n80%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_"

It's hard to be one of those \"few.\"\r\n\r\nLittle Big Horn (AKA: The Fighting Seventh) is directed by Charles Marquis Warren who also adapts the screenplay from a story by Harold Shumate. It stars Lloyd Bridges, John Ireland, Marie Windsor, Reed Hadley and Jim Davis. Music is by Paul Dunlap and cinematography by Ernest Miller.\r\n\r\nA small U.S. Cavalry unit snake their way towards Little Big Horn to warn General Custer of the mortal danger that awaits. But beset with inner conflicts and with the Sioux on their tails, chances of achieving their goal gets slimmer by the hour.\r\n\r\nLow on budget but big on impact, Little Big Horn may just be the finest film to come out of Lippert Productions. With history as it is, the only thing going against Warren's film is that we know this band of men will not achieve their ultimate goal, but that's OK, for this is not about cheap heroics. Film is very grim, both in texture and thematics. With Warren and Miller painting a stark noir look to the visuals, story unfolds with futility the order of the day.\r\n\r\nHeading the group are Capt. Phillip Donlin (Bridges) and Lt. John Haywood (Ireland), who we have witnessed at film's beginning forming a messy love triangle with Celie Donlin (Windsor). Captain Donlin is stickler for the rules, but are his motives clouded now? With the rest of the troop believing Haywood is a wife stealer, friction is palpable, yet Haywood keeps proving himself to be an admirable man, consistently doing things to make the troop reevaluate their feelings towards him. The group dynamic set up by Warren is first class, it crackles with intensity.\r\n\r\nAs the journey proceeds a number of potent scenes and scenarios come into play. A man staked up like a scarecrow as a trap, the drawing of cards to see who rides point - which the men know is almost certainly going to result in death - unmarked graves and wedding rings of the dead, these things really strike grim emotional chords. The Sioux are a constant threat out in the rocks or shadows, this troop, as we soon find out, are at the mercy of their better equipped enemy. There's a resignation residing within the group, yet it is that which binds them together. Arrows thud into bodies and blood pours from mouths, and then the finale comes storming in to close down this quite excellent film noir Western.\r\n\r\nDVD packaged with Rimfire (1949) as a Kit Parker double bill of film noir Westerns, Little Big Horn is very much the better film. Both have the considerable visual skills of Ernest Miller to enjoy, but LBH is the more essential film on account of its across the board excellence. 8/10"

The sharks deserve every meal they can get - but to be fair I'd have fed them those behind the camera before the \"bait\" they are actually presented with. It's typical sci-fi channel fayre. By no means the worst of the genre, but still pretty chewy."

Newman and jointly written by Irwin Allen (who also produces) and Charles Bennett. It stars Victor Mature, Red Buttons, Rhonda Fleming, Kathryn Grant, Vincent Price and Peter Lorre. Plot sees Mature as Hank Whirling, the owner of The Whirling Circus, where, having seen his partner break away to form his own show, he finds he has to beg a loan off the bank to keep the Whirling show going. The bank agree to the loan but on condition that their financial whizz Randolph Sherman (Buttons) travels along with the show to keep an eye on the finances. He in turn hires publicity agent Helen Harrison (Fleming) to professionally sell the product, but both of them are not wanted by Whirling. However, there are more pressing concerns for the show, there is a saboteur at large and it seems whoever it is will stop at nothing to finish off the Circus.\r\n\r\nLooking for a Sunday afternoon time filler full of colour, vibrancy and delightful circus sequences? Then look no further than Irwin Allen's The Big Circus, an entertaining and tidy picture that seems to have been forgotten in the wake (fall out) of The Greatest Show On Earth. Making no bones about it, Allen follows the formula of the Cecil B. DeMille behemoth pretty much all the way, only the budget is considerably smaller so it obviously isn't as gargantuan as the 1952 Best Picture Winner. Fair to say there's some overacting, notably from Mature, but the mystery element is played close to the chest, with pretty much everyone under suspicion, and the high wire/trapeze antics are joyous. Nice cast, nice film and easy to recommend to the undemanding crowd. 6.5/10"

As the circus travels the West into Texas & Eastern states, they enjoy sold out shows, but they’re hindered by a mysterious saboteur and other challenges on the road as they seek to make it to New York City ahead of their rival.\r\n\r\nAn Irwin Allen production, \"The Big Circus\" (1959) is cut from the same cloth as Cecil B. DeMille’s \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (1952), but isn’t as good, although it’s comparable in some ways. For instance, you can’t beat Vincent Price as the ringleader, yet his role is peripheral. Victor Mature is arguably just as formidable as Charlton Heston in the lead role and Gilbert Roland is no slouch as the trapeze leader (compared to Cornel Wilde). However, the female cast isn’t as good nor the female performers, not even close, although Kathryn Grant is winsome enough. \r\n\r\nEven the low-budget \"Circus of Horrors\" (1960) is more all-around entertaining, particularly for adults, but this one is effective enough if you’re in the mood for quaint family fare and appreciate circus/carnival flicks in general. My favorite is probably \"Water for Elephants\" (2011). \"Roustabout\" (1964) and \"Circus of Fear\" (1966), aka \"Psycho-Circus,\" are also worth checking out.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot at MGM Studios in Culver City, SoCal.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

No pithy wit, no innuendo or irony? Well, I take my hat off. It's not a great film, but perhaps that's because it's not actually a great story. \"Lord Darlington\" (Ronald Colman) is keen on \"Lady Windermere\" (May McAvoy) who is contentedly married to \"Lord Windermere\" (Bert Lytell). It is only when the glamorous \"Mrs. Erlynne\" (Irene Rich) gets in touch with Lord \"W\" with some sensitive information that could upset the entire apple cart that the story starts to take shape. Lord \"D\" becomes aware that there is something going on between the pair and, bit of a cad that he is, starts sowing some seeds of uncertainty in their marriage. Neither Lord \"W\" nor \"Mrs. E\" wish to disclose the nature of their new found relationship, and given the courtesan-like reputation of the older lady, naturally Lady \"W\" jumps to a few conclusions of her own... Now the intimate camera work comes into it's own. It can't replace the spoken words, but together with some well considered performances it offers us a truly acceptable alternative - indeed it is almost as much fun to try to lip read or, even better, substitute the words we may have chosen ourselves as the scenario gets more precarious. Rich is exactly that, glamorous and stylish and the settings add texture to this really quite remarkable effort. There's no denying that is misses the author's words - but it's still a good film."

The Billy Connolly character seemed first two-dimensional to me and was barely carried off by the comedian;’s natural charm and winning smile. The Cedrick character felt over the top and didn’t add much to the film despite a strong enough performance by the actor.\r\n\r\nI think the plot and the script let them down, but they soldiered on and made the best of it.  Billy Connolly’s character was ironically at his best when he was serious rather than flirting and pushing peoples’ buttons. Pauline Collins managed to be amusing while suffering from bouts of dementia. There were fine moments throughout the movie and the chemistry between the main characters, but it didn’t quite overcome for me the staleness of the plot and lack of depth in a few of the characters.\r\n\r\nAsa side note, there is a nice gesture during the credits as they reveal that many of the supporting cast have had music careers of their own with a quick display of their then and now pictures and a brief description of their claim to fame."

However, I also felt a bit underwhelmed.\r\n\r\nA less than sympathetic bum happens to be some direct ancestor to an ancient warrior belonging to a ancient secret assassins society protecting the apple of Eden. Since he is a near identical match to his ancestor he is, apparently, an ideal candidate for the evil Knights Templars to unlock ancient “genetic” memories that will help them find the apple. Yes I know, it is a bit of a scientific stretch but hey, it is a fantasy/sci-fi movie and it originates from a video game story so give it some slack.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the video game. I have not played the game and I have no idea if the movie follows the story of the game or not which probably is a good think for this movie. What I did have a hard time with though is this nonsensical notion of the apple containing the genetic code for “free will”. What a load of bullshit in so many ways!\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of quite good action and fight scenes in the movie. However most of them are flashbacks to the time of Callum’s ancestor and it is not really Callum himself. It is not until the very end of the movie that Callum finally realizes his potential and gets to do some fighting in his own time. This disappointed me a bit.\r\n\r\nOverall I felt a bit underwhelmed. The movie plodded along at an almost leisurely pace except for the outbursts of action in the flashbacks. There was not really much happening that made me interested except for the action sequences. The acting is also adequate but not more.\r\n\r\nWhen Callum finally gets around to do some assassin stuff in our time it is too little too late. There is a nice fight when he and his assassin colleagues break out of the Knights Templar’s facility but the final show down between the two parties is, well, bland."

I mean ever since the trend had started from the video games to the big screen, this one was a bit late to come into the party. My guess was, that's the disadvantage. The film fanatics thinks, there are too many graphics films. Besides, they did not pick the right screenplay for it like EA did for 'Need for Speed'.\r\n\r\nI have never played this game, so I was not expecting it like the others, but I'm surely disappointed with the film. I had no idea about the characters or the universe, it sets in. After watching the film I thought why this game is so famous where I did not find this film any good. Yep, it's not fair to compare two different formats. But the fact will remain that the film was one of the worst among big titles releasing on this year.\r\n\r\nI thought it was like 'Matrix', but more a periodic style action- adventure. I think the cast was good and the rest of the film was not. What I disliked the most was the smoky visuals. Yes, all the scenes with the ancient Spain was very smoky atmosphere that I had hard time to have a clear picture of what's going on. I hope there won't be any sequel to it, but if they do plan, I expect a miracle that erases all the bad image created by this part. The film is watchable, but not likable or enjoyable.

Rather than being a hindrance to the overall product, I believe this \"flaw\" serves the style of this movie wonderfully, and honors to source material to create an interesting and engaging fictional world.\r\n\r\nThe discerning eye of a devoted film-goer may think this movie is quite beautiful and would find very little argument from me. Certain shots and choices in lighting are remarkable, and the filmmakers emphasis on practicality over computer renderings translates very well during the action sequences. \r\n\r\nI would recommend this film - you may not love it, and you don't have to - but it is certainly worth watching."

And it doesn't take much digging to find some that are really despicable, unworthy of being seen in a big screen. I had some hope that this movie wasn't that bad, knowing minimally the game (I never had the time or patience to play it, but I read about it and saw some graphics). And really, it's a film that, in the wide spectrum of its genre, has some qualities. However, it is far from being a full plate for lovers of good movies.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film are the technical and visual aspects and also the action scenes, with highly stylized choreography and fight routines, unrealistic to the point of sounding very absurd, but incredible. The cinematography is very good, and the film makes incredible use of CGI and digital resources. It seems to me that the director, Justin Kurzel, preferred to turn the film into an orgy of visual graphics than to do a solid job. Excessive attention to visuals has everything from stunning aerial perspective footage to the elaborate sets and environments of the Spain of the Catholic Kings, creatively blended with footage in real settings such as the Alhambra.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the film's first problem, which is the absurd lack of historical accuracy. Considering it's a movie based on a video game, it's less of an issue, but it's an issue, particularly when taking advantage of the popularity of the Templar Order, which was defunct and outlawed by the Catholic Church in 1312, nearly 250 years before the time of the Catholic Kings. Whoever wrote the script and included this premise probably barbecued their own history school textbooks.\r\n\r\nThe cast is made up of renowned and talented actors, but who have not been given anything substantial. There are no characters, there are names, and the actors seem to be improvising or being themselves in some way. Michael Fassbender plays himself with a hood, since the character is nothing more than a walking cliché with no personality. Marion Cotillard, a great actress, must have been royally paid to accept such rubbish in her curriculum and Jeremy Irons proves to be very capable of making an omelette without eggs, going to resurrect what he has done previously in several villains of his career and mixing everything.\r\n\r\nWhat really lets this movie down is the miserable script and poor direction. If we've already talked a little about director Kurzel's apparent fetish for visual effects, we should also talk about the incompetence of the screenwriting team. It would have been better if they had been prevented from writing screenplays. This one is just a giant jumble of confusing ideas involving time travel, genetic memory, futuristic machines, the Inquisition, the Templar's, Columbus, the Catholic Kings of Spain, an Islamic religious sect from Persia and other oddities. The film takes itself too seriously, it is presumptuous and exhausting, and the feeling that hovers over it is existential emptiness, as if there was no reason for any of this."

Clothier.\r\n\r\nAfter his appealing run in the TV series Cheyenne, it was inevitable that Clint Walker would make the transition to big screen fare.

Never blessed with great acting talent, Walker was however a mighty presence, and handsome to boot, and he is the prime reason why Fort Dobbs is a better than average experience.\r\n\r\nPlot basically has Walker as Gar Davis, a fugitive of justice who hooks up for a travelogue with Celia Grey (Mayo) and her son Chad (Eyer). Along the way there is Comanche peril, shifty companionship in the form of Clett (Keith) and a cunning twist that strains the relationship between Gar and the Greys. The wonderful Henry Repeater Rifle comes into play, very much so, and it provides some kinetic excitement, and it all builds to a rousing finale of explosions and stunts, while of course redemption and the truths will out. Clothier and Steiner further cement their reputations as skilled craftsmen, with the former beautifully realising the Kanab locations in black and white, and Douglas knows his way around a good honest Oater. 7/10"

Coleman reminded me of Errol Flynn here; he displays a charming intimacy with both his colleagues and the audience that is engaging. Rathbone - who lost out on the Oscar to Walter Brennan for \"Kentucky\" (1938) - is also excellent as the shrewd monarch who must hold his kingdom together, despite some pretty obvious character flaws!

Only once he has left the safety of his parochial responsibilities, does he discover a fondness for his landlady (Kathleen Harrison) and a flair for business and is soon proving that his inability was little impediment to his happiness and success. The second features an on-form Nigel Patrick as a show-off who manages to alienate just about everyone on an ocean cruise with his rather vulgar, ostentatious manner but yet is not quite as odious an individual as his image presents. Finally, we head to a baronial style castle in the north of Scotland where people are sent to convalesce and recover from tuberculosis. The latter story has the better cast, and a decently interwoven series of stories as the patients try to deal with their illness, and their demons - with mixed results - but even with Michael Rennie, Jean Simmons, André Morrell and a rather enjoyable pairing of John Laurie and Finlay Currie drags on just a bit too long. It's all interestingly linked together by the author, and takes a series of swipes at the British and their attitudes and prejudices in a clever, at times quite witty way."

All the faces were fresh, I liked them, but should have been a little better. I won't deny that I enjoyed watching it, but I can't say it is a very clever screenplay. Because it was slightly comparable to 'Ex Machina', though the story derives when we had a conception like 'what if'. Just like 'Big Stan' and 'Get Hard', though this film was planned before 'Ex Machina' and sadly released after it.\r\n\r\nThe story of a journalist who interviews a scientist who developed an advanced AI. A week long interaction and when the final day arrives something terrible happens, that's going to flip the story you had seen so far. The whole film was shot inside a large house, there is no outside world, except in one scene which takes us to the terrace. I did not figure it out the secret, but I kind thought of it, so when it happened at the end I was not surprised.\r\n\r\nFor a B movie, it is a great quality. If you want to check it out a second string films, this is not a bad one to consider. There is no major, any impactable graphics to the narration, but in most of the crucial section was managed well. So the production quality is much better than I expected and so the overall film. Nowadays it is a very common for filmmakers to choose the robot theme in drama, but how good their film would be is our question and this one passed the test.\r\n\r\n6/10"

They serve as constant reminders that no matter the seriousness, toil and drama poured into cinema, there’s always room for levity.\r\n\r\nThat said, Argentinian writer-director Diego Rougier’s “Sal” hit me just the right way with its mix of Western iconography, gorgeous photography and limitless sardonicism.\r\n\r\nTo simply make the comparison between this darkly comic Western thriller and “No Country for Old Men” seems insufficient, even though the Best Picture winner immediately springs to mind while watching “Sal.” The influence of the Coen Bros. is steeped throughout this film, right from the opening caveat (a la “Fargo”) that the story is based on true events — a claim that seems dubious but in good fun.\r\n\r\nFele Martínez (best known from Alejandro Amenábar’s “Abre Los Ojos” and Pedro Almodóvar’s “Bad Education”) leads viewers between the world of aspiring screenwriter Sergio and the rough-and-tumble arena of revenge faced by Diego, a man for whom Sergio is mistaken after traveling to northern Chile to research his troubled script, a Western titled “Sal.”\r\n\r\nThe fabled Diego left some scores unsettled with the local jefe, Victor (Patricio Contreras), and his wife, Maria (Javiera Contadar, who also serves as producer), all of them Sergio must answer for, a mistaken identity case that reminds me of the fun and twisted “The Big Lebowski” at times.\r\n\r\nAiding Sergio in his quest to find a tantilizing story for his script (not to mention survive the torment of Victor and his gang) is the old man Vizcacha (Sergio Hernández), who himself has revenge on his mind vis a vis Victor.\r\nWhile somewhat heavy-handed in its transitions between the supposed reality of Sergio’s script trip and the boots-and-belts drama of Diego, “Sal” never suffers for lack of humor, especially from Hernández’s mentor-hermit character and the comically irascible henchman Pascual (Luis Dubbo).\r\n\r\nEqually compelling is the rich cinematography of David Bravo, whose camera movements and respect for natural light across scorched desert days and fire-lit nights help ground the main narrative while indulging in color and saturation tricks for dream sequences and cutaways to the plot of Sergio’s film-within-a-film.\r\n\r\nWhile some viewers may find the transitions grating and tiresome, the humor, performances and overall production quality in “Sal” keep you invested and entertained."

What now ensues is a battle of wills that increasingly polarises both men of principle with an underwhelming Holden treading the middle ground. The frequently quite appalling subject matter is pretty clunkily handled; the plot oversimplifies just about everything it touches and ultimately we are left with characterisations that offer the audience little to like or to, until right at the very end, sympathise with. This last film from the usually engaging Webb is hardly a fitting cinematic epitaph, but at least he does do his job - something no-one else on either side of the camera can reasonably claim to do well here."

        "content": "**Angel Games in a Machine World**—Walerian Borowczyk’s Les jeux des anges (1964)\r\n\r\nEarlier this month at the Goethe Institut of Paris, a gem of 1960s surrealist animation was projected : Les jeux des anges (1964), a 13-minute short made by Polish director Walerian Borowczyk (1923 – 2006). François Bonenfant, coordinateur pédagogique cinema et arts visuels at Fresnoy (Tourcoing, France), gave a brief introduction to the film, remarking that the short was “pictoral”, resembling a love-child of “Guernica and Francis Bacon”. Ambitious as it is to say, the film offers exactly that.\r\n\r\nThe film starts with a low rumble, the industrial sound of being within the bowels of a train, and almost-entirely black screen with a pan of grey that chugs along the bottom. This image stops, leading to the début of the film, without the spectator ever knowing what it was – a sign to come of the abstract surrealist imagery to come.\r\n\r\nThe scene is set when the camera focuses upon an empty grey cell – a prison? the inside of a machine? – garnished only with several open pipes and a few geometric openings in the walls. Although very much an animation, the camera movements imply that the scene is a painting: the camera slides from room to room methodically, showing the intricate inner workings of a non-peopled world, what could easily be interpreted as the inside of an empty vending machine, or a factory with no product or materials.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the somber grey and black colors brighten, classical organ music simultaneously enlivens the tone, and three red objects are quickly covered by a grill, and the first figurative images are shown: headless, winged beings, the head of a 19th century lady. The rest of the film shows primarily objects within this gloomy machine-world : with sounds like ice or breaking glass, objects seem to be violently beheaded, head-objects roll like in a child’s marble games, and shape-shifting organic (and alternately non-organic) matter scuffle like small fighting bodies highly reminiscent of Bacon’s abstract carnal forms. All the while, the organ music, at the same time beautiful, powerful, frightening and cacophonic, implies a dark powerful morbidity and lack of control.\r\n\r\nThe film was made in France, six years after Borowczyk moved from Poland to collaborate with such French cinematographic stars as Chris Marker, whose influence upon the film is clear. Marker’s unique photographic style (see: La Jetée, 1962, the “roman-photo” constructed from rapidly montaged still images) is evident in the speed of the moving “beings” of Borowczyk’s film, as well as in his still shots, mechanical camera movements, and rapid scene changes.\r\n\r\nMore recently, the same style can be seen in the work of Jan Svankmeyer, creator of the 2005 film Lunacy in which stop-motion animation permits pieces of meat (butcher cuts that range from steaks, to eyeballs, to entrails) to escape their packaging, slither, and dance their way around a film set in a 19th century French insane asylum.\r\n\r\nThe darkness, however, and the very mechanical figures and environments, seem a unique product of Borowczyk’s personal life alone. The destruction, the violence, the cacophony, can be seen as a critique of the various forms of outside control of Poland, which during Borowcyzk’s life suffered not only a Nazi occupation, but a Soviet occupation, before finally, a short time before the director’s move to France, the People’s Republic of Poland was declared. All three highly repressive regimes in terms of freedom of speech, Borozcyk struggled with his cinematographic expression both in and outside of Poland.\r\n\r\nMost recently, his films have pushed the envelope on the filming of desire, notably in his live-action films La Bête, which includes a highly-graphic scene of a “beast” resembling a bear copulating with a (human) woman, and Contes Immoraux (1974) which includes three chapters, each on a different sexual taboo. Due to the explicit nature of these films, his work has recently been derided as pornography, and the launch of his actual soft-core pornography career in 1987 did little to dissuade public opinion on the art-house value of his live-action films.\r\n\r\nLes jeux des anges, however, shows nothing that is sexually explicit, although the darkness of the music, colors, actions, and figures foresees a violence to come. Despite lack of linearity and the abstraction of the images, a dark philosophical message is evident symbolically identical to his (more linear) animation of the same period, Renaissance (1963) : destroyed objects reconstitute themselves until the final item, a bomb, reconstitutes itself, detonates itself, and renders all, once more, a ruin. In such a way, the morbid world of flesh and mechanics that Borowczyk describes in Jeux des anges is one that reminds us all of the violence and futility of society and life itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatricia Bass"

Can they solve this before the police apprehend them again, and again - or, ideally, before anyone else gets bumped off? Nope, there's not the slightest hint of jeopardy here and the production is really very basic. That said, there's a bit of an entertaining dynamic between Warren and Blore and the whole thing has enough of it's tongue in it's cheek to keep it entertaining if not exactly taxing on the little grey cells. It's twenty minutes too long, and at times it regurgitates itself a bit much - but as wartime whodunits go, it's by no means the worst."

The other thread involves spies, fronted by a straight backed Rennie, and the search by the Germans to locate something important in his grasp. Naturally the play unfolds at the titular lighthouse of the title.\r\n\r\nAnd so we have shoot-outs, awesome mano-mano fight (Kristan has a hook for his right hand), some nifty model work destruction, period flavours (large square kettle - hooray) and lots of shadowy photography. There's even an absolute peach of a left hook thrown that looks real! While the finale excites and has a touch of horror about it.

But earlier, I thought it would be like the movie 'Tusk' which made me a little uncomfortable to watch. So in the end, what's the difference between the tusk and/or the horn. Both come in a pair and animals have it to defend themselves from the threat. When I watched that movie, I lost interest in this.

It was a Canadian-US jointly produced, adapted from a book of the same name and directed by 'Mirror' director. The story was so good, not genuine, though explored the theme very well. For every few minutes later, the narration was taking a turn and that made the plot to get lot tighter before heading for the concluding part.\r\n\r\nMaybe this the best movie of Radcliffe that I've seen after his goodbye to 'Harry Potter' movie series.

Music is by Francesco De Masi and cinematography by Julio Ortas.\r\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things as regards Pasta Westerns, Mario Caiano's Oater is strictly routine. The plot is the basic lone gunman out for revenge theme, where in the weathered scuzzy frontage of Anthony Steffen, it involves the infiltration into a gang of scum-bags to get said revenge. \r\n\r\nIt's atypical of the genre around this time, it's a picture more concerned with raising the pulse rather than making any sort of thematic statements. There's no great style to praise, the dubbing is poor, the fight choreography weak, while all the foxy women on show are given short shrift big time. However, the action is never far away, thus ensuring the pic is never ever dull. \r\n\r\nSteffen makes for a cool dude under pressure, the actor would make a telling contribution to the genre with director Caiano, and he's given a number of scenes to hone his gruff rough and tough persona. The villains, fronted by an excitable Lupe Rojo (Calvo) and a maniacal Murdoch (Fajardo) are great fun. There's a great score from De Masi to help things along, and a super title song warbled by Peter Tevis lands in the ears and stays there. Hell! There's even a comedy old geezer doing his best Moore Marriott impression to keep us perky.\r\n\r\nIt's clichéd, it doesn't utilise the locales or the Widescreen format and it is scared to deviate away from the Spag Western film making 101 play book. Yet sometimes for genre fans this sort of fare is enough for a good time to be had, and so it proves. 6.5/10"

        "content": "It's completely silly, and very \"British\", but I rather enjoyed this daft caper about the inhabitants of the tiny island of \"Todday\" who resist Government plans to militarise their homeland. It is clearly intended as a sequel to \"Whisky Galore\" with a few of the same characters rallying to the cause. Like many of Compton Mackenzie's stories, it is quirkily put together offering us loads of characters with idio(t)synchracies that raise a smile rather than a guffaw. Donald Sinden is completely lost here, though. His typically theatrical style of acting drags this down from an otherwise, gently entertaining base. The rest of the cast - Gordon Jackson, Noel Purcell and Duncan Macrae help to pepper the slightly dull script with some charismatic nostalgia for the first film, and demonstrate the feistiness and independence of these Scottish islanders who want no law but their own... It is fun, maybe not great, but still enjoyable."

It stars Randolph Scott, Wayne Morris, Joan Weldon, Joe Sawyer, James Millican, Charles Bronson and James Bell. Music is by David Buttolph and Warnercolor cinematography is by Bert Glennon.\r\n\r\nBefore he would make the Western movies with Budd Boetticher that would define him as a Western movie legend, Randolph Scott worked tirelessly in the genre. He would make 6 films with Ray Enright and 6 with Andre De Toth, all of these are good value for the Western fan. They vary in thematic quality, but production value was always decent and there was always Randy at war with some gruff or poncey bloke, nice location photography and of course some gorgeous ladies as well. That’s enough for genre fans who happily take these movies on their required terms.\r\n\r\nAnyone else got anything to say?\r\n\r\nRiding Shotgun has Scott as Larry Delong, a man who spends his time “riding shotgun” as a stagecoach guard. He has an ulterior motive, though, he’s constantly on the look out for a known outlaw, Dan Marady (Millican), and he wants him dead. Sure enough Malady is about the place and Larry falls into a trap and finds things spiralling so out of control, that by the time he manages to get back into town, practically everyone hates him and thinks he’s part of Marady’s murderous gang.\r\n\r\nHate makes a man careless.\r\n\r\nCue a scenario where Delong, who has been wonderfully providing us with a film noir like narration throughout (love the wry David and Goliath observation), literally has to make a one man stand against the dimwit townsfolk and also Marady and his henchmen who are fronted by twitchy gun Pinto! (Bronson). It clocks in at under 75 minutes, it’s brisk, it has Scott kicking ass big time and it looks lovely (unsurprising with Glennon photographing). \r\n\r\nIs it flawless? God no! There’s some distinctly below average acting around Scott (Morris/Millican), while Fritz Feld as the Cantina owner (erm, called Fritz) where Delong holes up, is annoying in the extreme. While as radiant and perky as Joan Weldon is, she’s no actress capable of grabbing a scene and shooting electricity through it. But this type of Scott Oater is comfort food to genre fans who once in a while like to down pistols and relax away from the more serious genre fare. 7/10"

We just gotta have faith in humanity, otherwise the insanity that resides within all of us will prevail & that will be the end of 'US'.\r\n\r\nI just wish everyone in the world can have the sensitivity towards others faith as Pooja Bhatt's character had in every religion.\r\n\r\nExcellent movie, can be watched by anyone anywhere in the world & be felt moved emotionally!"

It's only 80 minutes and George Marshall sees that the romance is kept to a minimum and that there are plenty of horse chases, shoot 'em ups and even some humour as the gang try to stay one step ahead. It's always nice to see Mary Gordon (\"Ma Dalton\" here, but always \"Mrs. Hudson\" in the Rathbone/Bruce \"Sherlock Holmes\" mysteries) and I quite enjoyed this."

Focused on a small family with two little kids having a nice time in the theme park.

I don't think in any way the film offends the Disney park and Disney fans. Though the Disney did a fine job ignoring it rather than creating more publicity for the film by suing. It was just a possibility of life event which can take place anywhere, anytime. So, that's how it came into the life with this children's favourite theme park.

It was much better than what I have heard about it. At least it did not sound like a loud and lousy like any modern sci-fi flicks, chasing bad guys, bombing cities and downing buildings. But as a superhero and sci-fi film, it had its moment, only at the end.\r\n\r\nObviously the film was too slow and dramatisation was a backslash keeping the youngsters (audience) in mind. I actually expected hefty stunt sequences. Without actions, a superhero movie is like a limbless spider and toothless shark. If the web and tooth are the superpowers, then they must handle it quite smartly. So that is where this film failed to be a clever. This film had 4 superheroes and until the climax they were impotent. Which means the only superhero movie in the recent time that meant for older people. Precisely to say, if you are a 30+, you might enjoy it as I did. I know I can't talk for you and what kind of movies you like, but I know todays youngsters who refuse dramas and accept action-adventures.\r\n\r\nI agree it did not deliver as it should have been as a theatrical feature where surround speakers are ready to give us a breathtaking sound mix. I felt it some kind of a television episode. Because that is how the modern television series are presented. Personally, I would like to say that don't mind my words and the review, because I usually enjoy all the films I watch. So this one was average to me, but definitely not a bad and I won't slam it.

Having said that maybe there was still a glimmer of hope given that some of their latest Marvel work have been rather okay. Unfortunately this is not the reboot of the Fantastic Four that I, and a dare say the fans, hoped for.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I do not understand is why the dumbass script writers that Hollywood employs always have to change the basic story of a set of characters that have a solid fan base? There was nothing wrong with the original story, and thus origin, of the Fantastic Four and the source of their powers. Maybe I am just old-fashioned but still.\r\n\r\nThe second gripe I have with this movie is the nonsensical stuff with members of the Fantastic Four, especially Ben, being deployed by the US military. It is just so cliché. Lazy script writing plain and simple. Unfortunately this also causes the movie to not really feel like it is a Fantastic Four movie. The team is split up and it is not until the very end that they actually become a team, gets a headquarter and so on. Big fail as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, I do not think it is as bad as some people claim. There are some good stuff in there. The story is not all bad after all even though it is not exactly to my liking and the special effects are quite okay. One thing that annoys me with the story is that the role of Reed is really diminished and he is never really allowed to show of his powers. Yes, I know, there are some “stretching” moments but, well, meh! To add to the pain the actor cast as Reed is, in my mind, totally unconvincing.\r\n\r\nThe bad guy is also somewhat underwhelming and thoroughly predictable. As I said a classical Hollywood concoction aimed towards the less intelligent viewers. I do not understand why Hollywood seems to be so bent on repeating the same mistakes over and over again?\r\n\r\nWell, as I wrote, the movie is not as bad as some people claim but it is far from great. Given the abysmal reviews I am afraid that we will not be getting a sequel which is a shame. This is one of the (few) Marvel comics that I read as a kid (in Sweden we did not get treated to that many of these kind of comics) so it is indeed a bit of a disappointment that they managed to screw this movie up…again."

Once again, we find \"Jack Sparrow\" (Johnny Depp) in a bit of bother from someone from his past. This time it is Javier Bardem (\"Salazar\") who has escaped from his purgatory in the \"Devil's Triangle\" to avenge himself on his arch-enemy. Meantime, the young \"Henry Turner\" (Brenton Thwaites) seeks help to track down Poseidon's Trident which will empower him to take control of the seas, and to reunite with his father - the original \"Bootstrap\" (Orlando Bloom). There's no doubt that this is a great looking film, the effects are spectacular but the story is little better than a regurgitation of voyages gone by. The cuties that were Bloom and Kiera Knightley have been succeeded by the handsome, boyish Thwaites and his feisty astronomer pal \"Carina\" (Kaya Scodelario) but otherwise, it is another pretty formulaic prolongation of this colourful adventure franchise. It has some humour, there's a tiny cameo from Sir Paul McCartney that raises a smile (if only because you are never entirely sure if it is actually him); Geoffrey Rush still manages to inject oodles of charisma as \"Barbossa\", and Bardem offers a bit of menace - but Depp can only get away with that hail-fellow-well-met meets a drunk persona so often before he becomes a parody of his own characterisation. It's fun to watch, for a time, but after a while I was just bored. The format offers unlimited opportunity for fantasy and adventure, but maybe it is time for the \"Black Pearl\" to join the \"Queen Mary\" and HMY \"Britannia\" and just settle down as a respectable old lady of the sea - and a tourist attraction!"

        "content": "Like I said in 'Song of the Sea' review, its a 3D animation dominated world. That's mainly in Hollywood, but trend spreading so fast everywhere. Even the Japan shifting gear from anime to 3D anime, I saw it in 'Space Pirate: Captain Harlock'. From a comic book to 2D animation is easy because they are much alike, but it's different when it comes to the 3D. I have seen Micky Mouse and Co transformed into 3D characters that I did not like, because some characters do not suit for that kind of leap. In Micky Mouse, the ears were the biggest drawback. But 'Tintin' was a success and so expecting 'Popeye' would do the same magic which is due next year (2016).\r\n\r\nI have seen all the 'Asterix & Obelix' movies so far from both the format, live-shot and animation, but this is the first 3D animation. I'm so happy that it came overall very well, every detail was retained. Even those mud-smoke/dirt-smoke (whatever it's called) shown exactly as it to be which forms during their fight after the consumption of magic potion. That concept is for comic book, to make understand the readers the situation because the picture is still. But in a motion picture you can show the whole action, if they make that change the trademark will lose. So I must praise the technical side of the movie for the lossless transformation.\r\n\r\nIt's like a new beginning in the series in the 'Asterix & Obelix' franchise. Especially this story was not freshly written for the screen, but taken straight from one of the comic books in the series called 'The Mansions of the Gods'. In 3D animation, emotions, violence, comedies would be a little realistic. That's why the movie like 'Brave', 'Frozen', 'Up' appealed strongly on the sentimental side. Gaul's favourite food, the wild boar hunting was compromised, because children would be watching the movie and it might disturb on the softer side of them. Just like the filmmakers avoided the Giant's children and women in 'Jack the Giant Slayer'.\r\n\r\nOne of the best things in 'Asterix & Obelix' movies is that the movie might not be awesome, but still it entertains and keeps you engaged. You can't spot the flaws, in animation all are relevant. A man can jump 1000 feet high and leap a mile away. So if there should be something, that must come from the technical side. Since it (Gauls in 3D) is new and so much fun, you can't concentrate finding those faults or you will miss the actual enjoyment.\r\n\r\n> ‘‘It's weird that the house looks like a box.’’\r\n\r\nAs usual the story set in the first BC. The Gaul's enemy the Romans comes with a new strategy to defeat them. They begin to build the large mansions near to their village and later to invade by seducing the community by the Roman culture. So the fight begins between them where the innocent civilians and black slaves get affect more. But Gaul's main intention is to keep the ecosystem unaffected, especially they're against the Romans modern fancy civilization. What happens to the Julius Caeser's 'Veni, Vidi, Vici' is the movie's final battle to disclose.\r\n\r\nProbably a best 'Asterix & Obelix' movie compared to the previous couple of movies. Good to see a non-Hollywood 3D animated movie with a great quality and doing well commercially as well. A whole family together watchable movie, not only for the children. Hoping for the a sequel, I mean very soon. All the above it was short and sweet which runs about 80 minutes. If you are a fan of this comic, you will love it, because lots of the frames look alike. Must be dedicated  to the fans.\r\n\r\n7/10"

The biggest problem I have with many Jimmy Wang Yu is how obvious it is that he is in fact not a good martial artist, he can sell it reasonably well most of the time but the filming and editing style really differs on his movies versus single wide shot that were popular at the time. Jimmy's acting here is pretty good as was most of the cast. The story was quite a bit better than most of the \"police goes undercover\" films. The fighting is pretty clumsy and slow at times but the length and brutality shown more than make up for any short comings. The end fight is the biggest highlight of the film and it's what really raised the rating for me, it showed me somethings I've never really seen in this type of film, this is the first time I'm seen a sword fight in the mud and I really enjoyed it. Also both fighters became exhausted which as most fan would know doesn't happen in most martial arts movie as fighter will fight hundreds of opponents for an hours without even breathing hard, so to me at least this was refreshing. Overall this movie really entertained me with it's complex but easy to follow story, decent acting and great finale."

Its his back to back after 'Vehicle 19' which also had a limited cast. At least he and his directors with writers proved these kind of small movies has an equal level of interesting materials to the grand ones. So it's about how you make one with all the finite resources and the rest is left to the people who decides its fate.\r\n\r\nA trans-apocalyptic movie.

Obviously leaves some doubts concerning the main plot, but what the story tells is the basic instinct of survival of any species of our world. So in this film all about stay alive and protect your loved ones or die trying.\r\n\r\nWhat a father's, at a time a husband's role should be when his family completely depends him. That's what the story where a man stands between his family and the hurdles that coming his way.

He seems content enough with the arrangement, has a mistress and they agree that after a suitable period, they will divorce. Of course, it doesn't quite turn out that way and John Cromwell manages to take an ordinary melodrama and inject some panache into it. Both stars are on good form, the writing is subtle, humorous and does much to keep the characterisations engaging (if not especially likeable). Henry Stephenson puts in a good turn as her father, as does her almost as venal sister \"Val\" (Lucille Browne). It's a variation of an oft told story, nothing greatly new - but it has a charm about it that I found just a bit better than I was initially expecting."

        "content": "*SPOILERS* \r\n\r\nI bought this film from Amazon and I really liked it! I've read some really positive reviews and some negative ones as well, but being an indie film fan and a fan of previous John Orrichio films - I bought Abduction. The camera-work is his best yet with beautiful outdoor shots and disturbing lighting and effects that show how the town is twisted behind closed doors, but picturesque and normal to the outside world.\r\n\r\nIt's the story of a remote New Jersey small town that is not on any map. Basically the townsfolk kidnap unsuspecting tourists and sell them into slavery, they harvest their organs for sale on the black market or make leather goods out of them! Everything starts to unravel when an up & coming pop star from South America is kidnapped and her bodyguards come to town to find her. The whole town is in on the secret. The story is original and plays out well. The first 10 minutes are a little slow, but it picks up nicely from there.\r\n\r\nAs for the acting, Tony Rugnetta (Jacob) is excellent. His best role to date. Roberto Lombardi (Johnny) is perfect, convincingly evil & sexy at the same time! Christy Callas (Lilly) who is vulnerable & sinister at the same time and Gerry Kirschbaum (Doc) who has the cool demeanor of a Doctor with a hidden mania. Other notable performances are Deana Demko (Rosie) and Christina Sampson (Myrtle). There is rarely a stumble by any of the actors.\r\n\r\nI also think that to truly enjoy this film you have to take it for what it is. A low budget, well made drama / thriller that is a little creepy, a little campy/funny and a little bloody. It's not a horror film per se and it's not for everyone. If you want the thrills of a Saw movie, pass on this. If you like Rosemary's Baby, this is right up your alley. The film has gotten bashed, but I believe that is coming from former colleagues of the film maker who are bitter. Judge for yourself!!"

        "content": "Aside from Felix Aylmer's appearance as the President of his South American country, I hadn't really heard of many of the cast of jobbing British actors drafted in for this amiable crime caper. High-roller \"Mortimer\" (Donald Stewart) is determined to close a big deal but is neglecting his increasingly bored wife \"Teri\" (Anne Crawford). Intent on getting his attention, she goes to an high-end jewellers where she has discovered the eponymous diamond is being sold. Now one of her husband's underlings has alerted his boss to her visit and once they are both there, things start to hot up! A robbery is afoot, and with the help of some rather potent perfume she is relieved of her new jewel and the police are soon on the case. Later that evening they attend a state dinner with the aforementioned president and it's there that they realise that their charming and debonaire robber is also in attendance - in the guise of an influential businessman. Can they retrieve the stone - and the state jewels that have also been pilfered - before this character makes good their escape? At times this borders on the farce, but it is pretty well executed with good timing and just a little more sophistication to keep the pot boiling. Certainly, it's twenty minutes too long and the ending stretches out the theme a bit too far, but for the most part it's an enjoyable outing for Crawford and for Charles Helsop as long-suffering aide \"Dilfallow\" that moves along with a bit of style and a decent pace."

I had feared a rather dull expedition into romance and associated plot mechanics - but this exceeded the usual tropes by portraying a series of damaged but not irredeemable people all looking for some kind of salvation in part of what is now Myanmar.\r\n\r\nKay Francis plays a character whose journey runs from refugee of the Russian Revolution to mistress of a dubious arms dealer, to high class prostitute, partner to an alcoholic and then to a potential redemption (all within 65 minutes).  \r\n\r\nHer performance covers off the emotions of all of these roles well, through her expressive eyes conveying hope, despair, confidence and murderous intent as needed.  It is a superb jewel of acting on display and the centrepiece of the film.\r\n\r\nGood support is provided by Lyle Talbot as an alcoholic doctor, the Swedish Warner Oland as a kind of Chinese gangster / classless brothel manager and Ricardo Cortez as a resourceful but uncaring man.\r\n\r\nMichael Curtiz, of Casablanca fame and innumerable other great films, is perhaps slumming a little here, but the camera work is very confident.  An early shot follows a motor boat from the port across the bay then sweeps away from the boat to glide smoothly towards a moored yacht and eventually to introduce a character on the railing.  It is really superbly done and adds class to the story.  \r\n\r\nThe settings are all convincing and the crew somehow manage to convey a feeling of a south-east Asian port, paddle steamers on jungle infested rivers and a diverse populous without presumably ever having left Los Angeles.  \r\n\r\nThis is a small triumph of 1930s filmmaking."

        "content": "In an off-camera field somewhere in England, a battle is raging. A small, vicious part of the English Civil Wars of the mid-17th century. Stumbling out of the hedgerow into the empty neighbouring field is Whitehead (Reece Shearsmith, The League of Gentlemen). He's clearly no soldier and he's no heart for the horrors of war. He's joined on this quieter side of the hedges by Jacob, Cutler and - when he awakes from his death-like concussion - Friend. It transpires at least one side in this skirmish was on a specific mission: to hunt down the villainous O'Neill (Michael Smiley, Kill List), an alchemist's servant who has stolen his master's valuable documents and writings so's he can practice the dark arts for himself. Whitehead is another servant to the alchemist, sent to sniff out O'Neill. Still, sod that. It's all gotten a bit, well, bloody for these fellows, and besides, Cutler knows of a lovely alehouse, just yonder past this field. So they're not deserting you understand, they're just... well, going for a quick beer. No harm done, eh? Anyway, they haven't eaten in awhile, so Cutler's just going to make them a stew from the mushrooms that grow in a huge circle in this field. And what's that in the middle of the field, tied to a huge length of rope? They pull on the rope; it takes all four of them to pull the object over to them, and as it transpires, it's a man. It's O'Neill, the man Whitehead was charged with finding. Why was he so heavy? There have been tales of course that time moves differently for people inside the mushroom circles that grow in fields in England, thus altering their density. In fact, a lot of weird sh*t happens around these mushroom fields. And that mushroom stew Cutler made is making our guys feel really, um, strange. And they haven't caught O'Neill, he seems to have caught them. And Cutler seems to know O'Neill. And who's idea was it to go look for a pub? How much further IS this pub, anyway? It's almost as though they've been set up... oh...\r\n\r\nA lot of what may or may not be happening in A Field in England - the latest from Ben Wheatley (Kill List, Sightseers), working from a script by his partner Amy Jump (who also co-wrote Kill List with Wheatley) - past the half-hour mark is depicted in strange ways indeed, that we may share in our compadres' hallucinogenic nightmare. Slow-mo? Check. Terrifying Aphex Twin-style rictus grins? Check. Renaissance penis diseases? Check. Everybody periodically freezing for a wood carving tableau? Check. Ten minutes of fit-inducing stroboscopic imaging, set to droning Lynchian industrial soundscapes? Oh, you better BELIEVE there's a check right there.\r\n\r\nProblems? A few, IMO. The off-kilter sojourns into psychedelia will polarize the viewers of A Field in England. We get it, it's the mushies. So when these episodes seem to go on and on (and ON), it begins to feel self-indulgent. As though somehow, weird for weird's sake equals high art, or something. It can become a litttle arduous and even makes the movie feel overlong at times; not good for a film which clocks in at a brisk 91 minutes. The film is in black & white, which works, but it's also in crisp deep-focus digital video, which gives it an amateurish sheen. It feels more like men playing dress-up than genuine period. The vaguely humourous bent of Reece Shearsmith and of Richard Glover (Friend) is welcome but, juxtaposed against the tiny cast and the zero-budget \"one-field\" location, it feels like an episode of The Comic Strip Presents.... And not one of the early classics, either. This is no A Fistful of Travellers' Cheques or Gino: Full Story and Pics. No, this feels more akin to Les Dogs or Spaghetti Hoops. With more knob-rot (this film was made for £300,000. Peanuts, relatively. But seriously, where has that money gone? I can't see it on the screen. Five mates, some fancy dress and an iPhone to record it on. Job done!).\r\n\r\nI've seen enough of Wheatley's output now to know that I like him, or rather, that I want to like him, but... hm. Something's not quite right, I fear. He struggles to get across fully what he wants to say, and then he appears to justify any lapses in narrative logic after the event. Kill List was brilliant but maddeningly incomplete. Subsequent interviews seemed to indicate to me that rather than being purposely enigmatic, he'd just lost more exposition than he really should have in the edit. In an interview on the DVD for A Field in England, he muses that AFiE serves as a sort-of unofficial prequel to Kill List, an origin story to the cult operating in that (superior) movie. But it appears to me as though that thought only really occurs to him as he's speaking.\r\n\r\nAll that said, it warrants at least a look. I doubt many are going to fall in love with A Field in England, whilst many ARE going to hate it. For much of its runtime, either nothing much is happening, or crazy weirdness is happening. But on those occasions when something IS happening, it definitely holds the interest. And the tiny cast is excellent; Michael Smiley, Reece Shearsmith and Richard Glover in particular. I'm going to rate A Field in England 6/10, which may rise to a 7 upon another viewing. . That I actually want to give it another viewing says something in and of itself, I think."

A couple largely going through the motions, living the same routine from day to day with neither really thinking about the quality of their lives. In this case it's Deborah Kerr (\"Cathy\") and husband \"Robert\" (Robert Donat) who are in this malaise. Along comes WWII, though, and the pair are separated and their existences given much more varied and dangerous twists which make their post-war reunification quite bumpy. Indeed, it doesn't take them very long to realise that they have very little in common any more, and that perhaps they ought to just divorce. There is bundles of chemistry between the two and with some almost sagely contributions from her pal \"Dizzy\" (Glynis Johns) alongside Ann Todd and Roland Culver we have a character led film that exasperates as it entertains. It's romantic, but not sentimental - and you frequently just want to bang their heads together. Nicely scored by Clifton Parker, it's a well made, slightly nostalgic, look at the curiously cathartic effects of upheaval - and is well worth a watch."

To add to his miseries, his ungrateful wretch of a godson - \"Ezar\" (Richard Ney) - proposes a wager that could indicate that women are every bit the equal of men - and he drags in the wily \"Zohara\" (Gypsy Rose Lee) to prove his point. What now ensues are a series of standard \"Arabian Nights\" style escapades with lots of veils, flowing dresses, and mischief as the poor old men are continually hoodwinked by their far more savvy antagonists. It's quite a breezy film with little effort made by anyone to enhance the rather basic look of it all. Wobbly sound stage sets and some truly wooden acting help to deliver the completely forgettable dialogue that passes eighty minutes before it ends and you forget all about it. It's not terrible, it's just a very light-weight attempt at comedy that has long since lost any punch it ever actually had."

A plane is expected to arrive at Tangiers airport carrying a lucrative cargo. When it crashes, burns out with no trace of any bodies the search begins. Who has the missing $3m? We have no shortage of suspects, nor of searchers. First amongst them is Palance \"Walker\", a decorated soldier who now dabbles in the black market then \"Susan\" (Joan Fontaine) who was the fiancée of the plane's pilot. Also on the hunt is the intended recipient - \"Danzer\" (Douglas) who intends to find his money and use it finance a transaction to ship warplanes back behind the Iron Curtain. \"Walker\" and \"Susan\" team up, with some idea where the treasure and the pilot are, and off they trek with both thugs and police in hot pursuit. When it is in adventure mode, this is quite well put together; the story is robust enough and the dialogue sparing (always a benefit for the usually wooden-as-planks Douglas and Palance), but all too frequently there are dreary romantic double plays involved - not least at the hands of Corrine Calvet's (\"Nicole\"). It can't quite make up it's mind who it is for, this film - and though the ending is quite exciting, for the most part it just seems to rumble along in second gear."

When he finds himself on the wrong end of a murder investigation, she must help him track down the true culprit. The thing about this film is the dialogue - it is relentless and after a while becomes quite irritating and largely humourless. Sure, it deals with alcoholism (and it's side effects) in a way that the code would soon discourage, but as he comes across as somewhat odious and the whole pace, though frenetic as you might expect in a 1920s newspaper office, goes nowhere fast for the vast majority of the film. Even the last fifteen minutes - in which everything of note occurs - doesn't really lift it. I just found myself a bit bored by it all and it seemed longer than it's 75 minutes."

Flippen. Music is by Leonard Rosenman and cinematography by Eugene Polito.\r\n\r\nTrail City, and 4 delinquent cowboys ride into town with attitude and carefree abandon. The Trail City residents - spineless, all except one man. One man who considers himself only half a man on account of his disability. That man is Civil War veteran Captain Sam...\r\n\r\nWar didn't just destroy his arm.\r\n\r\nThe few critical appraisals and reviews that exist for The Plunderers are keen to associate the picture with other notable pictures released previously, which in this instance is something of a curse when they happen to be well revered classics. Yet this is no knock off, it has its own identity. The four young delinquents here are not dashing dandy types, the makers make every effort to put their failings as human beings up at the front of the portrayals. These are young men, out of their depth, even spineless, but of course the town doesn't know this as they are too busy cowering in the shadows.\r\n\r\nThe messages are obvious in the play, but Pevney doesn't use his sledgehammer to enforce those parts of the narrative. It's perhaps no surprise how things pan out with Chandler's embittered war veteran, as he wrestles with both his conscience and his disability, but Pevney has a good knack for slow burning the atmosphere to bring rewards for film's finale. Chandler, in his last Western, is suitably broody, Hunt and Hart are beauties to behold, while of the bad boys it's Saxon as a diabolical Mexican - with scary eyebrows - and the only one who is old enough to shave, who strikes the highest villain chords.\r\n\r\nElsewhere there's a great musical score provided by double Academy Award Winner Rosenman, very much akin to something that the moody Twilight Zone episodes would use. It also at times has the feel of the score Alan Silvestri would rustle up for Predator some 27 years later. Polito's photography is crisp, where in conjunction with Pevney's camera angles and lighting techniques keeps the claustrophobia factor high in this one location setting.\r\n\r\nCrackerjack! A dandy of a black and white Oater waiting to be discovered by more Western fans. It's a keeper for sure. 8/10"

Or perhaps because it came out of the low-budget Republic Pictures? It's simply just a forgotten one. So much so you will be hard pushed to see it mentioned on any Christmas film lists that flourish around the yuletide season. The film is based around an original story written by Frances Hyland and Albert Ray and concerns a sophisticated family inviting a washed up actor to their home for Christmas. As things progress we learn that this family are using the holiday season to secure a rich uncle's inheritance, but naturally all is not going to be plain sailing. \r\n\r\nHeading the cast list is Joseph Schildkraut (The Shop Around the Corner), Billie Burke (The Wizard of Oz) and Eugene Palette (The Ghost Goes West). It's directed by Republic house jobber Joseph Kane, with photography and scoring coming from Reggie Lanning & Walter Scharf respectively. \r\n\r\nSo is the film any good though? Well it's safe to say that anyone looking for another old Christmas movie to boost the crimble spirit can safely add this one to their rota. It's very much in the mold of the likes of The Bishops Wife, which of course is no bad thing at all as a point of reference. My chief irk with the picture is that it flatters to deceive. By the midpoint the film has all options open to it, even threatening to be darker and perhaps leaning towards an ending of some surprise. But sadly, and without me crying out for any Pottersville type misery here, the film reverts to type and settles for a warm mince pie and a glass of mulled wine. Again, that's no bad thing at the season we choose to watch it in, but really it promised to be something more. \r\n\r\nStill, it's a comfortable recommendation for the heart warming seeker. 6/10"

A bit of magic and a bit about the cat's story, it ends up just becoming a standard lacklustre and predictable villain-centric plot."

        "content": "The kinetic super-spy caper ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ will serve as a boisterous blueprint for those teen fanboys out there that will fancy an elaborate overload of James Bond-esque high-powered hedonism. It certainly does not hurt that the high-wire hysteria as showcased in the twitchy ‘Kingman’ is based upon the acclaimed comicbook series by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. Also, add into the mix the movie-making overdrive pedigree of director Matthew Vaughn (‘Kick-Ass’, ‘X-Men: First Class’) and slick, cheeky spy-spry send-ups that recall the over-the-top espionage genre and its exaggerated suspense-driven foundation. Well, ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ is a cockeyed, pulsating parody that works its ultra-violent magic for the Austin Powers crowd that wants to walk on the high-octane wild side of Bond’s universe.\r\n\r\nSure, ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ has its iffy moments where the blatant sexist overtones, magnified violent sequences and a generous bloody bounce of excess will have some stomping their feet in sheer indignation. The apparent knock on ‘Kingsman’ will be its robust ridiculousness and familiarity in Vaughn’s ‘Kick-Ass’ cartoonish vibe. However, the same elements that may cause some reservations with the film’s low-brow lunacy is also the same ingredients that trigger ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’s carousing charm in majestic mayhem.\r\n\r\nThe grand gimmick behind behind kick-starting ‘Kingsman’s go-for-broke rollicking is casting the sophisticated presence of the Oscar-winning Colin Firth (‘The King’s Speech’) as dapper Harry Hart (aka ‘Galahad’), a polished and prominent superspy for a British secret intelligence society.  Hart’s top-secret spy network is headed up by Arthur (Oscar-winner Michael Caine). The secretive operation is based out of a notable tailor’s shop known as Kingsman. Also worth noting is that all the secret service agents are named after the famed knights of King Arthur’s Round Table. Go figure. In any event, the suave Harry Hart is the debonair face of the spy organisation and will play a critical part in both recruiting a young up-and-coming agent with decent physical skills and tracking down a worldwide menace bent of destroying the planet. It is all in a day’s work for the skilled, well-dressed licensed-to-kill operative.\r\n\r\nHart, who had been loyally connected to a fallen colleague from a past mission gone disastrous years before, decides to become a mentor for his late co-worker’s troubled son Gary ‘Eggsy’ Unwin (played by newcomer Taron Egerton) whose law-breaking conduct catches the attention of the police. Feeling a sense of responsibility for his deceased spy buddy’s wayward kid, Hart takes Eggsy under his wings and determines to shape the misguided youngster into resilient Kingman stock. After all, Eggsy has the needed physicality (we are told he is an exceptional gymnast) and roguish spunk to join the ranks of the seemingly understaffed spy outfit. Soon, Eggy and other recruits will be grilled through rigorous training from Kingman member Merlin (Mark Strong) as they look to fill the spot vacated recently from the dead Lancelot.\r\n\r\nThe dearly departed Lancelot, it turns out, was the latest victim of ruthless criminal mastermind Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). The flashy Valentine, a billionaire gone bonkers, hopes to control the world’s climate change. He is known as a mega-wealthy entrepreneur and philanthropist but his sinister heart yearns for some heavy-handed dastardly deeds that puts him on the immediate radar for Hart and his crafty Kingsmen to spring into action. At the demented Valentine’s side is the deliciously disabled exotic henchwoman Gazelle (Sophia Boutella) with the treacherous knack for disarming her adversaries with blazing blades.\r\n\r\nThe bombastic and eye-pleasing ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ sets out to have one goal in mind: to highlight its thunderous homage to spygate spectacles that salute everything from the Agent 007 flicks and related free-wheeling 60’s fare such as the ‘Matt Helm’ and ‘Derek Flint’ spy franchises to the recent espionage vehicles that invite the millennium-based harried heroes such as the Jason Bournes and Jack Ryans of the world into the frenetic fold.  It is fast, furious and unapologetic in its rambunctious spirit as a ricocheting romp.\r\n\r\nVaughn, in all his rousing Tarantino-esque tactics, unleashes a visceral assault that is visually wrapped in his escapist package of an adrenaline rush. Wisely, Vaughn incorporates some of his ‘Kick-Ass’ colourful calisthenics to arm his playful spy yarn. As the veteran spygame squires, both Firth and Caine are game for the frolic they signed up to participate in with puckish aplomb. Jackson brings his usual explosive badass persona to the table as the villainous fashion plate Valentine. The 14 year-old males will draw their adventurous inspiration from Egerton’s junior spy Eggsy Unwin. Some may become nostalgic when uncovering the likes of spotting ‘Star Wars’ icon Mark Hamill as an imperiled climate changer scientist caught in the crazy clutches of Jackson’s diabolical antagonist. \r\n\r\nAlthough not the most inventive take on ridiculing the spy genre with over-extended finesse and sensationalism, ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ is still a preferred jolting distraction at the beginning of an early stillborn movie season.\r\n\r\nKingman: The Secret Service (2015)\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\n1 hr. 40 min.\r\n\r\nStarring: Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Michael Caine, Samuel L.

Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by Taron Egerton) is a normal working class 18 year old from London who gets recruited into a super secret spy organisation. Humour comes as he tries to mix with these posh and suave upper-class stereotypes.\r\n\r\nMatthew Vaughn has included his typical ultra stylised violence ('Kick Ass') and it does boast a good sound track. There are a lot of nods to films such as Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' but it just reminds me of examples when things have been done much better. The highlight of the film for me was a scene in which Colin Firth violently massacres a crazy church to the music of Lynyrd Skynyrd ('Free Bird') whilst almost seeming like a continuous long shot.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is very unoriginal and the dialogue with the young actors in particular is cringe-worthy. Tarantino type set-pieces just come across as annoying as the film fails to have any cleverness or creativity.\r\n\r\nApart from Colin Firth every actor is either average or just really bad. Samuel L. Jackson, in particular, is worse than usual as he tries to add some freshness to his regular spiel by trying to affect an annoying and distracting speech impediment.\r\n\r\n'Kingsman' is going to appeal to the intended target age group as it does contain scenes of fantasy violence depicted as \"cool\" whilst characters swear. It would also help your enjoyment of the film if you have not seen the many, many examples where each scene had been conducted much better.\r\n\r\n★★½"

It is a bit more outrageous and has a few more overly silly moments than the old Bond movies but on the whole this is a very fun and enjoyable secret agent movie.\r\n\r\nGary is, via a few twists and turns at the beginning of the movie, recruited by a secret agent employed by a super secret private organisation with remarkable resources. Their agents looks and behaves like London upper class gentlemen but have remarkable fighting skills. The initial scenes when Gary is recruited are just great.\r\n\r\nGary is then submitted to a rather gruesome training schedule and at the same time the main plot plays out in parallell. Of course the two threads merge towards the classical showdown with the megalomaniacal evil mastermind in the end where, naturally, Gary gets to save the world.\r\n\r\nThe movie has all the “goodies” of a secret agent movie. British gentlemen agents, action, secret agent “stuff” like shops that are not what they look like, hidden entrances into secret bases, rooms that are actually elevators and of course gadgets, lots of gadget to help our heroes thwart the evil mastermind’s nefarious plans. Of course said mastermind have a personal henchman a la Oddjob to do the more grisly parts of his evil biddings. I quite liked this rather unique henchman, or rather henchwoman, and her odd weapons. More so than the main villain which I found a bit bland at times.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoyed this movie a lot. However, there are some silly parts which drags it down a bit. I especially disliked the colorful exploding heads towards the end of the movie. That just felt like the producer/director was smoking some funny stuff when making those scenes. There were a few other scenes which I felt was going too much towards silly comedies as well. Without those I would probably have added a star.\r\n\r\nAll things said this was well spent 130 minutes as far as I am concerned."

He is the young \"Eggsy\" who lives with his mum (Samantha Womack) and her gangster boyfriend \"Dean\" (Geoff Bell). After a pretty daring altercation with his goons, the youngster ends up in a police station where he remembers a gift that was given to his mother when his father mysteriously died. He calls a number, is duly sprung and introduced to the dapper \"Harry Hart\" (Colin Firth) who quickly enrols him in a school that isn't for the faint hearted. Survival here is just the start of his adventures as he is quickly embroiled in a world-domination scheme being hatched by gazillionaire \"Valentine\" (Samuel L. Jackson) - aided by his lethal-limbed hench-woman \"Gazelle\" (Sofia Boutella). Luckily he has the sagely \"Merlin\" (Mark Strong) and the versatile \"Roxy\" (Sophie Cookson) to help him - but can he thwart the dastardly plan? Jeopardy isn't high on director Matthew Vaughn's priority lists here, but entertainment and plenty of fun action-escapades are, and they deliver well. Firth is on fine form as the deadly but debonaire mentor; Sir Michael Caine adds a soupçon of class to the proceedings and Jackson looks like he is having fun in his bright red Converse trainers. It does take just a shade too long to get going, but Egerton works really well as the cheeky chappy with a brain in his head and a solid sense of common decency - particularly useful when he is facing overwhelming odds and doom lies menacingly before him. It's a great looking film, the visual effects are used sparingly and all told this is a characterful, well-written, and good fun yarn that still tips it's hat to the espionage genre - but in a playful and slightly mischievous way. Good fun."

Music is by Hans Salter and cinematography by Maury Gertsman.\r\n\r\nFrenchie Fontaine (Winters) has sold her successful business in New Orleans and has come West to prosper further - or does she have an ulterior motive?\r\n\r\nIn spite of some on line sources proclaiming this to be a remake of \"Destry\", which is a considerably better film as it happens, it really isn't a copy. The similarities are for sure there, but it is its own entity and deserves to at least be judged as such.\r\n\r\nWe have a wonderful tried and trusted Western genre narrative thread where someone is out for revenge, only in this instance it's a foxy lady. Male suitors get in a tizzy about garnering her attentions, the bad guys potter about trying to avert suspicion - but do so badly, and there's some moral outrage from townsfolk who object to Frenchie's forthright money making success. While of course there's some truths to be born out - can open and worms everywhere type of thing.\r\n\r\nIt's not very strong on the page, that's for sure, but there's plenty in the production to enjoy regardless. Cast are good value for the roles as written, not that there's any great chemistry between Winters and McCrea, but as she snake hips her way around town, and he fronts up with cool as a cucumber swagger, it's easy to just buy into the frothery of it all. The dialogue is often deliciously suggestive, the costuming is high quality (Yvonne Wood), and when action decides to make an appearance it's competently staged.\r\n\r\nYet it's the cinematography that is the pic's best aspect. Maury Gertsman (Comanche Territory) is not a name that jumps off the page for cinematography notices, he definitely was a better purveyor in monochrome, but his Technicolor filters are excellent here. Then there's the gorgeous locales, where Buttermilk Country/Inyo National Forest please the eyes so much you wonder why these weren't used more often through the Western genre heydays?\r\n\r\nAs a serious Western genre fan I wouldn't be comfortable putting this forward as a must see for like minded souls. However, for McCrea and Winters fans - and actually John Russell ones as well - this is no waste of time. 6/10"

When the latter is injured by a backfiring shotgun, his distant cousin has to step in and help keep the ship on an even keel whilst the \"Princess Theresa\" (Jody Lawrence) arrives for a betrothal ceremony, The king's cousin \"Ramón\" (Anthony Quinn) is clearly the man behind the plotting - and you just know he isn't going to stop now! It has a few, minor, deviations from the better established story but otherwise it's a dead ringer. Baxter is dapper enough, and the thing looks grand and sumptuous, but there is more gel in Quinn's hair than between the two stars and the ending sees the most sedate sword fight I think I have ever seen. The production is really basic - the opening few scenes with a back-lit screen as they nod and sway on their non-existent horses does raise a smile. I didn't hate it, but it did make me appreciate Messrs. Fairbanks and Granger an whole lot more."

Rather unrealistically, I thought, he gives him his address and next day - equally unsuprisingly, he has a few unexpected visitors who completely implausibly clear out his house around him after have drank his booze and eaten his food. At this point I was ready to turn this off! I didn't though, and I am glad. Next day, \"Daniel\" answers the door to the young rent boy - alone, this time - and over the remaining course of the film we follow the two as they begin to bond. The former man realises that his new toy-boy is, at heart, a decent lad who has moved from desperate circumstances in the Ukraine and fallen into bad company in an hostel dominated by the \"boss\" (Daniil Vorobyov). There is a degree of chemistry between the two here, and we do - after that rather ropey start - begin to feel just a little invested in the youngster as his character develops and his personality and integrity are encouraged by an older man who initially just wanted sex, but who quickly realises that more could be on offer - for both of them, here. It takes quite a swipe at immigration policies, of bullying and of crime whilst offering us performances that emit just the slightest glimmer of hope and aspiration. It's far, far too long - and Robin Campillo really ought to have been far more savage with the digital razor blade at the start, but once it's up and running it develops an impetus to it that makes it engaging to watch."

Top billing goes to the rather sterile Randolph Scott (\"Redfern\") who, with his pals \"Evans\" (Bill Williams) & \"Ling\" (Lee Tung Foo) encounter old-timer \"Grizzly\" as they head into British Colombia with some farming and gold-panning on their minds. They are not there for long, though, before local cattle baron \"Walsh\" (Victor Jory) and his men stampede their cattle causing \"Evans\" an injury that costs him his arm - and costs the operating \"Redfern\" their friendship. Now facing hostility from just about every side, his only hope is to find some gold in them thar hills. Karin Booth provides the occasional, and lively, love interest - a shrinking violet she isn't, and the rest of the narrative follows a well trammelled storyline peppered with the odd gunfight, before quite an exciting head-to-head. Aside from the rather wooden Scott, this features quite a characterful cast with enough action and a minimum of romance and wordy dialogue to pass eighty minutes amongst some fine cinematography (Colorado not BC) enjoyably enough."

Not because both the movies are about tornadoes, but takes place in a similar fashion where a group of twister/storm analyzers/chasers goes after their thing only to come out in a messed-up state. Forget the 'Twister', lets talk about this film. It had better effects, but that did not give the visuals like the natural occurrence, mostly they over-used it. I can call it a display for commercial purpose than reality, that's what Hollywood is famous for, isn't it?\r\n\r\nThe fun part was, the tornado(es) behaved like it had a soul and conscious like any living organism. 'Final Destination 5' was one of the best digital 3D movie at that time, when it comes to the awesome pop-ups and very disappointed with this film which was crafted by the same director.\r\n\r\nThe plus point was, it mildly entertains with a merely good pace of narration. Definitely it is not a category-A movie, if you want, you can say it because of the actors. The real reason is the performances from the cast was not noticeable. If one, one person had a strong hold up on his role the movie might had clinched its success. Due to CGI rule, actors are not getting a better scope for their characters. That's very sad, but true. You can watch it for entertainment or timepass, but not expecting seriously.\r\n\r\n5.5/10"

        "content": "The musical begins with a human chess board; women and men dressed in black or white. These are the dancers who are present in most scenes. While the game of chess is played there is a voice over of William T. Spears asking people not to take photos or use mobile phones, etc. during the performance.\r\n\r\nA large covered object is wheeled out and then people in cloaks and masks appear, Ciel speaks. A man speaks about the evening to the crowd before revealing the sacrificial lamb, Ciel, in the cage. Sebastian's voice interrupts and he appears on the third upper level of the stage wearing a cape and begins singing the first song- Keiyaku . While singing and descending the stairs he pulls off something similar to fight that is part of the choreography. While dancing he is killing the humans as he goes. Eventually the cage is covered again and once Sebastian reaches the bottom of the stage he walks towards the front of the stage with his cape extended at arms length on both sides. As he moves we see Ciel clutching his rags behind him, the brand is on his back. The scene resembles a recent flashback in the manga to that time of the making of the contract, as Sebastian stands behind Ciel and places his right arm around the boy's shoulders. They talk briefly (same deal as the manga/anime about the contract) and then Sebastian takes off his glove revealing the contract symbol and a giant curtain/banner falls from the ceiling of the contract symbol.\r\n\r\nThe next scene is in the Phantomhive mansion, a lovely chandelier comes down in to sight, similar to the ones Yana drew on the musical's promotional art. Sebastian helps Ciel who is sitting on a bed get dressed and asks what he would like for breakfast. Ciel requests the paper and focuses on a particular mystery story about women being killed. The servants interrupt, trying to kill/catch a mouse with Bard's large bazooka. While trying to protect Ciel they seem to cause more trouble for him then Sebastian snatches the mouse and throws it in a way like he is playing baseball. The servants praise Sebastian who just scolds them, as they get back to their work Mey Rin passes on a letter to Sebastian. A letter from Her Majesty about the recent murders.\r\n\r\nNext the four main Grim Reapers appear on the top level of the stage- Ronald, William, Eric and Alan. Each has their death scythe and they appear that they are just returning from work. The other Grim Reaper that run around frantically to prepare the office greet them before taking their scythes and handing them paperwork. Grell appears seeking attention but is ignored. William leads the group in to the next song- Shinigami Haken Kyoukai(Grim Reaper dispatch department). Some of the lyrics include the Grim Reaper list of rules. After the song ends William sends Alan on the case (regarding the missing souls) despite it previously being Grell's case. Eric offers to be his back up, Alan seems like he doesn't want back up and we later find out why, he is actually really good friends with Eric but he has an illness that is basically interfering with his work as a Grim Reaper. He probably wants to look strong in front of his peers, hence the not wanting backup. Grell is upset that the others are assigned to his case as it now involves Sebastian. He rushes off ignoring William when Alan and Eric and leaves also. Ronald and William closes the scene discussing Eric and Alan's close relationship.\r\n\r\nWe find ourselves in London now and a group of people surround a crime scene. Aberline is wandering around when a reporter repeatedly seeks his attention, the man asks if he is from Scotland Yard. Abberline is angered when the man (Sharp Hanks) calls him \"Underline\" but the two eventually become friends when Hanks calls him \"ago no line\", they have things in common like their small facial hair/chins, Hanks was also always told that his chin looks like an ass. They become the duo \"Abberline Sharp/ago no line Sharp\" which is the ongoing joke about their chins because their names together like that are a pun in Japanese. Ciel and Sebastian arrive and Ciel repeatedly tries to get Aberline's attention but he is too busy playing with Sharp's facial hair. Eventually he realizes it is Ciel and they talk about the case a bit. When Abberline begins introducing Ciel, Hanks launches into a giant spiel noting every detail about Ciel, his job as the Queen's watchdog and even what he preferred for breakfast. Sebastian makes a correction and Abberline tells Sharp to write it down in his notebook. While Abberline and Sharp carry on they fail to realize that Ciel and Sebastian have already left but zoom off like aeroplanes happily together after hugging/bowing and doing random poses.\r\n\r\nCiel and Sebastian appear on the second level and discuss visiting Undertaker. Sebastian jokes around, he strikes a pose while calling out \"Abberline Sharp (ago no line Sharp)\" after saying that his chin is sharper. Some coffins are wheeled out on the lower floor. Ciel calls to Undertaker who emerges from a coffin. When seeking information Ciel orders Sebastian to make Undertaker laugh, he crouches a bit with his legs spread and shoves his hands down in between looking really proud of himself. It might have been some sort of Kamen Rider or Super Sentai henshin pose. Undertaker didn't find it funny anyway much to Sebastian's disappointment. Undertaker mentions wanting some love and Ciel orders Sebastian to somehow give it to him. Sebastian asks for the music to start and it does. Some dancers carrying large feathers appear and wave them around him. Sebastian has a little microphone and performs to Undertaker, he is typically seductive. I didn't really notice it until my friend pointed it out but Yuya is singing this one mostly in Osaka-ben. Undertaker crawls around longingly on the floor while Sebastian sings and gets mixed up in the feathers. He enjoys it a lot and gives up some information at the end. He mentions that someone involved in the murders is not a human.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Ciel and Sebastian start singing Black and White. They are cut off when Eric and Alan appear wielding their death scythes. Sebastian tells Ciel that they are Grim Reapers and protectively leads him away. Eric concludes that he must be Sebastian. Alan attacks Sebastian but suffers an attack from his illness half way through, Eric rushes to his side. Grell has appeared off to the side, he explains Alan's illness (thorns of death). Sebastian says that the group can go back to the Phantomhive house much to Grell's excitement, he attempts to run and glomp Sebastian who neatly side steps him. Two women appear (in fact they lurk in the background throughout the musical) one sings opera style while the other dances. Alan and Eric are struggling to get Alan to the house, the dancer circles Alan who seems to want to follow her though she is unseen. It appears as though she is his illness personified.\r\n\r\nEventually we find Alan in a bed with Eric reading a book beside him. Alan wakes and argues with Eric that he is okay, he is clearly upset. Alan sings a song while Eric sits on the bed, he is visibly troubled by Alan's problem and looks frustrated.\r\n\r\nGrell appears on the second level wearing women's lingerie and a rope tied around himself. He's excited to be sleeping over and of course he has plans for Sebastian. He removes his high heels and the rope before singing a seductive song that involves a bit of a pole dance, people dirty dancing (2 girls together, 2 sets of 2 guys together and a hetero pair). Grell removes the woman from the hetero pair and does a little suggestive dancing of his own before heading off and being followed by the guy who he kicks aside. When the song ends Grell bumps in to Sebastian which sends the surprised Grim Reaper to the floor. Sebastian tells Grell where he can find the bathroom but he nags Sebastian to wait. Sebastian plays along a bit and picks up the high heels. He pokes them at Grell's chest sending the Grim Reaper in to a rather amusing frenzy. He screams for Sebastian to stop and pushes him to the floor. Sebastian is surprised and Grell cowers to the side muttering about how he hasn't even shaved/waxed but Sebastian soon leads him away. The demon nods towards the rope on the floor which Grell picks up and it is wrapped around him. Sebastian hooks a high heel through the rope and drags the Grim Reaper off while not paying much attention, Grell ends up being slammed in to a pole but they keep going as the servants enter the lower level and start setting up the table for breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe servants are really enthusiastic with their guests Eric and Alan. Eventually Ciel and Sebastian arrive followed by Grell. Grell is walking like he's been beat up and looks like he has had a rough night. He mentions that he had a hot night with Sebastian who asks him to stop saying such disgusting things. The servants and Ciel are looking at Sebastian seeking an explanation but he just keeps shaking his head. Sebastian confronts Eric about being the criminal and provides a list of suspects before explaining how he narrowed it down due to the scent. Eric attacks Sebastian who is given Grell's chainsaw scythe. When Alan called him, Eric is distracted and sliced by Sebastian, everything goes dark and the projection of cinematic record appears. We see a scene of Eric killing women before returning to the action. Eric ends up leaving and Alan chases after him.\r\n\r\nWe find ourselves again on a London street while Abberline and Sharp question people. A woman waits for a friend while the suspicious person we saw earlier (as the murders were being explained in the Queen's letter scene there was a scene on the upper level of the women being knocked out by a man with a cloth covered in some drug/chemical). The man targets the women while Eric watches on from the upper level.\r\n\r\nThe next scene, two women that were drugged, both have been tied up and wear only their under garments. Druitt (who was the mysterious man) appears and starts going crazy with a whip. He asks the girls to make cute noises (bird noises) and isn't happy with what they come up with, he requests \"chun chun\". They finally say it nicely enough for him and he begins to sing. The song gets very Queen-like (rock n roll) when he is passed a microphone on a stick. A dancer accompanies him and the girls flutter around like birds (robins? lol) but end up back where they were at the end. Eric appears and cuts the girls loose after they beg for his help. Druitt rushes at Eric but finds the Grim Reaper's scythe at his neck. Eric begins singing a song, meanwhile Druitt plays with the girls while they attempt to escape much to his own amusement. It seems that Druitt loves the way that Eric slaughters the women, he thinks it's beautiful. Eric's reason for dealing with Druitt involves the Viscount's ability to gather a large amount of women easily. Alan arrives and confronts Eric, the two have a little fight but Alan has another attack of his illness allowing Eric the time to punch him. Alan drops to the floor as Eric and Druitt leave. Sebastian shows up behind Alan.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Ronald appear on the top level talking about what has been happening, on the bottom floor the servants, Ciel, Sebastian, Alan and Grell have gathered. Ciel is given another letter, this time it's an invitation to Druitt's opera. While Grell desperately tries to get a look at it Bard reads the rules, women and children only, men can come if they are accompanied by a woman. Ciel initially threw the invite on the ground but in the end he decides to go as it seems suspicious; Druitt is involved with Eric and the murder cases involve only female victims. Meanwhile Hanks and Abberline also decide to infiltrate the opera. Crystal palace is named as the location. The song that Sebastian and Ciel started earlier continues with everyone singing before the curtain falls and there is a 20 min break.\r\n\r\nWhen we come back the lights are out and we hear the familiar corset scene taking place only this time it gets pushed a little further. Grell's voice appears amongst the others and the lights come on to reveal him wearing a black and red dress. He criticizes Ciel's dress and jumps from the platform. Bard, Finny and Mey Rin are a little shocked, Bard is having the most trouble dealing. Sebastian says that he will pair with Ciel and Grell can pair with Alan. Alan ends that possibility by running out in a dress. He has decided that he should disguise himself in order to find Eric easier as he would be easily recognized by his friend if he weren't in a disguise. Grell doesn't approve and tries to rip the dress from him. The servants are told that they too can come to the opera which causes a lot of excitement.\r\n\r\nBefore the opera begins we meet Aberline who is also wearing a dress, he is joined by Hanks who too has put on a dress. Druitt introduces the opera which begins with an amazing singer and a hunched over man in a creepy mask beside her. Everyone is enjoying the opera while Alan searches for Eric. When the opera singer stops singing everyone is confused but the hunchback man winds her up from the back like a doll and she starts singing again. Alan spots Eric and the next time the opera singer stops singing the servants happily count the number of winds but nothing happens. Suddenly a kind of gas is leaked in and there are loud noises so everyone is in chaos trying to escape. The hunchback man picks up his doll and carries her away. Ronald and William show up and a huge group fight breaks out while the opera singer sings from the second level. The lawnmower in action was quite fun to watch as was the brief fight between William and Sebastian. Ronald is called off by William eventually, Eric has captured Ciel and leaves with his scythe at the his neck. Sebastian goes to free Ciel while Alan goes after Eric.\r\n\r\nEric is seen running and Alan appears on the upper level (no longer in a dress), he confronts Eric about the murders. Eric was killing women on behalf of Alan, there is a legend that if you collect the spirit power of 1000 pure souls then you can possibly heal the illness Alan has. Alan seems to forgive Eric quite easily when he tells him that it was on his behalf. They decide to run away together and leave their glasses behind signifying their resignation as Grim Reapers.\r\n\r\nNext we see Sebastian approaching Ciel who is tied up. Sebastian is wearing glasses (like when he wears the tutor outfit) and really enjoys mocking Ciel who shuffles forward on the floor. Yana Toboso wrote the scene which made it more interesting for me personally. Sebastian claims that he is too kind to Ciel and wonders if he should punish him like the governess used to or if he should spank him, at this point he puts Ciel over his lap and raises a hand. After Ciel barks like a dog and mews like a cat he has had enough of Sebastian's joking around and orders the demon to free him.\r\nWhile Alan and Eric are running Alan suffers another attack but tells Eric he is okay. Sebastian appears and sings another song, meanwhile cloaked people arrive and attack Eric who tries to escape them (I'm not sure who they are meant to be but they seem to be a personified representation of Eric's guilt/crimes catching up with him, or maybe the angry souls of all the people he has killed, like I said, I'm not sure). Eric fights the cloaked figures off before Sebastian sends them away, Ciel shows up in his regular clothes. Eric targets Ciel but Alan steps in front (Alan had previously called out reminding Eric that he promised not to kill anyone else), he is cut by Eric's death scythe and the cinematic record starts again.\r\nThere is a flashback with Eric and Alan from the time when Alan was still a new Grim Reaper and Eric was his senior. The dialogue between the two is really, really friendly, they act more like lovers than friends (Sebastian and others comment on their relationship throughout the musical) though we are always presented with the word friendship. They sing a song together and then things return to the time that Alan was cut. Now that Eric's mission is pointless he breaks down and mourns his friend. Eric had decided to give every up to try and cure Alan and now it was all for nothing. Sebastian finishes Eric off with Alan's death scythe (after asking Eric if he thinks he should as maybe he doesn't want Alan's scythe tainted with his dirty soul). Eric's body falls to rest on Alan's, fake snow starts pouring from the sky, it's said to be the souls of the people that Eric killed/collected being released, they shine like snow hence the most beautiful death in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the end we see Abberline talking with Undertaker, Aberline and Hanks talking and William discussing things with Ronald. Ronald wonders if not, then, why didn't the demon take any of the souls escaping Eric. William tells him that he will have the child's soul.\r\n\r\nFinally we are back at the Phantomhive house. The servants welcome Sebastian and Ciel home. Ciel falls asleep in his chair while drinking tea and Sebastian sings Hallucination. He picks up Ciel and carries him to the front of the stage. The demonic music we heard at the start returns and everything gets darker. Sebastian talks while Ciel sleeps in his arms, Yana wrote these lines also and they're typically Sebastian. Sebastian says that he doesn't need 1000 souls, there is just one that he wants/needs, and that is his young masters. It all ends with Sebastian's famous line \"akumade shitsuji desu kara\"; the large banner with the contract symbol falls from the roof again."

We begin as the team travel through the lower Himalayan plateau where they encounter all sorts of people, animals and customs. This stage, for me, was far more interesting. It's depiction of a civilisation that on one hand bathed their children in butter (to help insulate against the cold) whilst building some of the most amazing architecture nestling, like eyries, amidst the mountains - frequently looking like they had been hewn from the rock itself - was quite bewitching. The general contentment and hospitality of and offered by the local population is writ large as this group move through their territory until they reach the foothills (still 20,000-odd feet above sea level) and their ascent starts in earnest. Using some remarkable long-lens photography we get a sense of the scale of their operation, and of it's perilous nature. There is little by way of photography of the latter stages of their trip, but what we do see really did make me reach for a jumper and wonder what on earth could ever drive people to undertake such a venture. It hasn't as much going on as with the Shackleton or Scott films, but is still well worth appreciating."

The story of a 16 year old boy, Jay, from Scotland embarks a journey in the New World in search of his love, Rose. Later a bounty hunter joins him and makes sure his safe travel. Technically, it was a road movie, but reveals the plot from the other angles as well in the spare times like during camping at the nights.\r\n\r\nThe narration was too slow and the story was ordinary, but it was enough for me to get engaged. If you wait until the final scene, especially till you figure out the puzzle of the romance theme, you may like it better. The end was so good, just like what a western movie fan looking for, a gunfight. Interestingly, that was not to be heroic, except all the earlier disasters pushed for the finale and the post finale. It is rated R, because it is so brutal in some way and for being faithful to the genre.\r\n\r\nIt might not be a dream debut for the director like the big cast, the high budget and a great commercial success, but giving a satisfying movie in a simple way was his accomplishment in his first attempt. Kodi Smith-McPhee is almost 20 and he's yet to play his independent and powerful enough character that will bring acknowledgement. It was a close one, the narration started like it was his, and he was everywhere in the movie. Then going further, especially when it nears the end, he was kind of fading. But he was awesome, along with Michael Fassbender. Not a must see, as well as not refusable if you get a chance to see it.\r\n\r\n7.5/10"

It stars Kodi Smit-McPhee, Michael Fassbender, Ben Mendelsohn, Caren Pistorius and Rory McCann. Music is by Jed Kurzel and cinematography by Robbie Ryan.\r\n\r\nIt's the late 1800s and a teenage Scottish aristocrat travels to the American West to track down the girl he loves with all his heart...\r\n\r\nThere has been a number of modern day directors who have not only refused to let the Western genre die, but also to not be afraid to take it to a harshness of the West level. They have chosen to strip it back to a sense of realism, with no frills and bunting, just a show of tough times populated by tough people and people tough out of luck. Slow West is one such Oater.\r\n\r\nFor his first full length feature, John Maclean has chosen to make a genre of film he clearly knows something about. It's got some familiar tropes - greenhorn, grizzled bounty hunter, deadly gang et al, but Maclean has still made a fresh picture, one that not only intrigues and excites, but also humours by way of some black comedy inserts.\r\n\r\nEssentially it's a travelogue piece, McPhee's lovelorn Jay Cavendish ends up being escorted on his journey by Fassbender's mysterious tough guy Silas Selleck. It's an odd yet engaging pairing, and as they are pursued by Selleck's old gang, and they come across a number of eccentric or devious characters, you may find yourself hoping that all the hidden agendas - the secrets bubbling away in the background - do not shatter the surrogate relationship neither was looking for.\r\n\r\nHis heart was in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nAh, but yes! Maclean shows gumption to go all mud and blood on our butts, building everything to a quite terrific final quarter of film that has rode in on a black stallion straight from noirville. No printing the legend here, it's a bitter commentary on the romanticised view of the Old West. Western fans keen of ear will pick up on some historically spiky dialogue exchanges, whilst also noting the nods towards the immigration angles, where Maclean doesn't pull punches as to how desperate the Old West was for many of those who travelled hoping for a better life.\r\n\r\nPredominantly filmed in New Zealand (superbly standing in for the American West), the panoramic cinematography is stunning, while it's great to see the backdrops are not just mountainous desert scapes, this journey goes through forestry as well. Cast are on prime form, Fassbender seems to be a given these days and it's hoped he will do a Western again, and McPhee plays off of him with genuine conviction. Then there's Mendelsohn, who has to be one of the finest Australian character actors working today, he's perfectly cast here, so his fans know exactly what they will be getting.\r\n\r\nThe poster art is hugely frustrating, showing Caren Pistorius with a big beaming smile on her face, that is very much a bum steer. You would be wise to take more note of the faces of Messrs McPhee, Fassbender and Mendelsohn on that poster, for their facial portraits are more in keeping with this cracker-jack Western. 9/10"

As he goes about his business, he has to stay two steps ahead of the police and his military employers who want their lethal weapon back.\r\n\r\nSlow justice is better than no justice.\r\n\r\nOK! Lets cut to the chase here, this is ultimately a gruesome revenge picture, the only thing new on offer here is the methods of the executions administered by the seriously brooding Jimmy Vickers. This adherence to formula, a basic modern update of the Death Wish filmic telling of a tale, is enough to send many critics scurrying around for their most poisonous pens with which to articulate their venom. Add in the Danny Dyer factor, a fella who strangely seems to rile so many in entertainment circles purely because of the genre branches of entertainment he works in, then Vendetta was never going to garner favourable reviews in many quarters.\r\n\r\nThis isn't revenge. This is a necessity.\r\n\r\nYet there's a question that springs to mind here, namely, what were they expecting? Tag lines and media headings said Danny Dyer enacts bloody revenge on the murderers of his parents because the law is an ass! Do critics and film fans really go into a film like this, one that isn't hiding under false pretences, expecting a scathing and intelligent observation on the lawlessness of Britain? Or a snarky aside to the failings of the law system? Seriously? Stephen Reynolds (writer and director) has put some thought into his picture, there are some potent passages of dialogue, even if they fall by the wayside as the kills come thick and fast, but it was never marketed to the highbrow seekers.\r\n\r\nYou'll be demoted before you can say Katie Price is a virgin.\r\n\r\nVendetta delivers the goods for those looking for a good night in with a beer and some blood and brooding on the screen. Dyer (a real nice bloke in real life) gives good value as a son hell bent on revenge, whilst he also doesn't look out of place in his fight scenes. Haider Zafar's cinematography is superb, the blues and golds magnetic in their visual appeal, and there's good and solid work done by the supporting cast. \r\n\r\nVendetta has fans, it really does, so much so that a sequel is currently in production. That news is sure to send those critics sitting up there in their ivory towers at The Guardian and The Telegraph crying over their shrimp salads. But you can bet your last British pound that they will be going to view the sequel expecting a far different movie to the one the man and woman of the street knows they are going to get. Death by cement! Hooray! 7/10"

        "content": "Look…one can never have enough time travel movies for our escapist needs, correct? After all, the possibilities are endless in terms of how filmmakers could explore the surreal dynamics of different dimensions thus allowing audiences to suspend their disbelief and engage in the wonderment of SF exuberance. So the question remains: can first-time director Dan Israelite instill some fresh distinction into the ubiquitous genre with the teen-oriented time travel vehicle ‘Project Almanac’? Well, let’s just say that superior spectacles such as ‘Looper’ and this year’s engaging ‘Predestination’ have nothing to worry about in terms of giving way to Israelite’s featherweight found footage fantasy. In fact, ‘Bill And Ted’s Excellent Adventure’ looks appetizing and inspired in comparison.  Relentlessly sketchy and as exhilarating as a PBS-televised high school science project during summer vacation, ‘Project Almanac’ fails to bounce sufficiently with its erratic presentation of cockeyed camerawork and crew of stock character whiz kids along for the surreal joyride.\r\n\r\nIsraelite and screenwriters Jason Harry Pagan and Andrew Deutschman concoct a breezy kiddie escapist flick where the scientific impishness feels somewhat upbeat and the young cast seem to be engaged in the time-traveling adventure that giddily plays out. However, whatever spry momentum that ‘Project Almanac’ manages to achieve is undermined by the distracting shaky hand-held camera movements and choppy jump cuts that turn this sci-fi caper into a disjointed B-movie bubble. Furthermore, the inclusive found footage material is overblown and exhausting. The gimmick, when used sparingly, was a treasured touch to heighten the anticipated tension. But ‘Project Almanac’ is not the only guilty party to spoil the essence of such a ‘trick of the trade’. The reality is that contemporary cinema–especially in horror and sci-fi–resort to these technical tactics to the point of no return.\r\n\r\nIt is no surprise that the arbitrary jittery cosmetics behind ‘Project Almanac’ is under the producing credit of Michael Bay whose reputation for exorbitant twitchy filmmaking has been documented in previous pulsating actioners.  Brilliant high school science mastermind David Raskin (Jonny Weston) has ambitions for attending prestigious MIT and needs the appropriate experimental project to be conducted in his attic for acceptance to his choice of prestigious schooling. The finances are tight and David is chasing after a scholarship that should ease the economic burden on his widowed mother (David’s scientific father had recently died).\r\n\r\nSo David is a chip off the old block like his late father. Daddy Dearest, however, did provide some incentive for his son to to realise his MIT dreams. David had discovered an unfinished experiment of his dad’s – a mysterious machine that has the capability of relocating individuals through time. This discovery is in the company of his ‘herd of nerd’ friends plus his younger sister Christina (Ginny Gardner) along to record the curious contraption that will eventually take them all on a back-and-forth odyssey where they can pop into time traveling moments that range from dealing with school bullies to being placed in front of chemistry class testing sheets.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, ‘Project Almanac’ never seizes the opportunity to think big in its time-traveling exploration. Instead, the movie mopes around with trivial tidbits such as petty scholarly set-ups and never really delves into grand confrontational entanglements that one would expect young impressionable brainiacs to face while awkwardly placing them in sensitive settings that all the book learning in the classroom cannot solve. The concept of this so-called time machine that David found in the basement by the skilled hands of his deceased old man should have predictably brought both father and son briefly together immediately in the name of their beloved interest in science, an irony nearly overlooked that could have been both poignant and profound. The nonsense of the kids cheating through invading the lottery result and retaking tests is a mere slap-on-the-hand cautionary tale that comes off somewhat corny and predictable.\r\n\r\nSadly,  ‘Project Almanac’ morphs into teen soap opera territory and sinks the minimal sci-fi flavoring it had for a nonsensical diversion punctuated by the aforementioned shoddy camera fluctuation and lack of time-traveling zest beyond small-time incidental dilemmas. Weston’s David Raskin had the potential to be the second coming of ‘Back To The Future’s Marty McFly but the lame plot and punchless exploits handcuffs him from answering the call.\r\n\r\nProject Almanac (2015)\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr.  46 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Jonny Weston, Allen Evangelista, Sam Lerner, Ginny Gardner and Sofia Black-D’Elia\r\n\r\nDirected by: Dean Israelite\r\n\r\nRated: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction/Teen Time Travel Adventurer/Sci-Fi and Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic’s rating: ** stars (out of four stars)"

I am sorry they never made a movie out of it, probably because it was more subtle with less action than other sci-fi stories for most of the book. But there are plenty of time travel movies out there, like this one.\r\n\r\nThe fact that teenagers are using the device to travel in time, plus the fact that - at first - they can't travel back more than a few weeks, obviously was put in place to limit their ability to travel whenever they want. So instead of trying to prevent a horrific world event, for instance, they are jumping back in time to tweak their own lives and mistakes. If you have watched many time travel movies, it isn't a spoiler for me to say things don't go exactly as planned.\r\n\r\nThere are a few clever plot twists here, and I mostly liked the chemistry between the lead characters. The dialogue became a bit wooden here and there, but overall the writing wasn't bad. I have to say my biggest gripe was with the hand-held camera routine. I almost wonder if they used it just to honor another movie with the word \"Project\" in the title, if you are wondering 'witch' movie I am referring to. But whatever the reason, it didn't really work for me.Their reasons for always lugging the camera around, even when there was just one character, fell flat for me. For the loss in camera work quality, there wasn't enough of a gain in plot or character interaction. But it didn't cause me to give up on it, just to wish it lived up to its potential. I am not going to comment on the ending and risk giving anything away, except to say that it felt a bit anti-climactic to me."

Unfortunately they start getting slain one by one, but who’s doing it and why? Will anyone survive to see the morrow?\r\n\r\n\"Scream Park\" is a micro-budget slasher that debuted for a special screening on Halloween, 2012, in Meadville, Pennsylvania, with a ‘world release’ in Pittsburgh on January 6, 2013. The singer of Skinny Puppy, Nivek Ogre (aka Kevin Graham Ogilvie), has a pretty significant role while Doug Bradley, who played Pinhead in nine “Hellraiser” films, has a minor part.\r\n\r\nIt was the debut work of writer/director Cary Hill who got his training from the University of Pennsylvania, which is where the Doug Bradley cameo was shot. The movie was otherwise filmed at the old Conneaut Lake Park in northwestern Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nDespite the low-budget vibe with some questionable sound here and there, the movie honors slasher traditions established in the early 80’s craze, starting with “Friday the 13th” (1980). The no-name actors do a fine job and the story pulled me in. The score and soundtrack are also decent.  \r\n\r\nWendy Wygant is likable as the main protagonist and Steve Rudzinski does well as the young, somewhat nerdy manager of the doomed park. Winsome petite blonde Alicia Marie Marcucci stands out as Allison on the feminine front and the director doesn’t fail to tastefully highlight her beauty. Nicole Beattie is also notable as the glum Goth chick, Missi. Another actress has a top nude scene, but I found her more scary than alluring, although I’m sure she’s a wonderful person and I give her credit for her chutzpah (just a heads up).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 24 minutes. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

I haven't watched much of her work, admittedly, but I loved her performances in the four 'Halloween' films I have seen her in, as well as 'The Fog', 'True Lies' and 'A Fish Called Wanda'. As she stated about the convention itself, the film--as a documentary of a moment in time, and of horror fans' love for her work--was top-notch, and the extra is well worth a watch, both for fans of Curtis' work and for those wanting to investigate the subculture of horror fans in general. It's a fun hour worth spending."

I don't know this director, but Mark Duplass was doing such kind of unique concept small films. So there's no surprise, except I did know I would end up liking it very much.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the film theme, kind of resembles 'Coherence'.

As their therapist's instruction a couple who are on the edge of losing their marriage, tries a weekend getaway to patch the differences. But end up encountering the strange events that pleases them more than what they've expected. When they begin to realise the reality, comes the trouble to fix it once for all.\r\n\r\nThe third act was amazing. The pace keeps getting better and the tension in the story simply creates enough curiosity about the ending. But the conclusion was very basic and guessable. I liked the honest than too much fancy. Still the viewers look for the answers regarding how it ended which is kind of a wide open for the discussions.\r\n\r\nI love modern sci-fi dramas, especially in the last one decade, I have been enjoying them a lot, which are highly intelligent yet casually narrated on the screen that anybody can understand easily. If you had liked films such as 'Coherence', 'Another Earth', 'Her', 'Melanchony' et cetera, then surely would have a good time with it.\r\n\r\n7/10"

        "content": "'The Voices' is a very dark comedy from graphic novelist Marjane Satrapi. It tells the story of a man named Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) who works in a bathtub factory. Jerry continuously sees a psychiatrist (Jacki Weaver) as he tries to live a normal life whilst dealing with his mental afflictions. He decides to pursue his office crush (Gemma Arterton) but soon finds himself in a murderous situation when she fails to reciprocate his advances. Jerry's schizophrenia means that he hears voices specifically from his pets who give him help and advice.\r\n\r\nSatrapi directs the piece with a surprisingly heartfelt and empathetic way. The lack of colour and light (such as when Jerry is on his limiting medication) contrast really well with the scenes where the main character is free and feels at peace. There are very graphic scenes of murder which highlight the brutality of his actions reminding the audience of the morality of Jerry's actions. The music is also very fitting and turns drastically into a horror-themed score when the drama switches.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is funny in a lot of places. Before I watched the film, I thought I would find similarities with HBO's 'Dexter' as it deals with a likeable killer whilst also being humorous. But, after watching, I feel that the film owes a lot to Mary Harron's 'American Psycho' as it shares similar themes of delusion and indulgence. However, the dialogue was a bit forced at times and I usually find myself cringing when watching a British actress (in this case Gemma Arterton) having to read lines written in a very stereotypical way.\r\n\r\nRyan Reynolds is fantastic as the main character and really makes the audience feel for his character. Reynolds completely embodies the main character's innocence and is a genuinely nice man. Even more impressive is the fact that Reynolds also performs voices for his pets which include a Scottish cat and a Texan dog. I had a slight problem with other members of the cast who I felt were not quite up to the standard that Reynolds set although Jacki Weaver was great as his psychiatrist and Anna Kendrick did a good job at playing his love interest.\r\n\r\nOverall, I feel that 'The Voices' was a surprisingly good film. It was funny and very well acted. 'The Voices' is a little hidden gem that a lot of people who are fans of small and strange indie comedies would love.\r\n\r\n★★★★"

A story like this I never thought would do fairly, a better movie from the average section. I think not without the Aubrey Plaza, she as a Beth was excellent. Not a career defining performance, but funny enough. The story looks only faintly different from other similar films, but a few good scenes saved it. If it had a couple more good jokes and maybe a twist, surely would have been done greatly at the box office.\r\n\r\nThere's no surprise material in it, I thinks that's negative about it. Easy to read the situation and predict the story within the first 15 minutes, but the second half was drastically changed its pace as well as the atmosphere in the story. If you've not seen many zombie films, especially comedy ones, then you may find it better than average.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a decent direction for a first timer, got a good support from the cast. For a small budget, this is a wonderful production quality. It surely upset you if you expect like 'Warm Bodies' or 'Shaun of the Dead', but if you know all about it before giving a try, the disappointment will be lessened and you may have a decent time pass with it.\r\n\r\n6/10"

Other than that I know nothing about his life, so I'm very thankful for this film. From the director of many sensational flicks comes this to inspire you. Wait, did I say inspire, but I'm little confused over how this film to be considered. Bobby Fischer was a great player, but he had some mental issues. So you can compare him to John Nash from 'A Beautiful Mind', except they're from different fields, but very intelligents.\r\n\r\nThis film was a little patriotic abut the American nation, especially defeating the Russians in the chess game. So I'm being neutral here. Bobby was the one to focus how he makes his life big with the game that requires a brain. The story began with short span of childhood and then soon skipped to adult Bobby Fischer competing in a biggest tournament in the world, a championship against the best. Nicely filmed with lots of exciting scenes, particularly Tobey Maguire as the main lead was brilliant. Liev Schreiber was another surprise with his frequent on and off role.\r\n\r\nGood film, but feels it is not complete, there should have more to it and like I said earlier, it has impacted, but not inspiring way which is why I'm doubting the screenplay.

Sadly, it failed at the box office, as well as to get recognised at the film festival circuits. Still, it got praised, looks not for the artistic work, but as the compensation. If you watch it, you will know there's something wrong, otherwise a film like this won't go unnoticed. I hope someone else makes another film about him in a grand way. Meanwhile, it is a good watch, but what do you expect from the Bobby Fischer like his game or personal issues will decide how much you liked it.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

        "content": "> A secret road adventure during the dark hours!\r\n\r\nSo the Jeff Nichols and Micahel Shannon saga continues. This is theirs 4th film together in the last nine years and all of them were well accepted. Now they are into sci-fi for this, which is kind of a road movie that resembles hundreds of other films. Only thematically, but in parts it looks different, especially for being too realistic as what the director is famous for. Finally, something is not a comedy or a full of CGI, yet still it is a wonderful sci-fi-drama with some thrill moments.\r\n\r\nIt opened like the midway of the story. We obviously have to wait for a proper explanation to know what's going on, who is the child and where they're taking him. So it all begins with two armed men driving a young kid on the dark hours. Only we know is that they are protecting the boy from the government people, but the film took some time to give a clear picture of the condition. In the meantime, I started my prediction game, but I expected the film to clarify how it all began. It never cared about that part, only moved forward and that's how we're going to get some answers where a few might feel its a let down.\r\n\r\nThe negative of the film is you won't fully understand it, but it is not an incomplete story, just designed that way that leaves for the viewer to add their own perspectives to where the writer left blank spaces. Like I said the people are comparing it with the similar films and I did not care about that, but I disappointed with the conclusion. It was neatly folded, I actually liked it, but it was not fresh, especially it totally mirrors 'Tomorrowland'. Now I know why Warner Bros moved it from last year to this year's release.\r\n\r\nIt might be a coincident because the director who is also the writer has a good reputation, so I believe it is definitely not a steal, just a common creative that we've already seen many films like that. Overall, this film is worth, but might not satisfy the Jeff Nichols fans, because like I said plenty of times before in my reviews, now it the sci-fi era and every filmmaker and film-star want to board on that plane. So it did not spare Jeff Nichols as well.\r\n\r\n7/10"

        "content": "Midnight Special is an entertaining Sci-fi flick that ultimately never reaches it's full potential. The father son on the run story is griping and well played with the talent of Michael Shannon who is believable as a father who will do anything to get his gifted son to where he needs to be. Dunst and Edgerton do some fairly solid work also as Altons mother and I believe step father. The dialogue is believable, the action and Sci-fi elements are all well put together. The concept almost ET like is interesting. The CGI is acceptable if not spectacular. The music well scored if not memorable. I personally found this movie felt long at 1h52mins and for some reason I felt the movie should of been set in an earlier time period like the 70s or 80's. These are small personal gripes and you may ask why it does not achieve it's full potential. The answer is simply the way it ends, it felt small or empty. These characters had done so much,  for this child and somehow the movie had left me with zero emotional connection to how the story played out. The father and son connection was the strongest element in the movie and this I felt needed a bigger part in the ending of this film, but for some reason they chose to pull back on this right at the buzzer. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Science fiction as a worthy watch. My final score 3.5 stars."

        "content": "> About how a terrible event changed the judicial system.\r\n\r\nThe name Angelina Jolie on the poster draw my interest on this one. She was executive producer of this excellent Amharic movie. I appreciate her side of contribution to lift the world cinema. Some of the stories go unheard, because they are happening in the remote places of the earth, far from the modern cities and countries. Newspapers, media might fail to report them in a long-range, because it is less interested in the other side of the world, but movies like this ensures the outreach.\r\n\r\nI think this is my first Ethiopian movie. All the cast and story take place in this landlocked East-African country. The narration often switches between a small village and the capital city. Based on the real and historical even about one of the oldest blind belief over marrying a girl when she and her family denied the permission. It's set in the year 1996, the story of a 14-year-old girl Hirut who'd successfully escaped from her abductor, but not without a blow en-route. Now she's facing a charge which she had done in self-defence and the rest is her fight in the court of law.\r\n\r\nAs usual, everything is fine in our society, so things won't change and it does not have to, until something terrible happens. As to what this film talks, the law was not written in a single day and some of them are overlaps with traditional culture which definitely need a serious reconsideration. It keeps changing until finding a correct solution. Take our society as an example, now the homosexual and marijuana laws were getting friendlier than ever. This story is another example of patching the loopholes in the law. It might come after a horrible incident, but makes sure that it won't repeat.\r\n\r\n> \"I can't even protect my little sister.\r\n> They will get her one day.\"\r\n\r\nThe entire film was not a courtroom drama, but people's bonding and cultural exposure. Actings were wonderful, especially the main two characters, Meaza and Hirut. The pace and focus was largely on the topic, but a few glimpses of landscapes of the countryside made me wonder how beautiful the Ethiopia is. I think the cinematography was at its best. This film has been officially submitted for the last concluded Oscars (2015), and in my view it should have been nominated for the main event instead of 'Timbuktu'.\r\n\r\nI thought it was a tale about some westerners who comes to help the little girl, or maybe adopt her, kind of stuffs. But it was purely a uni-national, uni-racial, its society and flawed judicial system which might give you a shock. After opening 30 minutes, I was pleased to have picked it to watch and ended highly satisfied when it ended. The conclusion was very emotional, especially the lines Hirut said was reflected what she went through and might going repeat for other girls.\r\n\r\nThis is highly recommended by me. This film needs viewers, to learn what's really happening out there. Especially in a male dominated society, how the children and women are coping to stand on their own feet. Because of the brave attempt by the brave women, the changes have come and building a better future for the next generation. So hats off to the director-cum-writer, producers and all the above those two ladies who are still carrying out their works to help the struggling women as the final report from film says. I think you won't regret watching it, so why don't give it a try.\r\n\r\n8½/10"

        "content": "This is very much my kind of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary” guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However, such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint. There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory” scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday."

Once the set-up has been staged - Wick grieves at the loss of his loved one - gets some small joy via a pet - only to have that snatched away from him, then the film becomes a joyously unstoppable actioner.\r\n\r\nWick, in good hands with a moody and beefy Reeves (face fuzz strange, though) strong in presence, cuts a swathe through the gangland eastern blockers. And that's pretty much it! Characterisations are thin on the ground, it's a bit nutty and of course preposterous, but boy is it fun. There you go, a box office winning actioner without pretensions.

It's also stylish, high energy, and generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here, but if you're squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we've heard this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat's different is the world in which this takes place. There's a secret criminal underground that seems to have their hands in everything, and there's a specific code and honor among thieves. Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn't involved or in the know somehow, so it's implied that this society is very widespread and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick is that he isn't a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo, he's not invincible. He's simply very well trained and determined, which makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know the outcome, there's always this little part in the back of your mind that wonders if he'll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic. Let's be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn't have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane's Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name is John; different spelling means it isn't a shortened version of his name) to Lance Reddick's hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there's a lot of ground to explore. It's not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies."

But to take this movie even further into brilliance, Stahelski prefers to show and not tell the audience about the world in which John Wick lives. As a result, everything is mysterious, leaving viewers intrigued, questioning, and wholly immersed in this assassin-filled world. The unusual gold coin currency, the legend and fear of John Wick, the enigmatic Continental hotel that forbids any assassin \"work\" on the premises, and much more sweeten a typical action revenge story into a cinematic treasure."

His performance does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics.

Well not for the really young of course due to the amount of action. Saying that this is a family movie is probably going to annoy a lot of people in the “bible belt” due to previously mentioned action as well as the fact that there is a bit of partying going on, including consumption of fermented and even distilled beverages on but hey, I am Swedish, when I was a kid, way too long ago, there was not a teenager around that had not tasted HB which is the Swedish term for “Hembränt” or in English home brewed alcohol.\r\n\r\nAnyway, unless you are a moral fanatic, there is really not much to be upset about in this movie apart from the laughably ludicrous story. Kids being trained as assassins from young age. Ehh, okay. Could have been half plausible if it was not for the “training” scenes in the beginning of the movie. Toddlers operating machine guns and driving cars like Vin Diesel? Okay, maybe they were just above toddler age but I was laughing so hard it was difficult to judge.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is pretty much without surprises (if you have read the blurb at least). Our heroin goes to school and, deprived of a normal childhood, finds it not so easy as she perhaps imagined. Here is where I feel there are a lot of missed opportunities. Our teenage assassin never really gets to truly impress. Sure, she gets to do a bit of clobbering but it is constantly hidden in a veil of ridicule. With a more intelligent script writer this could have been a really cool part but as it plays itself out it is just “okayishly” funny.\r\n\r\nNaturally a few bad guys arrive in order to crash the party and, well, we get a bit more of the same as before just with some more action. The action is not bad, for this kind of movie at least, that has to be said. Unfortunately the way it plays itself out is a wee bit disappointing. It is just unintelligent. The beginning of the movie seemed to hint that these teenagers were trained in all areas, including the grey cells, but certain scenes where just, “I cannot believe that you were that stupid”, and for the record I have a teenage son that made the same remarks!\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was indeed a quite entertaining movie.

While it didn't bring anything new, it was still a decent, enjoyable film. Some of the acting was good. Some was overtly cheesy. I always enjoy Samuel Jackson as a cranky mentor-type character. Ultimately, I didn't hate it and didn't love it."

He wrote it, as well handled everything and everyone carefully. In the name of comedy, he did not go lousy, like most of the B movies do. One of the best main roles ever it was for Lucy Punch in her entire career as far my observation and she outclassed it. Daman Wayans also having a good time recently with movies like 'Let's be Cops', 'Big Hero 6' and this. Certainly his career graph mounting like any actor dreamt for.\r\n\r\nVery similar storyline to the movie 'Let's Kill Ward's Wife', but instead 'kill', it replaced with the word 'marry'. Yep, Barry is the character in the movie who is very annoying, so his best buddies plan to set up with a woman to get rid of him. The title character Barry was the most important in the movie and it went to the right person to play. I know him barely, seen in a couple of films and again he was splendid with a casual performance. I am pretty much sure, the sequel is on the card. It will be a double trouble for Barry's buddies, but all my concern is the filmmakers don't want to mess it up like 'Horrible Bosses 2'.\r\n\r\n> BARRY is everywhere, in your life, mine and in this film.\r\n\r\nSo hilarious, even though, consider it is not a so popular flick. Worry is people will miss this enjoyable movie due to the unaware of its existence. That's the reason I review not-so-popular-good-movie on the regular basis. In my opinion, disappointment is not on the card. Believe me, the movie might not be a good as I am stating, but definitely not a bad one.

However, I didn't fully explore this piece, by Carl Orff, until I was eighteen years old. I've heard it countless times. I virtually memorized the lyrics (especially the Latin parts). Later, I saw it live. Much more recently, I became more in touch with the original texts and poetry of the Codex Buranus and with sung versions that are closer to the medieval sound, which was in line with my activity as a medievalist. And I have no doubt that I have not read or heard it all.\r\n\r\nWhen creating this symphonic work, at the beginning of the 20th century, Carl Orff selected some poems and gave them music. Although we often hear the various sections of his work separately (especially \"O Fortuna\", which turned out to be the most famous section), I feel that this is a work that needs to be heard in its entirety to become understandable in its message. There is a coherent logic in the choice of poems, and in the order in which Orff places the various sections, transforming this work into an ode to human nature, the cycle of life and the hopes and anxiousnesses of Man. It is no coincidence that it begins and ends with \"O Fortuna\", the song that best describes the ups and downs of luck and chance in our lives.\r\n\r\nJean-Pierre Ponnelle took an excellent initiative when directing this recording, where nothing is done in a thoughtless way either. Orff himself, when visiting the film set, was impressed and satisfied with the entire production, which indicates that we can see, in this footage, something that will closely resemble what the composer imagined in his mind. I especially liked the inclusion of the various allegorical figures (the Angel, the Devil, Justice, Faith, Temperance, Time etc.) because I feel they fit well into the big picture, along with the various allusions to medieval art, to cathedrals, to medieval environments and scenarios. The various popular and noble costumes also deserve praise. An excellent staging work.\r\n\r\nThe recording has excellent actors, starting with the various soloists. John Van Kesteren is a tenor that Orff respected a lot, and it's great to hear him here. Lucia Popp also deserves a round of applause. At this stage of her career, she was becoming one of the most beautiful and solid coloratura sopranos of her time, and she offers us here an excellent vocal work and a great resourcefulness on stage. I don't know Hermann Prey that well, he stopped singing long before I remembered to pay attention to him, but I like what I hear on the various existing recordings, and this one is no exception. Also, he really knew how to fill the screen and steal our attention. Invisible to the eye, but omnipresent, the Munich Radio Orchestra does an excellent job."

Danny Trejo was not bad but Danny Glover never really felt like a bad ass and his fart jokes was definitely more bad taste than bad ass.\r\n\r\nThe story was fairly whimsical and unintelligent. Some things were just poorly done. Like for instance Frank blowing up a chopper by throwing a hand grenade at it from a car. It was so poorly done that I just sat there thinking what the f…? And then on the end where they kill (of course) the main bad guy and Bernie claims that there he got his liver and that they should put the guy on ice. It actually looks like whoever wrote that crap actually believed in it as well since the final scenes implies that Bernie got his liver transplant. What kind of an idiot writes something like that. Heard about transplant compatibility requirements? Oh, and that nonsense with the ice-pick. If you get an icepick showed all the way into your head through your eye you most likely die. You do not walk around the next day with nothing but an eye patch.\r\n\r\nThen we have this diplomatic immunity crap. It really doesn’t work that simple. You might get away with a few speeding tickets but you cannot go on a crime spree and expect not to be expelled at least. That stuff might have been okay in Lethal Weapon but now it is really just dumb.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I have to say that I was rather disappointed with this movie. The first one was better and that one was enjoyable but not great to begin with. There are some fun moments, some decent fighting and so on so it is not a total turkey but disappointing nonetheless."

Humphrey really shows he's a great coach and a loving dad, the puppies are cuter than ever, Marcel and Paddy are still hilarious and the new puppy Fleet, he was also great. and we also get Kate too. now, i was a little bit sad that there wasn't a lotta Kate moments in the movie. she's only in the movie for like the last half. but like always, Kate steals the show! the moments with her in the movie gotta be some of the best moments i seen in any movie so far. Kate never fails to bring a big smile on your face. she's still hot and sexy without a doubt (hey, she'll always be like that), but she also proves that she's a fantastic mom. the first time we see Kate in the movie (spoiler alert! again stop reading if you haven't seen it yet) is in a flashback Claudette has where she's teaching her the slide. this scene was just so adorable, i never stop smiling. and it's proof that Kate's the best character in this awesome saga and she'll always be. the bummer of this movie, it's that the story wasn't that strong. it's like Tom Kane was like \"Sorry, i can't think of a better story now, so here ya go: The Great Wolf Games\" what? Tom Kane, you can do better. i know you can. also half of the main characters aren't in this movie. i totally get the fact that Kate came earlier from the hunting trip, but i would've loved to seen them at the end. that never happened in this movie, so yea it was kinda of a let down.\r\nall that aside, Alpha and Omega 3 is still a awesome movie and i love it."

As it is, it's an OK depiction of the struggles of the man against the elements, technology, human frailty and government to get his ideas implemented. Hayden is a charm-free actor here, his dedication to his task is laudable, but cheerless and any semblance of romance with wife Sue (a rather prim Alexis Smith) left me cold. It does have oodles of wonderful original aerial photography to augment it, though - and that helps. Sadly, though, this is all as flat as the deck on the \"USS Princeton\"."

This time it takes us to the London. But the film reminded me the 80s film 'Poltergeist', particularly the second part. So don't assume it is exactly the same, only the scenes involving house seems similar, but the story was different. It is another true story based film, that's what they said in the opening statement. You're not forced to believe that, if you're here for an entertainment, you will get that if you put your logics away for the two hours.\r\n\r\nA family of four young children and their mother living in a house in the London witness some serious paranormal activities lately. Particularly the eleven year old girl affected the most with the spirit the house possessed. So the American couple from the first film are brought in to do their best to help the family. When they try to contact the spirit, they won't get what they were looking for. Instead, an unexpected blame goes for the girl and soon the family loses confidence in them. The overcoming those misunderstanding, particularly realising the truth brings a twist before concluding the tale.\r\n\r\nThe one twenty minute never looked too long. Because there's always something keeps happening, so the audience to keep engaged with. Probably this is won't be your best horror film of the years, but being a horror themed film, it had good form of those contents. Not too scary, at a time those clichés were used in a good way to bring freshness in the scenes. I will credit the writers for that. Besides, the actors were undoubtedly good, including those little ones. For me this is a better horror film and I definitely look for another sequel.

While this is touched on briefly, it's done more in the context of people who don't believe them are all mean and unsympathetic.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's a competently made horror film that's better than its predecessor, if a little predictable, but don't look at it as being based on a true story.

For a decade, the little kids grew into older teenagers. But for an animation character, there's no concept of ageing. They always remain same. This film just gave a new perspective. I mean it talked about being or growing old and how it impacts our lives. That we can't hold forever our safe position. Sooner or later, the youngsters will take over it.\r\n\r\nMcQueen is enjoying his racing, competing with his friendly opponents. But it all changes when a young rookie rewrites the history.

The whole production builds up around Lightning McQueen, rightly, before strangely having a conclusion that focuses on newbie Cruz Ramirez. I like the idea of what they were going for, but the way the do it is actually quite poor - it feels too forced, as well as chucking most of the development for McQueen across acts one and two out the window.\r\n\r\nWith that said, it isn't a massive hindrance. I still had a fun time with this. Owen Wilson remains good as McQueen, while Cristela Alonzo gives an accomplished performance as Ramirez. One thing I do rate about Alonzo is that Disney didn't go down the obvious, lovey-dovey route with her. \r\n\r\nNone of the rest of the cast standout all that much, though it's cool to hear Kerry Washington as Natalie Certain. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) is arguably underused, which is weird as he is overused in the 2011 sequel - they don't seem to know how to fit him in ideally.\r\n\r\nThe overall premise itself is interesting, while the animation remains in top gear. The ending doesn't fit perfectly for me, but I can still recommend that you give this a viewing."

        "content": "**The end of a franchise that was never really worth our interest.**\r\n\r\nI never really wanted to see the “Cars” movies. As I said before, I was already an adult when they appeared, and I particularly felt the almost invasive force of the propaganda machine that, by all means, tried to foist the film on us, almost in the same way that Jehovah's Witnesses go to people's homes to sell their perspective of religion. “Cars” was everywhere, and the merchandising involved was a billion-dollar business in itself. Therefore, I preferred not to see them. I don't like to feel that things are being forced on me. I saw this film, the last of the trilogy, right now.\r\n\r\nComparing this film to the first in the franchise could be considered an honest effort. The two films are quite similar, although the first has an ascendant, due to its novelty. As for the script and the story itself, both are complete clichés: if one talks about the success of a novice “outsider”, full of nobility and desire to win, the third film already shows us that everything has an end, and that there is to know how to leave the scene and give way to others in an honorable and dignified way. It is the eternal question of the passage of generations and their conflicts. In the middle of these two films, “Cars 2” is completely out of place, just having a character as the protagonist who only appeared a few minutes in the first film. “Cars 3”, as cliché as it may be, rediscovered some of the merits and values of the first film.\r\n\r\nEven so, and despite the commercial and critical success, I don't think it's honest to compare any film in the “Cars” franchise with the films “Toy Story”, “Up” or “Inside Out”. In these films, Pixar bet on creativity, that is, on the creation of an original story and very original characters. That never happened in \"Cars\". Just think of the huge amount of cartoons that include, albeit in an accessory way, talking cars. It's an old idea, one that Pixar has merely retreaded and brightened up, with CGI animation techniques it masters like few others. Quite simply, it was a way to earn lots of money with little effort.\r\n\r\nIn this film, we once again have the technical brilliance, attention to visual detail and the sharpness and quality of digital animation that Pixar has accustomed us to. It would be too bad for the studio not to be able to honor its credits and fail even at this! In addition to the magnificent animations, the mixing, sound and editing work was really taken very seriously and done by good professionals. The work of the voice actors also deserves no notice, with the return of Owen Wilson and other outstanding voices, joined by Cristela Alonso. All were well, in an impeccable work.\r\n\r\nIf we have already spoken about the script, we can only talk about the comic: the film makes several attempts at humor, and if the jokes seem to be well-placed in the plot, the truth is that they have almost no strength or impact, and simply do not make people laugh. They're not funny. Attempts to thrill or move the audience also failed utterly, largely due to the Franciscan poverty of the characters, merely sketchy and barely able to capture our sympathy."

I simply loved that one, just for the entertainment's sake. I anticipated, 'Project XX' or 'Project Y', followed by 'XXX' or 'Z', but that never happened. I thought the director was setting up his own style of filmmaking, but this film did not clinch well. There's no story, just based on one evening event that stretches as far as another day by adding brief oral flashbacks to match with the rest of the storyline. But the fact is it was a comedy version of 'Hitman'.\r\n\r\nThe red band trailer I saw revealed many stuffs, but the movie still offered lots of variety from the different angles of the same stuffs. Jesse Eisenberg, I never expected him to play a character like this, he was good. But it was only a partial display, if there is a sequel, I expect that would be an uncompromised when it comes to the stunts and heroic adventure. Although I enjoyed the end credit animation.\r\n\r\nKristen Stewart was just hanging around, though her character had potential to be a game changer, so let's hope the sequel strengthens that part. Yeah, I'm kind of certain about the follow-up after seeing this film's ending, if they don't consider to make one, that would be theirs great loss. Anyway, the movie is a good entertainer, but not your unusual story as you expect it to be.\r\n\r\n6/10"

It stars Sylvia Syms, Herbert Lom, Ronald Howard, Melvyn Hayes and Stanley Holloway. Music is by Laurie Johnson and cinematography by Gilbert Taylor.\r\n\r\nCapturing a young tearaway, a London copper tells the youngster a story from a couple of decades earlier. It's about a family living in the slums of the East End, of a pretty daughter getting involved with the local racketeer, of the young impressionable son turning to crime, it's of their fates, trials and tribulations.\r\n\r\nPart kitchen sink plotter, part noir melodrama, No Trees in the Street is thin on story but big on heart. Ted Willis is guilty of not fully pushing the drama through in his adaptation, getting caught between making a potent anti-crime piece and that of a mawkish \"we had it tough back then\" nostalgia trip.\r\n\r\nThat said, the tale does hold tight throughout, and all the characters are nicely drawn and placed within a depressingly real backdrop. The means, motives and decisions involving some of them are cutting, keeping the narrative edgy, while the cast performances are bang on the money for such a screenplay. Bonus comes with Taylor's (Ice Cold in Alex/Repulsion) photography, which come the second half of film dresses it all up in noir nirvana. 6/10"

        "content": "It seems Chimbudevan just cannot make a film without an element of fantasy. Oru Kanniyum Moonu Kalavanikalam ( OKMK), like last year's Naveena Saraswathi Sabatham, opens not on Earth but in the celestial abode of the gods. We see Bramha sitting atop a giant lotus and Naradar meeting him just in the nick of time before he goes to sleep. This talk about time makes them approach Shiva, who, to show them how every minute is important (every day has many fates in it, is how he puts it), chooses one random person in the real world to prove his theory. \r\n\r\nThat person happens to be Tamizh ( Arulnithi), a cash-strapped young man, who we see plotting a kidnap with his friends Malar ( Bindu Madhavi) and Ramanujam Esakki ( Bagavathi Perumal). They have been promised Rs 30 lakh by Hippie Lahiri (Nasser), a bling-sporting Malaysian businessman, to kidnap Isha (Ashrita), the daughter of his rival. And, oh, incidentally, Isha also happens to be Tamizh's girlfriend and so, for Tamizh, this is \"Ore kallula oru manga oru thenga\"! \r\n\r\nThe first hour of OKMK is a terrific, nail-biting black comedy cum thriller. We get a gun-toting, Siruvar Malar-reading cop, a chase that intercuts with a romantic backstory, a gun that is in orange, pink and yellow, and superb turns from a dozen recognizable character actors, atmospheric cinematography (by SR Kathir), sharp lines (\"Kovakkara yezhai dhaan thirudan\") and what seems to be an interesting development — Tamizh is shot at and we are genuinely shocked; a hero dying midway through the film? \r\n\r\nAnd, then, the director cuts back to the gods and we realize his true intentions. The film instantly turns into a what-if movie — what if Tamizh had started a minute late or another minute later? The director, to his credit, acknowledges Tom Tyker's Run Lola Run, in the end credits. But, suddenly, the fizz goes away from the film as we are shown reiterations of the same set of circumstances playing out differently. And, for a film that is all about the value of time, the director takes a rather longer time to tell this story; there is even a stab at melodrama (thankfully, it is only half-hearted). \r\n\r\nTo be fair, Chimbudevan at least manages to make these scenes interesting, with his humourous lines and inventive writing (even the interval point arrives when there is an interval on screen) but we realize we have nothing more to expect from the film other than the amusement of seeing the same scenes taking place differently. But the one what-if that the directors fails to explore is much more fascinating — what if Tamizh had managed to somehow kidnap Isha, despite being wounded? We cannot escape the feeling that Chimbudevan got stuck at this point while writing and decided to take the easy way out by turning this into a genre that he is familiar with — fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe lead trio are competent and do make us root for them, but it is supporting actors like Nasser, Delhi Ganesh, Mano Bala, Aadukalam Naren, Jayaprakash and VS Raghavan (who gets the cheekiest line in the film after uniting Tamizh with Isha: \"Naama serthu vekkalaina, marupadiyum modhalla irundhu varuvaanga\", taking a dig at the script's construct) who are the real stars here. They are all just so perfect in their parts and create a memorable impression despite the miniscule screen time and that is certainly Chimbudevan's triumph."

However, I have just seen it on TV, on a Sunday morning, the regular time at which children's animated films are usually shown. And after researching a little about it, I was truly surprised by the number of films about roosters and eggs that Mexican animation cinema has already made.\r\n\r\nOverall, I liked what I saw. It's not an original film, we've already seen a lot of similar things, but it was a consistent, solid effort and denotes some ambition and also technical and artistic capacity, which is commendable for a country that makes a lot of cinema for regional consumption, but has some difficulty in export films to the Old Continent. It's not a movie that makes me laugh a lot, and I bet most kids will enjoy it, but without feeling excited about what they're seeing and quickly forgetting everything they've seen.\r\n\r\nThe script revolves around Toto, a young chicken who has to save his family's farm, preventing it from being taken over by a malicious landowner. To do so, he needs to defeat a big fighting cock in a stakes fight. Of course, the other animals, chickens and talking eggs will try their best to help you tip the odds in your favour. Therefore, it is a retelling of the old story of David against Goliath, of the struggle of the oppressed and weak against the powerful. It's effective, has a good, uplifting moral message, and entertains the audience well.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film deserves attention for its impeccable graphics and visuals. The CGI used in the animations is not exactly state of the art, it is not pristine and ultra-realistic. None of that. However, it's elegant enough, pretty enough, doesn't make gross mistakes, and has very good color and stroke. The mood isn't perfect, but it seems okay, it's within what I expected to find. I cannot evaluate the original dialogues and jokes since I saw the dubbed version for my language and not the original, but I am satisfied with the dub done by the Portuguese, it is a job that seems to be well done."

        "content": "As likened to an innocuous fairy tale rash, the movie mythology surrounding J.M. Barrie’s classical kiddie character “Peter Pan” comes and goes when it pleases. Naturally there have been several big screen interpretations to outlast one’s reserved stash of pixie dust to fling around. From perhaps the best known animated film adaptation of Walt Disney’s nostalgically revered version to the surprisingly big-budgeted Steven Spielberg-directed spectacle dud Hook with a high-caliber cast the legend of “The Boy That Never Grew Up” seems to spark the challenge of presenting yet another spin on Barrie’s iconic treasured tyke.\r\n\r\nIn director Joe Wright’s sci-fi fantasy action-adventure Pan the familiar factors of Barrie’s magical Boy Wonder are evident and should serve as a mild and manufactured revisit to the “Peter Pan” folklore for children of all ages. However, the whimsical aspect of Pan was dubiously overshadowed, overproduced yet curiously understated in its ability to convey a storytelling moment that did not seem laborious. Consequently, Pan feels mechanical and never quite settles in with any sense of breezy charm or youthful balance of wonderment. Instead, the audience is left wondering about the uniqueness and distinctive approach to an already ubiquitous serving of Barrie’s celebrated literary lad. Despite the vibrant visuals and the given big screen blueprint for “Peter Pan’s” endearing legacy Wright’s toothless tale of flashy action and adventure may just prove to be another proverbial flash in the Pan. \r\n\r\nClearly, there is no rhyme or rhythm to tamper with the built-in concept of what the majestic make-up for “Peter Pan” should be conceived in the minds of generations that were subjected to Barrie’s boundless boy. Still, Wright and Jason Fuchs fail to capture any fresh imagination or intrigue about the puppy dog-eyed youngster’s on-screen by-the-dots adventures. This pumped-up project is pedestrian at best and nothing more than another sparkled rung in the “Peter Pan” ladder of box office hits-and-misses. The casting for Pan is decent enough but the shoddy material they are left to elevate with their included presence is wasted in a stillborn fantasy odyssey that cannot overcome its own creative indifference.\r\n\r\nPan seeks to start out with its own embedded twist by delivering this narrative as a prequel set in 1940’s London. Here, we are introduced to 12-year old Peter (Levi Miller) whose disillusionment continues to spiral while staying at the chaotic Catholic orphanage he was unceremoniously dumped off courtesy of his desperate mother (Amanda Seyfried). Nevertheless, Peter maintains some semblance of hope that his mother will soon return to fetch him and all should solve whatever abandonment issues he has at hand.\r\n\r\nSoon, Peter and his fellow orphanage buddies will succumb to the clutches of Blackbeard the Pirate (Hugh Jackman). Evidently bad boy Blackbeard had been a notorious busy beaver by sadistically kidnapping working class children and shipping them off to his Neverland mines to toil there. However, Blackbeard and his bunch cannot be too bad to tolerate since they welcome out-of-the-blue snappy sing-a-longs to such noteworthy tunes as Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and the Romones’ “Biltzkrieg Bop”. Huh? Of course this impromptu musical sequence is not the only thing that seems curiously out of place in the disjointed Pan. \r\n\r\nOkay...so Hugh Jackman has both a black beard and a black heart in PAN. How about a blackboard to erase this ill-conceived ode to the J.M. Barrie treasured tyke?\r\nOkay…so Hugh Jackman has both a black beard and a black heart in PAN. How about a blackboard to erase this ill-conceived ode to the J.M. Barrie treasured tyke?\r\nIt is not long before the plagued Peter meets and becomes attached to a hustling drifter named James Hook (Garrett Hedlund). Yes folks…it appears that Star Wars comparisons are in order here as Peter’s Luke Skywalker teams with shifty Hook’s Han Solo to defeat the devilish Blackbeard’s Darth Vader. And you might want to ask who is the Princess Leia in this disguised Star Wars premise amid the mines and high seas? Well, in this case Princess Leia is in the form of Pan’s Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara). Thus, the gang assembles together in an attempt to thwart the iron fist of Darth Vader…er, the diabolical Blackbeard. The excitable exploits of the crew coming together to defeat the pesky pirate is meshed together with the flashy flourishes of random 3-D special effects, the vitality of color and scope and playful variations of well-known “Peter Pan” personalities. Hence, all the festive and feisty flexing that Pan demonstrates still cannot compensate for a lackluster execution of Wright’s anemic installment that botches a ready-made backstory for “Peter Pan” enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nAs Peter, Miller shows some solid and impish promise as the boy searching for self-discovery in a bizarre surrounding of despair and disappointment. Jackman’s over-the-top villainous Blackbeard is simply passable but nothing really worth hanging your hat on. Jackman’s plotting pirate will not make anyone dismiss Johnny Depp’s Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies anytime soon. The added elements in supporting players such as Hedlund’s Hook and Mara’s Tiger Lily (not to mention the Lost Boys) feel synthetic and arbitrary–something not very encouraging as these characterizations are essential to the whole “Peter Pan” universe.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Pan one might end up saying never mind to the boisterous yet aimless shenanigans situated in Neverland.\r\n\r\nPan (2015)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.\r\n\r\n1 hr. 51 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Levi Miller, Hugh Jackman, Garrett Hedlund, Rooney Mara, Amanda Seyfried\r\n\r\nDirected by: Joe Wright\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG\r\n\r\nGenre: Sci-Fi Fantasy and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic’s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

There are plenty of unofficial prequels and sequels were also made and met success. Yet this prequel with high budget and modern technology, but not a Disney film, generated some expectations with stars like Hugh Jackman and Rooney Mara in it.\r\n\r\nThe box office was not as expected, and the movie was also just above average, but I liked the performances and visuals. The story is about an orphan Peter who becomes a Pan, a leader to 'the lost boys'. The opening line goes like this: 'Sometimes friends begin as enemies and enemies as friends' and that's what the rest of the movie evolves.\r\n\r\nI don't think I liked this story. In all the prequels, I loved the Nick Willing's 'Neverland' who is a master of prequels to all the greatest fairytales. I disappointed with this only because of lack of the depth in narration, short storyline and quick scenes, other than that it was not a bad flick to me. The main relief was, it was not like the recent 'Alice in Wonderland' style movie with the weird costumes, makeups and the character physiques.\r\n\r\nDespite all the negative feedback for this flick, I feel it won't hurt for a one time watch. My eye is now on its sequel, because before the Wendy's introduction there's another story is to be told and that is between Peter and Hook. But now it's on doubt over the result of this movie.

Blackbeard is a rather nasty villain and there are certainly more danger for the good guys in this movie.

Also, unlike what some reviewers state Peter Pan does fly in the movie. I can only assume that those who state that he does not never bothered to see the movie to the end. Do not review a movie if you cannot be bothered to finish it for Christ sake!\r\n\r\nThe movie leaves a bit of a whole between the end of this story and the beginning of the traditional Peter Pan story.

Both films start with an aging man travelling back from Taiwan to China to meet the woman he deserted in the late 1940s when the Nationalists fled to Taiwan. But whereas in Wang's movie they meet and chew over the past, in Emily LIU 劉怡明's the search is taken up by the daughter when the man suddenly dies of a heart attack. As the daughter pairs with a young Mainlander as her guide, her father's history becomes a problem inherited by the younger generation — one a young woman who was born in Taiwan and has never had any interest in visiting the Mainland, the other a young Mainlander who sees her as some kind of strange alien. As the woman discovers her family roots, the only big question in whether she'll be able to swap the life she knows in Taiwan for a new one in her \"native land\". \r\n\r\nTo the film's credit, these undercurrents don't get in the way of the entertainment. Great Wall My Love can be enjoyed simply as a road movie-cum-odd couple romance, with two highly engaging performances from its leads (China's TONG Dawei 佟大為 and Taiwan-born Cherrie YING 應采兒) and bright, positive photography by ace Taiwan d.p.

But it's Ying, whose career started promisingly in Hong Kong (Visible Secret II 幽靈人間Ⅱ　鬼味人間 (2002), Throw Down 柔道龍虎榜 (2004)) a decade ago but lost traction during the mid-noughties, who dominates the movie in perhaps the best performance of her career. Animated and sexy, and a natural comedienne, Ying makes the role of the mercurial Chun-chun far fresher and more substantial than it seems on paper — and likable rather than annoying. Her chemistry with Tong is what drives the movie and prevents it from becoming just a glorified travelogue.\r\n\r\nThere's not a mention of politics in the entire film. Instead, Great Wall is more about trust: on the surface, Chun-chun's trust in men in general, though by extension Taiwanese trust in mainland China. To the credit of director Liu and star Ying the tone is kept light while still managing emotional undertow, and even the supporting performances are deftly drawn in limited screen time (Kelly KO 柯素雲's mother, DONG Xuan 董璇's jealous work colleague). A champion of then-unfashionable mainstream film-making (Kangaroo Man  袋鼠男人 (1994)) at a time when Taiwan cinema was trapped in an arty, festival ghetto of its own making, Liu, based in Beijing for several years, shows no signs of her 10-year lay-off since her last movie, Woman Soup 女湯 (1999). At a technical level it's very smooth, and slides along effortlessly, even when not much is happening apart from the characters riffing off each other in beautiful locations.\r\n\r\nLess use of manga-like animated inserts (which mark the film as rather chick-flicky Taiwanese), and B&W flashbacks to the father's Mainland youth, would have been better — and allowed the film to work itself out just in contemporary terms between the two leads. But at the end of the day Great Wall still packs an emotional clout thanks to its simple, unaffected charm and quiet humour. The Chinese title means Chasing Love."

        "content": "> Try everything (but differently). So Disney has done it again.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.\r\n\r\nOkay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.\r\n\r\nSo the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.\r\n\r\nThese days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.\r\n\r\nThe Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it. And finally a request for the Disney, bring it on a sequel as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n8/10"

Seriously? Anyway, she puts on the hard work and makes it to the land where anything is possible.\r\n\r\nZootopia makes some good real life comparisons: Zootopia itself seems to look like New York, even including a hustle by a sly fox.  Racism seems to be ever present in both color and speech. But the best thing about Zootopia is Judy’s positive attitude and relentless determination to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe animation is as good as a Pixar animation – perfectly made  – and the story is well told, full of action scenes and funny moments. Kids will definitely love this one and grown up kids will enjoy the deep thought provoking tones set in this movie. \r\n\r\nThe best performance in this movie arguably comes from Police Chief Bogo whose voice is played by Idris Elba. His performance should earn him an Oscar this year! No wonder it has grossed 1 Billion dollars worldwide despite little marketing. \r\n\r\nRated 9 out of 10 only because we cannot give it a 10."

It is a perfect blend of funny characters, decent story and little jokes spread around in the animation.\r\n\r\nAlmost all characters are very likable and funny, each in a different way. The actual story has quite a bit of suspense (for an animated family film) while still being sufficiently light and funny. Actually it is kind of two stories. One is the story of Judy Hopps fighting to prove herself as a police officer and the other is the more sinister evil plot that she attempts to unravel.\r\n\r\nThe movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. The two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.\r\n\r\nThe animation itself was certainly adequate although I sometimes miss the old hand drawn animations from Walt Disney.\r\n\r\nOverall, one of the better, if not the best, animated movie I have watched in quite a while."

        "content": "Why I find Zootopia revolutionary\r\n==============================\r\n\r\n1. The creative design of the titular city, and the astonishing world building.\r\n\r\n2. Using colors and deliberately simple animation not just to make the movie appeal to children, but also to indicate the so-called ideal city of Zootopia where every animal is pure and innocent.\r\n\r\n3. Blending more than one genre into a single animated film while keeping the plot spotless and not messy.\r\n\r\n4. Delivering many contemporary messages and tackling some quite touchy timely themes that have never been explored in an animated film before. And by giving the priority to the center message, that of prejudice, nothing felt muddled and all over the place, since no message overshadowed the other.\r\n\r\n5. Using the on-the-surface message (achieve one's ambition) as a characteristic of the main character (Judy Hopps), not as the actual main message. That makes this message works as a motive not as a major theme in the movie as in, for instance, Wreck-It Ralph (I LOVE it, though ♥).\r\n\r\n6. Avoiding being over-sentimental, although Nick's character could have been easily used to manipulate our feelings.\r\n\r\nThis movie is an absolute masterpiece. Not only because its wonderful way that gives its many messages in, but also because the importance of its messages in themselves, and how smart and relevant they are. Today, children really need to be taught these morals.\r\n\r\nThe talented cast's voices fit their characters perfectly. It has a plenty of funny scenes littered with extremely hilarious jokes which we haven't heard before in any animated movie, or even in a live-action movie. This movie blends so many genres: Comedy, Adventure, Action, Crime, and Mystery. That said, you will never feel confused while watching it.\r\n\r\nThe characters are definitely some of the most complicated characters I've ever seen in an animated movie. Each character has its own point of view due to the experiences they had, and thus makes each character has different motives and feelings.\r\n\r\n(10/10)"

Ginnifer Goodwin (Judy) leads the cast very well, while Jason Bateman gives the most memorable performance as Nick. Idris Elba and Jenny Slate (not Edie Falco or Constance Shulman, as I initially guessed... just me? Probably) are good too.\r\n\r\nThe premise is actually my favourite part of this film. I'm not saying it's anything revolutionary, but it actually feels fresh throughout - I enjoyed seeing it play out, it's paced perfectly. There's a nice <em>'Breaking Bad'</em> reference in there, too.\r\n\r\nAn entertaining 2016 animated film, one that also has a positive message. Recommended."

        "content": "In a poignant scene in Jigarthanda, an elderly man tells Karthik, a young guy who is on the verge of directing his first film, about the attitude of debutant filmmakers. They will demand everything and not compromise, the old man says and goes on to narrate how he, when he was all set to direct a film after a decade of toil in the industry, refused to accept the request of his producer to cast two of his relatives and walked out of the project saying he will get a thousand other producers for his story. \"Aana, kadaisi varikkum aayirathula oruthan kooda varala,\" he says to make Karthik understand that he has to grab the opportunity that is knocking on his doors, despite the conditions it brings along with it. \r\n\r\nGiven that Jigarthanda was the first script that Karthik Subbaraj had written before he 'compromised' and made Pizza (the applause that his name generates during the title credits show how influential this young director has become), he should know how a good filmmaker can exploit a compromise. And, that is essentially what the film is all about — a filmmaker forced to make the worst possible compromise turning it into the best possible chance. \r\n\r\nThe film begins with an award-winning director ( Nasser, in a cameo) and a producer ( Naren) fighting over the merits of Karthik's ( Siddharth) short film on the sets of a reality show. The director dubs it \"kuppa padam\" and the producer, who clearly has personal issues to settle with him, calls it the best he has seen on the show and announces that he will produce Karthik's first film. But when the young man approaches him, he tells him that he wants not a message movie but a bloody gangster movie. He lists Hollywood films in the genre (The Godfather, Scarface, \"Tarantino\") and tells Karthik, \"Idhu madhiri oru script ready pannu,\" and without pausing adds, \"Illa idhaye script-a pannalum OK\". \r\n\r\nBut like any self-respecting first-time filmmaker, Karthik has too much integrity and so decides that he will make a gangster film based on a true gangster. He gets to know about Assault Sethu (Simhaa), a fearsome gangster who calls the shot in Madurai, and decides to go to the temple town to research about Sethu and come up with an authentic gangster movie. He entices his Madurai-based friend Oorani ( Karuna, who carries forward his Yaamirukka Bayamey form) to help him in the task but the duo is hardly able to make progress. But Sethu enters his life in the least expected way leading to situations that could put both his filmi career and life in danger. \r\n\r\nIf Pizza was a con movie dressed up as a haunted house horror thriller, Jigarthanda is basically a comedy cloaked as a gangster movie. In the first half, the director provides us the gangster thriller that the trailers promised us — a villain who is both awesome and frightening, his quirky underlings (one of them is a teetotaler and a god-fearing man whose weakness is porn and the scenes where Karthik and Oorani try to woo him by supplying him porn are a blast), brutal murders, and a tense interval block. There is even some virtuoso camerawork by the cinematographer Gavemic Ary, and a lengthy shot in the scene where an attempt is made by a rival to murder Sethu is remarkable. The heroine, too, is an interesting character and isn't there just for the romantic track. She and her mom, an idli seller who cooks for Sethu, are Sourashtrians (this is the second film in recent times to show the heroine as a Sourashtrian, after Naan Than Bala), and they are part of a group that steals saris from cloth stores! \r\n\r\nThe tone gradually shifts in the second half and unlike Pizza, where a single reveal altered our view of the film, here, we never realize that we are seeing a film different from the one we had seen in the first half. The mood lightens considerably over the scenes and we never find this shift in genres jarring when the mood turns somewhat serious again towards the end. The intensity drops in the second half, which does have shades of the Malayalam film Udayananu Tharam (which was influenced by the Steve Martin-Eddie Murphy-starrer Bowfinger) but this is certainly not an 'inspired' film. Also, Sethu's transformation in the end seems a little predictable (and also sentimental), but the actors, especially Simhaa, who owns this role and is terrific in the climax, make us forget this niggle to a large extent. \r\n\r\nKarthik Subbaraj has called the film a musical gangster film and the soundtrack is definitely eclectic and involves a melange of genres. Santhosh Narayanan uses everything from funky Tamil folk to pieces that recall Ennio Morricone's scores for spaghetti westerns in the background. Then, there are also film songs that are used as montages. The film opens to the strains of Paasa Malar's Malarnthu Malaratha (we see it first playing in a theatre where a shootout happens but in what is a frequently employed style in the film, the song spills over into the next scene where it plays as the hero's ringtone), but there is also the mandatory Ilaiyaraaja song (here, it is Kadhalin Deepam Ondru) and even something as recent as Pesuren Peuren from Pannaiyarum Padminiyum. And, if the heroine tells a 'kavidhai' involving rain and Ilaiyaraaja, in a scene that wants to inform that the 80s was not just restricted to the maestro, Sethu tells in another scene that he is a fan of Shankar-Ganesh! This kind of subversive streak is what makes this film singular and reinforces that Karthik Subbaraj as one of the exciting filmmakers of our time."

Venu Kanna, Harish and Kapil Dev are school friends who are spending their summer vacation in their small town. One day, they witness a crime which forces them to confront their boyhood and when the culprits manage to go scot free, the trio decides to get them their deserved punishment, chiefly by relying on their wits.\r\n\r\nWhile the boys discovering the culprits and bringing them to the book is the main plot, this is pushed to the sidelines now and then with tension killing sub-plots like the boys' infatuation with a couple of girls (too filmy), an animated segment on a Hindu-Muslim riot (indulgent) and a little too many coming-of-age moments (overlong); though, the scene in which a character has his first wet dream is treasure-worthy. The pace during the first hour is definitely leisurely and less lively it is only with a chase in the second half that the film hits its stride. It isn't exactly too late because once it finds its rhythm, Poovarasam Peepee turns into a thrilling ride with its irresistible David vs Goliath plot.\r\n\r\nWe had Goli Soda earlier this year which, too, revolved around a similar plot, but the films vastly differ in their sensibilities. Poovarasam Peepee is, in fact, closer in spirit to Enid Blyton's adventure stories, especially the Famous Five books, and Halitha deserves credit for the manner in which the three boys go about their task of implicating the criminals. The methods that the boys employ to get evidence of the crime are all plausible and never feel too grown-up. She gives all three characters traits that give us the impression that these boys are capable of doing what they do. Harish is shown as a tech wiz and so, we do not question the use of a military radio, which becomes an important tool in their battle. Venu has spunk and a sharp mind and thus saves them from getting caught twice. As for Kapil Dev, who is less studious than his friends, he is a team player who is resourceful enough and pitches in when it matters the most. And, when they get help from outsiders (an older boy, a fellow classmate), those scenes don't come across as dues ex machina as Halitha integrates them into the lives of the protagonists. The villains, too, aren't sitting ducks. They are violent enough and the only reason why they lose is because the boys are intelligent enough that their foes never guess their identity until the last shot."

And director Ramesh Venkatraman keeps the plot just a little bit convoluted, so that we are unsure of the motivations of the characters and where things are leading to. There are the friends, Guna and Deva, who are aspiring to become police officers when we first see them and they manage to get into the force. There is the power minister Vallarasu, who demands Rs 300 crore as kickback from entrepreneur Rajesh for sanctioning his solar power plant project. The money gets stolen and an inspector is murdered. Guna and Deva are part of the team investigating this crime and their prime suspect is a notorious robber. Meanwhile, a businessman's son is kidnapped and there is suspicion that the same robber might be involved. And Guna stumbles upon a clue that makes him suspect the motives of Deva. What is true? Who can he trust? And, how can he nab the criminal and save the boy? These are the questions for which he has to find answers fast.\r\n\r\nOn paper, this plot promises a thrill ride of a film but sadly, despite having the bare-bones of a solid thriller, the film never feels compelling. A plot that is a web of intrigue and mystery is presented in rather dull fashion. Rather than getting into the plot, we are initially burdened with a lifeless romance (where lovers break into a duet at the prospect of going together to the grocery store!) and an uninvolving drama about Guna's attempts to become a cop. Both the writing and filmmaking at best resemble a student effort. Added to this, none of the leads look the part. They come across more like people at a costume party, and this makes it hard for us to take the characters — and the film — seriously. There is sign of spark here, but one cannot expect audiences to put up with such amateurishness just because it's a low-budget film."

        "content": "Mundasupatti is one heady cocktail when it comes to the genres that the film dabbles in. It is a sci-fi (a meteorite hits a village), a rural drama (the meteorite becomes the deity of a village), a mystery (the space rock goes missing), a period film (the story happens in 1982, with a prelude set in 1947), and of course, there is a romance as well. But it is primarily a comedy. Director Ram Kumar, who is the latest promising find from the TV show Naalaya Iyakkunar, certainly knows how to end a joke with a punchline. In an early scene, we see Gopi, the film's protagonist, lining up a family which has come to his photo studio to have their photograph taken. As he is about to click, his assistant Azhagumani comes with tickets to a newly-released film (this time, it isn't Rajinikanth and Murattu Kaalai, the usual touchstones for period films set in the 80s, but Kamal Haasan and Sagalakala Vallavan), and the two scoot off without taking the photograph to the theatre. But the joke doesn't end there. We see the Gopi and Azhagu having a gala time at the cinema and it is only when they return to the studio in the night, we get the final part of this joke — the family is still there holding their pose! If we had merely been smiling at Gopi's travails in getting the family to pose in the earlier segment, now, we instantly burst into a laugh.\r\n\r\nLike Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom, Mundasupatti, too, is built on a one-note premise — a village and its peculiar superstitions (having photographs taken is bad omen, a deity and the place's lucky charm; if it was a horse that is deified in Azhagarsamiyin Kuthirai, here, a space rock becomes Vaana Muni) — and the variations on this single theme. We laugh when we see that the villagers allow only their dead to be photographed and frame and hang these photos on their walls in memory of the departed. We laugh when we see them refusing to even be in the room when a photograph is being taken. We laugh when both a husband and wife bribe the hero to take a photograph of their spouse so that he/she will depart. And, we laugh when they run for their lives when the hero brandishes the camera when he is being chased.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the gags and jokes don't come at the expense of the filmmaking, as it so often happens in our comedies, which seem flatly shot and hastily staged. Here, there is enough craft on display to make us appreciate the aesthetics, like the sequence where Gopi and Azhagu outwit the henchmen of a zamindar (who hopes to steal the invaluable meteorite for an Englishman), which is stylishly staged. The cheerful score and the lovely camerawork only enhance the effect.\r\n\r\nThe actors, too, are up to the task. Vishnu Vishal, who was last seen in Neerparavai (2012), shows that he has a flair for comedy as well and makes Gopi very relatable. As his sidekick, Kaali Venkat is a scene stealer, while, Ramadas, despite being a little over-the-top, keeps the laughs coming as the wannabe film star Munishkanth. His reaction when he realizes that he has been duped by Gopi and Azhagu is hilarious. Nandita doesn't have much to do but veteran Anandaraj makes a fine return to the screen as the impotent zamindar. His character keeps numerous cats in his place and you will definitely chuckle when you know why.\r\n\r\nAgreed the film is a tad overlong (the climax is clearly extended for the sake of packing in a few more jokes) and some of the comedy feels repetitive but Ram Kumar manages to keep things playful and entertaining at all times (even a scene where a thief is meted out punishment is treated in a lighter vein) that we look past some of the indulgences."

        "content": "It is always a difficult challenge to remake a movie. That too, one that has already garnered a lot of praise like Salt N' Pepper. Prakash Raj seems to have overcome that challenge admirably as his Un Samayalaraiyil does complete justice to the original.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the manner in which the humour sequences have been shot to the deep, meaningful thoughts that the movie manages to trigger in the minds of the viewers without actually coming across as being preachy, the movie has several pluses.\r\n\r\nA large part of the credit for the film's humour must go to Prakash Raj, Thambi Ramaiah and Elango Kumaravel, who, between them, effortlessly bring a smile to your face. In fact, they make you long for sequences featuring them. It's not just the humour parts that they excel in. They are brilliant even when it comes to showcasing the better qualities of being a human like caring for one another.\r\n\r\nA case in point would be the sequence in which Prakash Raj comes home one afternoon in a foul mood. He is served food by the cook, who, it is evident, is doing so for the praise that he hopes Prakash will shower on him after the meal. Unfortunately for him, Prakash Raj loses his temper, asks him to get out, and leaves the house in a huff. Elango Kumaravel, who, until that point in the movie is constantly at loggerheads with the cook, consoles him by praising his dishes. That scene moves you.\r\n\r\nThe film emphasizes several simple yet powerful thoughts such as the fact that love and trust go hand in hand and that, two people, who are in love, must look to sort out their differences all by themselves rather than looking for external help. More importantly, it also hints at the idea that even out of care, one must not overstep boundaries and make a decision for another.\r\n\r\nOne reason for the commendable manner in which the film has shaped up is its cast. Prakash Raj is brilliant in his portrayal of Kalidasan. Fearless at times, dumbfounded at others, Prakash does a fabulous job, handling both the humourous and serious sequences with the same effortless ease. Sneha as Gowri seems a little unconvincing at the start of the film. However, 20 minutes into the film, she shows why she is considered a class act. The lead pair is offered excellent support by Elango Kumaravel, Thambi Ramaiah, Aishwarya and Urvashi. Both Tejus, who plays Prakash's nephew, and Samyuktha Hornad, who plays Sneha's sister, show promise. This apart, one other factor that works in the film's favour is Ilaiyaraja's background score, which is exceptional at several places.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this film is like a nutritious meal that not only fills your stomach but also leaves your taste buds tingling."

But this story sets around the 15 years ago, which was based on the real sportsperson's life story. Lance Armstrong, a cyclist from the Texas and his record breaking back to back wins at the 'The Tour de France'. The film narrates a tale that what he chose to do with the second chance of his life.\r\n\r\nA very interesting biopic, but kind of confusing over what kind of revelation the film is. I mean whether inspiring to fight back the disease, especially what he contributed to the poor and orphan cancer patients, or cheating the game to become a fame. So what I think is it has the both positives and negatives. I liked the balanced screenplay, that is very smart for a controversial person like this.\r\n\r\nIt's like a modern 'Robinhood' tale. But here, he's not stealing from the rich, instead he cheats the game. Those tricks were unbelievable. That's not the right thing to do, but that's what he's good at. Ben Foster was amazing, I'd seen him doing lots of supporting roles, but for this he's the posterboy. This film is a great example that the lies cannot go on forever, sooner or later the justice will be done. People hate him and so this film. There are others who like him as well, but I'm neutral and people like me has to go through a hard time to rate it.\r\n\r\n6½/10"

The story is actually a good one, coming at things from a German undercover perspective, it's nice to see the other side of the coin.

The makers pad out the picture with newsreel footage, while asking us to wait till the last quarter of film before we get some acting action worthy of the title (competently staged). But just when you think you could possible forgive it its sins, it pulls a dead rabbit out of the hat and delivers a turn of events that quite frankly stinks.

The characters were great, but not the unique ones. Everything was enjoyable, I mean it was not a usual annoying teen movie. Well directed because he got a good screenplay that extracted from the book of the same name. The cast was good, nice performances and so it is official that Bella Thorne classified for those mean girl roles.\r\n\r\nAnyway the main character Bianca was so good. Whitman was too old for the role, but outclassed it. Carefully handled to get under the PG13, and it succeeds. So kids with the matured minds are pretty much allowed to watch it and I don't see any serious offensive to keep them away other than facts the film talks about.

This is a Japanese live-action film adapted from the manga series of the same name. I am not saying it was the best zombie film ever, or the decade or even the year, but surely a better film compared to the recent ones. First of all the story is same as most of the same themed films, that the zombie outbreak brings chaos everywhere, and followed by the survival game. The difference in here was the characters and some of the great scenes that lifted the film up.\r\n\r\nHideo, also pronounced as Hero is a 'best newcomer' manga artist award winner a few years back. Now in his 30s looking for a breakthrough in his career. But after receiving a backlash when his book was denied to publish and followed by break up with his girlfriend, he begins to witness a series of strange events around him. While the entire city turned into madness, he and a random school girl join the hands to escape from the horror. So their journey begins to nowhere, but be safe. Later a couple of twists come into play and brings an end to the narration.\r\n\r\nThe script was not praiseworthy, but the filmmaking was, including the performances. The actors had given their best shots. The scenes involving the conflict between humans and zombies were carved so awesomely. Being a film fanatic, I'm used to this kind of themes, so none of these flicks can scare me. Not just the sci-fi horror films, but also the supernatural horrors. That's a drawback. But if I was a normal guy or a little kid, this film would have been in a different league. Still, I enjoyed it. Because overall film offered me a great entertainment.\r\n\r\n> \"What you seek isn't dream anymore! It's delusion. Only a small, special group of people can achieve success.\"\r\n\r\nI don't understand the Japanese, except a few simple words, but from my observation, they never mentioned the word 'zombie'. They called it by the virus that caused it, ZQN. I don't know what those alphabets stand for, but all I got was the word 'Zokyun'. The equivalent English word is 'bang', like a sudden sharp thud sound. Anyway, coming to the film, the characters are unpredictable. You can't trust anyone of them, except our lead guy. Not just because of the infection, but their intentions, more like it is about survival of the fittest. I mean like usual, the man's weakness, power hungry.\r\n\r\nAfter Hideo, the school girl Hiromi is the next in the lead, but there's nothing much to expect from her. They kept that role very mysterious, that I was looking for an explanation which never came. That was really disappointing, but it also mean a hint of a possible sequel. I hope they make one, after all this film was received so well. The details in the film were very impressive, even the small ones. Not just they focused the human characters, they have given strength to zombies to strike the survived human ruthlessly, but uniquely like an athlete. So basically, no traditional zombie theory was followed. They bent the rules to make it a unique product, as well as to entertain the viewers, mostly funnily.\r\n\r\nShot in the fine places, especially in the second half. This film redefined the zombie film from those days before the evolution of superheroes and space-age flicks. It was a perfect mix of comedy, action and thriller. But I laughed surely better than those recent full length comedy flicks that had best comedians. This is not a remake material, so I'm not expecting the west to do that. Like I always say, whatever world film I watch, I'm happy to end up in a Japanese or a French film. It was a bit long, worth it though. I am not overwhelmed and blindly recommending it, but this film was really good, particularly if you like black comedy, sort of.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

The first half was the reason which was very negatively appealed, particularly the racism and police abuse preoccupied rather than telling the actual story. But the next half was much better. I liked it because of that part which crafted so brilliantly. That's where the real journey begins. Well played characters, everybody who repressed those real ones were done incredible job.\r\n\r\nThis film revealed something I did know. Like how the Rap music got so popular. I quite belong to the same generation where this thing got its revolution. It was like another 'Lords of Dogtown' where the young guys made skateboards popular, but here it was the Rap songs. It was a two and half hour long film, longer than an average film length, but the pace was good. Except the strong contents, the narration never looked dull.

All the cast do very well, in truth.\r\n\r\nI love how gritty the film is too, it feels real - at least as real as film can get. There is some neat cinematography in there, while the music is entwinned nicely. The pacing is almost perfect, aside from a few moments in the middle.

As per the television standards, this film succeeds from all the aspects. The casting was good, but the focus was not distributed equally. May be they kept it for the sequels, in each to tell everyone's tale as the centre. So this is about the descendants of the greatest villains of Disney's fairy tales. They all got admitted to the Auradon Prep located near to their banished land. A chance to follow their own path, particularly to cut off bad influences of their parents. But would they accept the offer and make it work or there any agenda to avenge for the past are the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nIt's a musical like any fairytale. But average tracks. The performances were good, even the graphics are very acceptable. So colourful and visually appealing. I think this kind of trend began with the recent success of 'Maleficent'. So you must not expect the moral values, particularly I'm saying it for the parents. Because, this is about the villains and their children, so the majority of the film leans on the negative factors. But as usual, all ends well, if you consider that a message or learning point for your children.\r\n\r\nDirected by 'Hocus Pocus' filmmaker. I was looking forward to watch it since it came out. Finally, I saw it and enjoyed it, but not the great film. The children's would love it, especially those who are familiar with the characters and its origin. Surely lot to expect, but I advise to keep your expectation low to benefit maximum. I have heard, they are already making the second film, which is due later this year.

Raja, a taxi driver, is busy romancing his lover inside his car not realizing that a terrorist has placed a bomb inside it and plans to activate it over phone. If Vasanth succeeds, it will actually help the terrorist execute his plan. Meanwhile, Mukil, a property dealer, is searching for his love interest Simi, who is actually buried under debris in a construction site — with a superheavy stone block dangling over her at a great height. And, the only chance of him saving her is if the mobile network is restored on time.\r\n\r\nThus, Ramprakash Rayappa sets up his story effectively and keeps us on the edge of our seats for the most parts. The manner in which he handles this multi-strand narrative without making it chaotic deserves appreciation. The success lies in how he makes each of these sub-plots interesting.\r\n\r\nVasanth is shown as a tech savant (probably, that's why the character is named as an anagram of the word) who likes to invent things —solar bike, robotic dog, bomb detector, invisible ink, miniature bike with a video camera — and finds being in a job boring. He ghostwrites project reports for college students and one student, Harini, falls in love with him. His mother (a stellar Urvashi) is not quite educated but has learnt a lot about science from her son and can talk about them with conviction. She can even make a clock run by using potatoes as batteries! There is a very amusing scene where Vasanth lets her reply to Harini's messages, that highlights the easygoing relationship between the two.\r\n\r\nRaja is the loudmouth driver who doesn't get a girl because of his indiscreet talking. However, one girl falls for him but he can woo her only with the help of Ramesh, the small-time thief who has stolen his mobile phone. Ramesh also has a part to play in the terrorist's plan and gets the loudest cheer with his actions in the climax.\r\n\r\nBut the track involving Mukil and Simi doesn't feel intrinsic to the plot. Take it away and the film will hardly suffer. Also, their romance seems forced and ridiculous. She is a suicide counselor who mistakes him for a suicide victim while he mistakes her empathy for love. But when they realize the mistake, he tells her that he will continue to love her until she verbally abuses him! And, Dinesh, who still seems to be in Cuckoo mode, and Bindu Madhavi, who is mostly wooden, make one of the most unconvincing romantic pairs in recent times.\r\n\r\nRamprakash Rayappa gives his own spin to the race-against-time thriller with Tamizhukku En 1-Ai Azhuthavum, a solid debut film. Generally, in films of this nature, the hero will have to push himself and beat time and accomplish a task. Here, Ramprakash does what Albert Hitchcock mentioned in his famous conversation with Francois Truffaut while explaining the difference between surprise and suspense. He lets us — the audiences — know the stake while his three leads are hardly aware of what they have in store. We see the bomb being placed, Simi getting buried and the cables holding the stone block snap. Thus, we become active participants in the developments on screen and that makes the film more thrilling than it should have been."

        "content": "Naalu Polisum Nallairutha Oorum (NPNO) begins with a tour of Meiyur, the village where the film is set in. It is a model village where everyone is friendly with one another. The villagers are very accommodative and considerate — when a thief (Yogi Babu) who had come to rob the temple breaks a leg in the process, they do not beat him up and hand him over to the police; instead, they advise him, 'Paathu thirudunga' and mend his broken bones. But most of all, they are virtuous, so much so that they leave a gold chain on the road for two days in the hope the person who lost it might come and find it. This honesty is what has resulted in the village receiving the Best Village award from the president for five consecutive years.\r\n\r\nThis integrity is also what has made the police station in the place redundant — we see a board there saying 'Sunday Holiday'! The station exists mainly as a recreation centre for the four cops, who while away their time watching cricket on the TV or playing carom. And once in a while, they are of use to the villagers who might need help in finding their cows. So, when a letter arrives saying that they are to be transferred to Ramanathapuram, a hotbed of violence, the cops are, naturally, reluctant. And they hatch a plan to register a crime, so that a police station becomes a necessity for the village. What they don't realize is that their actions might have far-reaching conclusions that will not only affect them but also the entire village.\r\n\r\nThe central conceit of NPNO — cops trying to stage a crime to retain their jobs — is taken from the 1939 film Ask A Policeman, and the team has been smart enough to acknowledge it in pre-release interviews. While that film uses the premise for a whimsical comedy that is distinctly British, debutant NJ Srikrishna uses it to tell a conventional story with an even more familiar message that involves Newton's third law.\r\n\r\nThe first half is engaging enough as we are introduced to the place and the characters, including the four cops played by Arulnidhi, Singampuli, Bhagavathi Perumal and Rajkumar. Though Arulnidhi, as the hero gets a cheeky introduction scene (in true masala movie style, where bullets bend and bounce off things to hit their targets) and a romantic track (that is very blah), it is Singam Puli who comes across as the protagonist. He gets to be in most of the scenes and his antics in these portions are quite hilarious. The skit-level humour is entertaining for a while, but after a point, we start wishing for little more sophistication in the writing and filmmaking (which is in TV drama territory). But the second half is more of a letdown, mainly because the director has difficulty in maintaining the tone of the film, which abruptly changes from farce to realism (read preachy), and by the time we reach the bleak — and abrupt — ending, we feel as if we have ended up in a different film."

Many actors had tried that and only a few had succeeded, but some of them just preferred a low cost, simple project to avoid a major disaster. He also produced it and acted alongside the British actress Alice Eve. The film was a one night event based theme which begins when a young woman misses her train, and later forced to spend the night with a stranger after her purse got stolen. During lots of time left for the next train, theirs little adventure begins as they embark around the city.\r\n\r\nThis is really a solid film. Well written screenplay and performed with a beautiful night adventure in the city that never sleeps. The problem with me was, I had seen many similar flicks, so this one looked okay, in a good way, but not that awesome. Still a fine film and definitely highly recommend others who like drama-romance. The plus point was the actors, the chemistry was brilliant. The story was very good, yet like I said it was so simple.\r\n\r\nIt was not just two who meet and develop a friendship or a relationship, but they both reveal their story behind their visit to the city. At first it was a casual disclose, but the true reason comes out when they begin to trust each other and feel comfortable. So each of their tale has a small twist in the same night to overcome that was troubling them for some time. The film makes the impression that they two are made for each other, but only the final scene reveals how their destiny ends when the dawn breaks out. Not so clever, but an enjoyable little gem, maybe a perfect film for the date night.\r\n\r\n6.5/10"

        "content": "'The Martian’ is definitely in the creative wheelhouse of filmmaker Ridley Scott whose Science Fiction sensibilities are grounded in colorful futuristic fantasies that tiptoe in grand whimsy.  The veteran auteur responsible for such pop cultural high-minded spectacles in ‘Alien’, ‘Blade Runner’ and even the mixed bag reception of ‘Prometheus’ certainly brings a sophisticated and thought-provoking vibe to the probing aura of ‘The Martian’. As with other Scott-helmed productions, ‘The Martian’ settles nicely in its majestic scope that taps into visual wonderment, humanistic curiosities, technical impishness and the surreal spryness of the SF experience.\r\n\r\nThe exploratory nature of ‘The Martian’ is its own noteworthy mission. Scott arms his frothy planetary odyssey with a sense of thematic inquisitiveness and intelligence while meshing human consciousness and scientific forethought. Clearly, ‘The Martian’ is astutely meditative and one can thankfully block in their memory banks some of Scott’s mediocre misses (anyone care to recall the monumental mishaps in the form of the flimsy ‘The Counselor’ or the unintentional laughfest that was ‘Exodus: Gods And Kings’?). Rightfully so, ‘The Martian’ shares its crafty crater of similarities with other space-place spectacles that resonated with the imagination and innovation such as the Academy Award-winning ‘Gravity’ and the under-rated ‘Interstellar’. \r\n\r\nQuite frankly, ‘The Martian’ is elegantly arresting in its sheer skin for both the character studies and the major plight involved (particularly anchored on the shoulders of star Matt Damon as the contemplative lead) as well as the trademark Scott-induced flourishes that incorporate crisp and cunning visual special effects and a sweeping musical score that invites a transfixing hold on one’s indelible spirit.\r\n\r\n‘The Martian’ is the film adaptation of Andy Weir’s best-selling tome. Scott’s disciplined direction and screenwriter Drew Goddard’s ambitious vision of Weir’s compelling written material seemingly gels in convincing, cerebral fashion. The premise is not wildly original as it revisits the familiar foundation of a lost soul in survival mode trying to take on the treacherous surroundings with philosophical conviction. Nevertheless, this does not make ‘The Martian’ any less formidable in its soul-searching perspective. Scott’s narrative on individualism and isolation with a tremendous technological tilt truly registers with boisterous bounce. Amazingly, Scott has assembled a capable and committed cast that are dedicated to making ‘The Martian’ look resourcefully skillful in its masterful mischievousness. Sure, The Martian’s lengthy running time is staggering but it is compelling enough to invest in its meandering, adventurous narrative.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate nightmare (or perilous predicament…take your choice) has been realised for one stranded space traveler in Mark Watney (Matt Damon). You see…poor astronaut Watney had the misfortune of losing contact with his commander in Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and the rest of his crew when undergoing a scientific expedition to examine the terrain on Mars. Courtesy of an unexpected freakish storm Watney is separated from his comrades and believed to be dead as a result of the hazardous weather conditions on Mars. Lewis and her associates have no choice but to head back to Earth as searching for Watney may prove to be futile and endanger their lives as well.\r\n\r\nThus, Mark Watney is basically his own forced-upon version of ‘Robinson Crusoe On Mars’. There is no option for Watney but to allow his major survival instincts to kick in while striving for his jeopardised livelihood on the unpredictable and treacherous Red Planet’s jagged landscape. Despite being stuck in hostile territory, Watney must use his background skills as a trained botanist to cultivate the scarce food he must rely on for his unconventional nutrition. The only ‘companion’ that Watney has to relate to rests in the recorded device that captures his harried thoughts through video diaries (at least this is more practical than what Tom Hanks’s ‘Castaway’ character had in his possession with inanimate object best buddy, Wilson the volleyball).\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the devastating news about Mark Watney’s possible death far beyond the reaches of home hits his colleagues understandably hard as tributes start to pour in remembrance of the seemingly dearly departed space pioneer. Soon, there is some measure of hope when NASA officials that include head honchos Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels from TV’s ‘The Newsroom’), Vincent Kapoor (the Oscar-nominated Chiwetel Ejiofor from ’12 Years A Slave’) and Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) find evidence that Watney may be alive and ready to be rescued. Naturally, a sense of urgency is warranted to retrieve the weary astronaut without causing too many public relations waves. This puts press aide Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig) into damage control mode in particular.\r\n\r\nOkay...so it is not as scenic as Yellowstone National Park but the rocky region in THE MARTIAN still has some unassuming charm, right?\r\nOkay…so it is not as scenic as Yellowstone National Park but the rocky region in THE MARTIAN still has some unassuming charm, right?\r\nImportantly, ‘The Martian’ is clever and carefully conceived because it does not have to rely on the excess baggage to convey its entertainment value in a series of hyperactive and hedonistic happenings. Ridley Scott is soundly methodical in presenting a low-key terrifying tale of loneliness and resiliency and what it takes to handle the pressure of adversity when there is no glimmer of humanity around to reinforce or remind one of such psychological obstacles. The intriguing factor here is the science-friendly serving of intelligence and insight that builds up the audience’s appreciation for the underlying suspense. Interestingly, the conflict approached in ‘The Martian’ is not so much the back-and-forth high-scale struggles of man versus outlandish creature or an over-the-top diabolical deviant out to destroy the world in cartoonish fashion. No, the genuine combative and confrontational war of will is contained in one vulnerable man’s ability to face the unknown grounded in both doubt and determination. Hence, Scott has made a palpable thinking man’s Science Fiction exposition rooted in articulated forethought.\r\n\r\nDamon more than holds his own as the disillusioned botanist/astronaut out on an ominous limb as his doomed odyssey of uncertainty is something that the common viewer can embrace and relate to without question. The perceived opulence in ‘The Martian’ is not contained in the film’s production values per se (Scott has made previous movies with more visual vitality and purpose) but subtly showcased in the concepts of  knowledgeable tidbits concerning food rations, mathematical equations, crucial time tables, planetary probes, NASA-themed procedural techniques and aerodynamics considerations.\r\n\r\nHopefully, ‘The Martian’ is not dismissed as a foreign alien in the minds of ardent movie-going SF enthusiasts looking for a realistic and soulful space-age adventure with a refreshing backbone of scientific curiosity and candidness.\r\n\r\nThe Martian (2015)\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 35 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Donald Glover and Benedict Wong\r\n\r\nDirected by: Ridley Scott\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction/Space Adventure/Science and Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic’s rating: *** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)"

        "content": "This is a movie that I have to say that I have a bit of a difficulty in rating. Quite honestly I was sorely tempted to remove a star, or even two stars. Why? Because it is full of Hollywood nonsense, scientific errors, it is rather predictable and it did feel a bit like a Apollo 13 rip-off. Why did I not remove those stars? Well, it is rather entertaining even if, at times, I squirmed in my seat.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with a somewhat implausible event where a unexpected storm hits the Mars camp which forces the ground crew of the Mars mission to hurry back to the launch vehicle before it tilts over. The launch vehicle gradually tilts a degree at the time. Is it just me finding this strange? Would storms on Mars defy the usual rules of weather dynamics that they would exert a constant pressure which would cause a slow but constant tilt of a construct like that. No gusts, no change in pressure? And why would it gradually tilt at all? Once the force would be enough for the landing struts on one side to leave the ground it would pretty much tilt right away. Okay, I am being picky so lets give that a benefit of a doubt for the time being.\r\n\r\nObviously one guy is lost during the dramatic events. This is equally obviously 100% predictable. The fact that the guy is still alive after the rest of the crew blasted off is obviously also 100% predictable but then, this you should have pretty figured out from the title of the move after all.\r\n\r\nA lot of the rest of the movie is following this guys quest for survival on Mars using the left over equipment at his disposal and the NASA crew on Earth trying to rescue him. Yes the NASA crew on Earth does discover that he is alive which, again, is pretty much predictable. Of course this gave Hollywood the opportunity to add a utterly dislikable political bureaucrat that is pretty much in the movie for one reason and one reason alone…to be dislikable. Personally I just found him tiresome. But then, Americans seems to like these kind of people given the kind of trash that we see being pushed towards the upcoming presidential elections…from both sides!\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of good stuff in the movie. Even though it is rather predictable there are some suspense in it, there are a lot of good scenery, and even though you pretty much knows what is going to happen you do feel like cheering for the hero. Given the script I think a lot of the actors did a rather good job of their roles.\r\n\r\nIf the script writers would have brought on some decent scientific advisors I would say this would have been a great movie but it was frequently goofed up with issues that was just stupid. Like digging down a nuclear reactor a few feet in the ground. What the f… good was that supposed to do? And the constant use of simple plastic and duct tape to seal the environment. Yeah, right. Sure, Mars do have some atmosphere so it is not vacuum we are talking about but then in other scenes they seemed to assume almost zero atmosphere and made quite a bit use of explosive decompression effects.\r\n\r\nOkay, okay I am probably nitpicking quite a bit here but, unlike many Science Fiction movies, this one tries to give an impression of being within the realms of realism and it is just too full of classical Hollywood mishaps for my taste.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote above I still think it is a movie worth watching. It has some suspense, it is well done from a photographic point of view and the actors are doing a decent job. I think 7 out of 10 stars is a fair rating but it should certainly not have more."

Jeff Daniels plays the director of NASA while Jessica Chastain plays the leader of the vessel.

If, like me, you’re fascinated by Mars or the potential of living on another planet in the real world, “The Martian” is a must.\r\n\r\nIt’s reminiscent of movies like “Armegeddon” (1998), “Mission to Mars” (2000), “Gravity” (2013) and “2001: A Space Odyssey” (1968), albeit without the fantastical elements of some of these. It even brings to mind the first acts of “Planet of the Apes” (1968) and “Beneath the Planet of the Apes” (1970). \r\n\r\nThe movie scores pretty well on the female front with Chastain, Mackenzie Davis, Kate Mara and Kristen Wiig.

        "content": "I feel like this science fiction movie was a stunning achievement, for at least a couple of reasons. Firstly, for much of the time it is a one man show, and that can be risky in a feature length film. It worked with acclaimed actors Tom Hanks in Cast Away, and with Robert Redford in All is Lost, but could it work with Matt Damon in a sci-fi flick? Well, I answer that question with a resounding ‘yes.’\r\n\r\nThe movie does cut away to planet Earth and the spaceship returning home without him, so it isn’t all Damon all the time. And some humor is injected here and there to offset the character’s grim situation. I liked the line where he referred to himself as the greatest biologist on the planet. As the only current resident on Mars at that time, he was also the worst biologist on the planet!\r\n\r\nAnother reason this film is remarkable is because there is a lot of science here, which drives the plot as he has to solve continuous problems that arise, not with brute strength or other physical,skills, but with his analytical mind. And yet the details don’t get tedious or overly  technical. Oddly enough, it is not a movie I will watch multiple times, as I have lesser robust sci-fI entries such as Super 8 or Monsters, but I plan to watch it at least one more time, just out of appreciation for the solid job that was done in adapting what much must have been a very challenging story to film and have it be both entertaining and informative, both scientific and an  amazing adventure."

Thing is, once the dust has (quite literally) settled, we discover that \"Watney\" (Matt Damon) is anything but. Impaled by an antenna needle he is alive and alone. Now a sort of space-bound \"Robinson Crusoe\" adventure ensues with \"Watney\" trying to ensure he repairs the damage to his body the uses his training - as a botanist - to find a way to survive.

I found this at it's most effective when it is just Damon using his guile to find innovative ways to survive. I can't swear to the plausibility of the science, but peppered with some pithy pieces-to-camera in a video diary style and his favourite (not) disco music Damon ensures that the film builds nicely allowing us to invest in his survival. I began to lose interest once the political melodrama kicked in, though, and but for the last exciting twenty minutes, I felt the film lost it's way as the scientific responses all just became a little too predictably convenient and oddly enough for a science fiction film, far-fetched!

Besides a single mother fighting for a child custody as a subplot and other few extra characters were added for the movie to brighten up. That did not help to make the plot tighter and faster, instead left behind many unanswered. Anyway, most part of the narration stayed dry.\r\n\r\nLooking at the performances, location and the direction, it was not a bad movie. The story that progressed at a lazy pace is what I felt is the tumble. It should have been better, but still watchable film and not for everyone. It is another movie about the life's hardship. All about the personal life as well as the social life and finding a way to blend them together. Great cast, fine music and a decent ending. Overall, failed to impress, but worth a watch for being different and a slightly gripping due to the realistic approach.\r\n\r\n6½/10"

        "content": "**In the circle of romance, deceive and defraud.**\r\n\r\nThose who are into the world cinema, particularly the Korean, knows Park Chan-wook very well. But if you don't, then you must. His films are definitely for the grown ups. Like everybody else, my admiration for his work has started a decade ago with the film 'Oldboy'. He had tried his luck in Hollywood with 'Stoker'. Despite a good entertainer, it was criticised. I love Park Chan-wook doing hundred masterpieces like this in Korea than trying to do one in Hollywood. His ability to turn the good book into a great flick was phenomenal. Here it goes another one. This was based on the British novel 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters. The story of an orphan woman who assigned to be a maid for a young rich woman who is living under the shadow of her uncle since she has no parents.\r\n\r\nYeah, I was expecting it, but I did not think it would be another masterpiece from the director. I even thought the ratings could be exaggerated, and the reviews from his die hard fans like Nolan's or QT's fans does. The timeline of the story was prior to Second World War Korea under the Japan rule. A perfect setting for such theme. The film opened like it is an average film. That's where all I got wrong. Or probably I judged it too soon. The storytelling was split into three parts and the first part was a bit mix of fun and like any film, introduction, the platform for the rest of the narration filled with surprises.\r\n\r\nThe young orphan Sook-hee was recruited by a thief who is planning to trick a young woman named Lady Hideko with all the wealth left behind by her parents. The only obstacle for him is her uncle, a guardian. So Sook-hee becomes close to her. More than she had expected, but their plan is working. Now they have to wait for the perfect moment for a perfect strike. When it arrives, an unexpected twist takes the tale to go back to where the film originally had started. But even further earlier and this time, the perspective of the story was from the Lady Hdeko.\r\n\r\n> ❝So even if my love for you leads me to ruin, don't pity me.❞\r\n\r\nSo, with that flashback, the second part begins. But literally it was a series of twist, that keep explaining us in another angle of the whole scenario I had witnessed in the previous part. Believe me, I have never seen such a long twist before. I was like unmoved for that entire segment. One of the best things I have ever in a film. The praise must go to the author, but the director and his actors as well did a fine job. There's a twist in every scene. So, for that one must pay close attention to the first part, despite slow moving story.\r\n\r\nBut above all, what I'm surprised was I did not know it was a lesbian film. Moreover, I did not think it could have bold scenes for such theme. Everything seemed perfect. I mean the erotic parts are sensual, but very artistic than unnecessary disturbance. Mainly because of stronger hold of the story narration than anything else. Even the pace picks up, like a crazy speed. Everything about the film you would learn in this section. All the secrets of the past revealed and what might comes are still kept under mysterious for the third and final part.\r\n\r\nThe most awaited, the conclusion part begins forth. For everything we saw so far, what might come after makes this film at its best. Just like the mid part, this is also full of twists. Because it will going to tell who ends where and what they get. Over two hours long film, and every frame are worth. The casting was best and so the setting of the 1930s Korea. Especially I must applaud the filmmaker's effort to turn the original setting from Europe to East Asia. It was great, but still now and then you can see the influence of the original source. I mean western culture, names, architect references which might have come from the book.\r\n\r\nNot just the lesbian or a love triangle story, but something like a circle of love with deceive and defraud. You can notice that in the film poster with four main characters. So when it has a multiple strings attached, you could expect surprises/twists from each angle and it gives that more the convincingly. Put this into your must see list. This is not the first screen adaptation, but surely the best so far. Now we can expect a European or a Hollywood project in a big scale soon. Believe me the Oscars would pour in, because it's that kind of story. Highly recommended!\r\n\r\n_8/10_"

        "content": "Talk about the best laid plans! This is a cracking, sexy, thriller set in Korea during the Japanese occupation of the 1930s. It centres around the charming, butter-wouldn't-melt \"Sook-Hee\" (Tae Ri Kim) who takes a job attending the wealthy \"Lady Hideko\" (Kim Min-hee). She lives on a grand estate with her cantankerous uncle \"Kouzuki\" (Cho Jin-woong) and is frankly rather low maintenance for her new maid. Pretty quickly, though, we begin to smell a rat! Is she what she seems, and what has the obviously duplicitous \"Count\" (Ha Jung-woo) got to do with things? Well gradually, we find out that there are schemes afoot to rob the lady of her fortune, her liberty - even her mind. What the plotting didn't take account for, though, was human nature. A bond gradually starts to build between the two women, a bond of friendship, of trust - of love! What happens next...? This benefits hugely from having a tightly-knit cast who work well together; a solid and intriguing story that marries the Machiavelian with the mischievous, the sexy with the sordid - and, it looks great too. The characters vacillate from being likeable, kinky, and often pretty loathsome in equal measure, but somehow there is always a sense that right will be done! I loved the ending, and the performances from the two women are engaging and captivating. Some of it isn't for the squeamish, but it flew by, is expertly crafted, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."

It is self-indulgent, no point in saying that the audience of (us) cinema goers were ever likely be the prime beneficiaries of this creation, but oddly enough it is exactly what it says on the tin \"Quixotic\". I am not sure it was worth waiting 29 years for, but it has a few laugh out loud moments and a carefully crafted soundtrack helps keep it lolling along. I'm not sure I will ever watch it again, but I am glad I have seen it."

Well, there is one great fly in that particular ointment and we have to wait until the last ten minutes or so to really find out that this has much more going on as we discover no lack of suspects or plausible plot lines that lead us to question what we know we saw at the start. Sonia Dresdel (\"Steffy\") is on good form and the small and well focussed cast keeps the suspense taut and engaging. The score and lighting add bundles to the mystery too - and with a soupçon of Nazi undertones the whole film is really quite a good watch."

        "content": "> A small contribution by everyone matters a lot.\r\n\r\nThe organism survives only if the surrounding environment favours. But it takes thousands of years of evolution to find its right place. Its existence is only to restore the balance in the nature as much as fast it can. Because the organism moves one place to another and help elements to meet one another which can't do themselves, in a result the reaction happen. The extinction happens when the balance between naturally existing elements and living organism was disturbed. The Earth has seen such five mass extinctions and now on the verge of sixth only because of one species, the man. There's no one in this universe to question his supremacy, but himself in the form of scientists, environmentalist et cetera. This documentary talks one of that small topic, analysing its root cause.\r\n\r\nFrom the Academy Award winning director for the documentary 'The Cove', once again, his focus came to bring the awareness about marine species that disappearing due to excessive hunting. From Japan's dolphin hunt to now the focus is on the Chinese's misbelief that causing animals like tigers, rhinos, marine animals to face the threat.\r\n\r\nIn this film, the Oceanic Preservation Society followed the source to find how and where it all begins. Since it is related to marine life - shark fin and manta ray gill trade markets were the target. That leads the crew to travel all the way to Indonesia, where a small coastal village is one of the major supplier to the Chinese consumer.\r\n\r\n> \"We have this illusion that it's the big things in the environment that count. But if you lose the small things... Everything else fails.\"\r\n\r\nFor the Chinese population density, just think what might cause if they believe in something that is not right. Since the rise of China's middle class, they can offer anything from anywhere in the world. Because of this demand the rich in biodiversity like India, Africa, Indonesia is affected due to poaching and other illegal activities. What they need is proper scientific education about their misbelief. Make the Chinese immigrants to mingle with the rest of the world, not to live and die in their own den called 'China city'.\r\n\r\nI am not a Chinese hater, but their misbelief is outrageous, especially for their population strength, it is 5 to 10 times faster than what the rest of the world's misbelief causing threat. Every nation has its own negatives, today it is China, tomorrow it will be India and then United States followed by Europe and Africa. Now it is not only up to the world leaders, but every citizen has to care, even a small contribution means a lot. The recent Paris climate conference has brought only a small halt, especially on the natural resourcing, yet other similar field has to come into force in a similar treaty.\r\n\r\nThe civilisation happened when human thought he does not fit with the natural habitat anymore for his excessive brain power and left it once for all behind other species by creating his own world alongside. Animal and plant farming is the way he discovered to cope with his hunger. But what we don't know is these farming is still occurring on the face of the earth that contributes whatever the changes the planet sees. But that does not it, overpopulation is another bigger issue. There are more consumers than farmers and farm products, thus leading us to go back to wild to hunt which is seriously causing imbalance in chemical and biological world.\r\n\r\n> \"So, this is really the last line of defense, keeping animals that are extinct in the wild in a captive situation.\"\r\n\r\nGoats, sheeps, chickens never go extinct, not under the human watch. Because since the time of human came to exist, till now, these livestock animals' count exceeds more than any other species ever lived on the Earth, including human. You breed it immoderately and kill it immoderately, it does not matter till you're not affecting the natural inhabitant.\r\n\r\nMy point is these animals need plants and if plants go extinct, the oxygen supply will be cut off leading global warming to the next mass extinction. So it needs to be balanced, which can be done by balancing daily our diet between meat and plant. When the demand automatically reduce, the restoration begins. Here the 'automatically' means in the hands of humanity.\r\n\r\nThat's what this film is trying to say. Focusing on the marine was their prime intention, but the discussion led to many other sub-topics. Unlike the director's previous film, it did not stay on one issue, but kept rotating on the various subjects by revealing the causes and the solution. At some point it lost its track, and started to advertise a fancy stuff. But that is a major way getting the attention of today's people in the digital world. Whatever you might think of me, but the truth is I was heartbroken several times while watching this film and had tears. This film is not a masterpiece, that's why it did not get an Oscars nominee except for an original song, nevertheless the voice it raised against is a true commitment.\r\n\r\nRecently I stopped to visit zoos, the place I consider is a prison for animals who have committed no crimes. But in todays world situation, looks like the captive is the final line of defence. If there is a another world, people with much more vigilant about their natural world, I would definitely like to go for it. But earth is what we all have and we're failing to take care, when it comes time to run, you will have no place to go. Just look at the recent reports of pollution in the Chinese cities, it is what I had seen in movies like 'The Mist', 'The Road', is all coming true. The apocalypse is not too far from reality. Like in this film say, it is not too late to join hands for good.\r\n\r\n10/10"

For a start, I couldn't decide whether Ana de Armas was really Lady Gaga or Scarlett Johansson (both of whom would have acquitted themselves better, I'd say) as she offers an admittedly intense, but remarkably uninvolved performance. We move along from chapter to chapter in her life hindered by some fairly weak and uninspiring dialogue and seriously intrusive scoring in what becomes an increasingly shallow and lacklustre fashion. The photography does try hard - it does offer us a sense of intimacy, but the whole thing is presented in such a stylised and un-natural manner that it is frequently difficult to tell whether she is/was a \"real\" woman. Her marriages are treated in an almost scant manner - and her relationship with JFK is reduced to something rather implausibly one-sided and sordid showing nothing of how their relationship might have come to be. It has no soul, this film. Aside from her glamour - which was, even then, hardly unique we are not really introduced to any of the nuances of her character, we are left guessing a lot of the time as to just how she did become such a superstar, and how she spiralled so inevitably into a maelstrom of booze and pills. It relies to a considerable extent on the viewer's existing knowledge of, and affection for, this flawed lady. Adrien Brody and Bobby Cannavale don't really have much chance to add anything as her husbands and the highly speculative relationship between her and Charlie Chaplin Jnr (Xavier Samuel) and his sexually ambiguous partner-in-crime Edward G Robinson Jr (Scoot McNairy) does suggest something of the rather profligate and debauched existence that some lived in Hollywood, but again their characters are also largely undercooked and again, we are largely left to use our own imagination. It is far, far too long and in a packed cinema, I could see people looking at the ceiling just once too often. Watchable, certainly, but a real missed opportunity to offer us something scintillating and tantalising about this most of iconic of women."

I'm really disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe film has nowhere to hold on, it's just a fictional compilation of the supposed life of **Marilyn Monroe**, where we don't get context and it's easy to get lost through the scenes and the large number of characters (_which if you didn't know the story, you wouldn't really know who they are_) of a feature film of almost three hours. The direction is good, although quite experimental where sometimes elements that seem to come out of nowhere are combined. Not to mention the constant switching between color and black/white that doesn't seem to represent anything concrete.\r\n\r\n**Ana de Armas's** performance is brilliant, by far the best of the film, despite how poor her character is.\r\n\r\nI'm really disappointed, in these times we live in, designing a movie about **Marilyn Monroe** could have contained a much more powerful message. The story of a woman who went through the sexualization of the industry in the 50's. Instead the film only seems to add fuel to the fire by showing nudity at any time and sometimes for no reason.\r\n\r\nBased on a story in parts fictitious, with a vision, in my opinion, poorly focused, they make 'Blonde' a great disappointment."

This is a story of 4 directors, setting out to 4 short films revolving around the theme “death”, given to them by the mysterious producer. If you find this baseline to be interesting, wait till you watch the film. It is an enthralling experience from start to finish. Srijit Mukherjee, for my eyes, is a master story-teller. He weaves magic in the form entertaining stories.\r\n\r\nThe film touches multiple genres, with a brilliant narrative structure. The narration is easily the best among Indian films in the past year. The skips, the cuts, time lapses, the transitions between real and reel are a pure treat to watch. \r\n\r\nFor example, there is a scene where a director is narrating his story, and we are cut to a frame where the lead character is featured in the middle of a room. The director is seen to be placing articles in the room, apparently being in the process of production design or “art direction”. He is then interrupted by another director who is listening to the story, and the visual of the director inside his “character’s” room stops what he’s doing, turns around and answers the question. Well, that just took the candidness of the film to another level! There are many more unconventional moments such as this which are bound to make you fall in love with Srijit the audacious story-teller .\r\n\r\nThere is this funeral post-climax, and I honestly feel it was one brilliant piece in this big jigsaw puzzle. There is no “rain” at the funeral and no “dark” color-grading. Just simple and straight-forward stuff, no cliches. And it also evokes few laughs, you’ll know when you watch it. \r\n\r\nThings aren’t complicated, neither are they superficial. There are many underlying themes like retribution and death, which are put forth in the most inventive ways possible. And then there’s the social commentary as well. I leave it to you to figure out where it is placed. You’ll be amazed when you realise the placement. The songs are beautiful, with the female version “Basanto Eshe Geche” standing out tall. The background score is adequate, and the overall production value, slick. I felt there were few unwanted characters and few minutes of screentime wasted on them. Maybe they simply can’t be replaced, but could have been done away with completely. They don’t add anything to the story in terms of progression. \r\n\r\nParambrata Chaterjee is a revelation, be it his body language or dialogue delivery. The dialogue where he references Clint Eastwood is a scene where he reaches another level of eccentricity! He is one actor who could, in the near future, be the face of indie flicks in our part of the world…\r\n\r\nAlready among the best Indian films of 2014, Chotushkone is a ride one must not miss. Though not visually arresting, the screen will have your attention, thanks to the actors and situations they go through. And there are the unexpected twists thrown at us, which will leave you watching in glee. With all the detailing and commentary on contemporary cinema, this is one film every cinephile should watch once in his life."

It was based on the documentary short of the same name about a real life same sex couple who fought for the equal rights and the pension benefits, while one of them was treated for cancer. It is a great drama about fighting for justice than the romance as it states, but that part as well very impressive.\r\n\r\nEllen Page and Julianne Moore, both were awesome, except Moore was a bit old. By seeing them I felt being a lesbian is sweetest than straight, hetero and even gay. The first half was all about the relationship, but very decently narrated romance tale. And in the next half once Steve Carell enters the scene, the film diverted to another side of the story. All the actors were very good, including Michael Shannon.\r\n\r\nObviously the story was predictable and that is expected often in a biography. Because if they want to alter it, then they should pen a very cleverest script the audience never saw one like that before. I think telling a true story as it is is the point and that's what this filmmaker did. So don't complain about the storyline, just consider whether it is inspiring or worth a watch for other reasons.\r\n\r\nFor me it was almost a sentimental piece, but the second half story compromised and then I realised what this film was trying to say. Underrated film of the year for sure. Anytime I suggest it, especially for the grown ups and with a neutral mindset, because it is not all about the same sex romance, but the battle for equality in society.\r\n\r\n8/10"

        "content": "So it was all filmed on my favourite iPhone - the 5S. I had one until only recently when the failing battery finally forced me onto the 12 mini. Aside from that impressive technical feat, though, this really isn't anything special. \"Sin-Dee\" (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) gets out of jail after a 28 day stint for possession, only to find that the guy she took the fall for - her boyfriend \"Chester\" (James Ransone) has been fooling around with \"Dinah\" (Mickey O'Hagan). Livid, she sets off with her best friend \"Alexandra\" (Mya Taylor) to find this woman and to confront her beau with his treachery. Meantime, cabbie \"Razmik\" (Karren Karagulian) breaks up that narrative with some quite entertaining vignettes with his passengers. \"Mia\", a man named after a bird, a couple who have been over-indulging in pre-Christmas booze - and leave him a smelly, unwanted gift - all whilst he cruises for some transvestite action in an alleyway. The stories gradually merge together as it turns out the married Armenian driver has the hots for \"Sin-Dee\" and it all comes to an head in a donut shop with his wife, child, mother-in-law as well! The handheld photography is intimate, presenting us with a fly on the wall style documentary around half a dozen not especially nice or interesting people going about their lives. It is made largely on the move, there is rarely a let up as the story fluidly moves along - but that story is frankly pretty lame. \"Sin-Dee\" drags \"Dinah\" around downtown LA in her bare feet at will; nobody intervenes - even when she drags her onto a bus! The dialogue is weak and angry, the characters selfish and I found that after about half an hour I just couldn't really care less about any of them. Is it supposed to be about friendship? They all appear to be as ready to betray each other as to get up in the morning. Sean Baker does create a film here that is intense, but there is nothing to hook the audience. If this were documentary on transvestite hookers in LA, then it would show nobody in anything like a sympathetic light and adding dialogue to that doesn't change that basic sentiment. As an example of how film-making is going to change profoundly with the advent of small, hand-held, filming technologies this is a great example of a flexible and portable technique. As a story about people, it is pretty miserable."

        "content": "> In the dark hours where everything's so alive.\r\n\r\nBased on the manga series of the same name. A movie about a chef, foods and his small restaurant that opens at midnight till the dawn. There are random scenes with fresh characters all along, but it also centres on a set of few particular characters to stabilise the development. Whatsoever the tale sticks around the restaurant and reveals every happenings, no matter what characters they are.\r\n\r\nA very fun, realistic, calm narration, with cool characters. Anyone slurping their food around me really annoys, but that's the way of pleasurably consuming food among the east Asians, especially that makes me my mouth-watering. So I suggest you better have some snacks with, at least you will have something with you while watching this delicious movie.\r\n\r\nInitially I did not know whose story it was, but a chef began to narrate his story by telling about his tiny restaurant located somewhere in the middle of partially both residential and commercial areas. And his unique customers with their stories that definitely gets our attention. In the meantime a young female character was introduced who is going to be a prime focus for the rest of the film that told alternately with other small happenings around.\r\n\r\n> \"Don't let your tears enter the stew pot. Tears is salt after all. It will change the taste.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether it was the great performances or the writing and direction that brought a soul to it, but overall it was so simple and very likeable film that looks like kind of everything worked so finely. Of course the cultural influence was a big impact. The society, its people with their state of mind and lifestyle - totally moving. Other than the whaling, I don't see the reasons to I hate this beautiful country and its people. I think that's why I loved this film like usual and it is one of my favourite film industry.\r\n\r\nImpressive, how the customers respect their chef by calling him master. I have seen the actor who played that important role in the movie 'Quill'. He was excellent in this with his casual effort. There's no way to predict anything from the movie. It would be like you go and sit in a small restaurant near you for a whole day, interacting with every customer who gets in with their story of the day with all kinds of moods, that's how watching this film feels like with surprises.\r\n\r\nThose who read the original manga and those who saw the television series might have reason to compare with this to bring some positive and negative points, but as I'm not familiar with other material, I ended with very happy for this.\r\n\r\nThe runtime really scared me, but once sat for it, I spent those two hours without any trouble. This kind of storytelling really suits for television to split into plenty of episodes, but the movie was equally amazing and can be compared to any top movies related to 'food, chef and restaurant' themes. This was a great drama with fine humours. I want to suggest it and I surely do, especially for those who love drama films with a moderate pace.\r\n\r\n8/10"

This is an English language film, because they have targeted the American market. Many similar Hollywood flicks were already made, so it is just a different actors and the locations. But the actings were good and some of the scenes were nicely composed. This is a book based film about an ex- con, when he comes to know his daughter is in a real trouble, he does everything he can to protect her. So it is like a running and chasing kind of theme, but how they come out it is the remaining film.\r\n\r\nMel Gibson was great. I felt like I haven't seen him for ages, I mean this kind of performance gives the impression that he's back. Though the film was not that great, for an entertainment it will do okay. It is a short film than usual action-thrillers. So you won't have trouble in pace, no proper developments, like the characters or the story, it only moves forward so quickly. I think the end was good, only if they are not planning for a sequel. But that part was not clear, so there's no surprise if they make another film.

He pretty much makes this movie which is a roller-coaster action ride. As with most of this type of action flicks the story and script is fairly mediocre. His old and not very trustworthy friend for example was not really adding any value and his actions was soooo predictable.\r\n\r\nThe thugs, although certainly projecting the required amount of “despicable bad-guy-ness”, were really nothing more than that. Stupid, stupid and more stupid. How they even manage to track John and Lydia down all the time is really beyond me.\r\n\r\nWith that said it was a enjoyable movie.

This time it revolves around a rock band who trapped in the neo-nazi enclosure on the outskirt of the city. So how do they plan to get away from the green room they're locked in, and armed men are outside waiting for them to take down. The film filled with lots of tense moments and mostly unpredictable stuffs which is a one day event.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised, I just expected something as smart as the director's previous film. He retained his favourite actor, Macon Blair to play an important role as their third collaboration in this multistarrer and he once again did well. This theme is not the first time explored, it is a well known, but the setting was very unique. All the actors were amazing, but truly very sad to hear the news about Anton Yelchin. He was a young and a wonderful actor and his '5 to 7' was my favourite.\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought the plot was so silly. I wondered why they did not use the excessive force as they're capable to tackle such situation. But that's the best part, because they threw away the cliché and approached for something new way to deal it. So the writer, I mean the director did great to carve a rare and thrilling film of the year.\r\n\r\nThere's no martial arts, criminal gang's collision or the cops fighting the bad guys; it was about how the normal people confront during a hostile situation in the real world.

        "content": "**Like a changing urban landscape, the humans as well!**\r\n\r\nWhen everybody around me liked the director's previous film 'A Touch of Sin', I didn't. As a film fanatic, reject such kind of film is not an easy job without giving a proper reason. I thought that was a missed opportunity. I surely like art films, not the boring one like those aimlessly narrated. I really loved some of the scenes there, but here it was completely different. Most importantly, anybody would understand what the film is trying to say without trying too hard.\r\n\r\nThis is a theme where the China's rise was revealed from the three people's personal life perspective that was categorised to the three generations or the timelines. That's not it, the communism was also highlighted, how it held back the people's freedom. The writer was really smart to smoothly disclosing that to the world. I mean the film never dragged the China's ruling party or its system, but all were told from its character who struggled and if you use your brain, you will get it why.\r\n\r\nThe narration was divided into three episodes. The first one takes place in the year 1999, in a small town somewhere in the China which is economically backward. The story follows a young woman named Tao, who is caught in a love triangle. But for the practical reason, she has to choose one of them and when she does, the other guy leaves the town with the heartbroken. This is the foundation, that dragged for nearly 40 minutes. Obviously slow, but very realistic approach.\r\n\r\nI grew up in the 90s, my country was not much different than what's in this film was shown. So I liked the atmosphere, all those the 90s set, the automobiles, lifestyle, the landscapes of the small towns et cetera taken me back to that time. But the thing is, it was China, society and culturally different. Anyway, it was past and what follows are totally flips the narration, including the perspective.\r\n\r\n> \"You know the hardest thing, about love is caring.\"\r\n\r\nThe second episode takes place in the year 2014, which is something like the present. It reveals what's the status of all the main three characters, like where they're economically standing and the personal life struggles. Tao's married life did not go well and her son is around ten years old who visits her from Shanghai. The one who left the town is now returned and battling for his life for some reason.\r\n\r\nIn the last 15 years, the China significantly changed and still, this entire part is set in the same town which is now economically moved forward. Like the changing urban landscape, how these characters too changed were what focused on this section.\r\n\r\nThen comes the final episode where it is now in the year 2025, that takes place somewhere in the Australia. The perspective was changed, the little boy is now in his 20s, seems lost is root. With his behaviour, you would notice that his lack of knowledge about his ancestors. He who has the differences with his father, decides to make his life as he wanted. That is why the parents should take responsibility to teach their children all the good things about their culture and traditions, and to carry on, it's up to them. Because losing one's identity could lead to the failures in the life.\r\n\r\nThis is the part I liked better. Because it was something like what I encountered in my life. Most of the childhood memories that returns after we're grown-up as the deja vu, like the history repeating itself. Here for pointing out the freedom one to buy a gun was indirectly hit the communism. I mean gun was not a threat, it was just an expressed how it affects people in all the similar circumstances. I meant, what something was hidden brings more eagerness for us to know about it than those are in the out. So forcing something on people is sometime is a bad idea.\r\n\r\nAll the actors were good, but apart from the slow screenplay, I liked the idea of this film. There are some other similar films, like how different generations behave and now this is among them, yet not the best out of all of them. Very much watchable, only if you are capable of handling slow drag. If you know this director very well or the fan of his works, you will find it a pretty interesting film. I won't recommend it, but I also won't either suggest you to skip it.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_"

        "content": "> Lost in one world, found in another.\r\n\r\nMy last anime movie was 'Giovanni Island' and I did not end up liking much. I thought that was a decent movie with an intense WWII story told through the Japanese children's perspective. Since then almost half a year passed and now I saw this from the director of 'Wolf Children'. That was his career best movie, so I think the director wanted to follow the same footstep. Thus he ended up making this one which was quite similar theme, except the sketches were not as cute as that.\r\n\r\nLike one of the discussion topics on this title, it almost connects with the director's previous movie. Maybe something like Tarantino, who tried to connect 'The Hateful Eight' with 'Django Unchained', later dropped the idea for the characters that failed to merge. But here the reason might be the drawings which were somewhat different styles. And this one seems for teenagers and adults for having a little mature content when the narration reaches the second half.\r\n\r\nIt opened by a brief telling about the monsters and its world. Came back to the human society to focus on a 8-year-old runaway boy named Ren. While tailing a couple of strange creatures, he accidentally enters the monster world through a secret portal. Soon he meets a beast called Kumatetsu who is one of two candidates for 'the great master' title, decides to take him as his protege.\r\n\r\nSo the quarrelling begins between them for having difference in everything, but as the time passes, they bond well. Then comes a time for Kumatetsu to compete in what he was preparing for, and the boy who finds his own path. But somewhere when they were getting apart, an evil force brings them together to fight against it.\r\n\r\n> \"People who work hard sincerely will master it quickly.\"\r\n\r\nFelt like I was watching a comedy, that was until the first half. All the character intros were kind of normal, nothing grand, but later found a strong connection to each other and each were very unique in nature to remember. This part is where that suits better for children and what comes next was kind of opposite. Feels fun parts are over, introduces a few new characters as the narration takes as big leap as 8 years forward.\r\n\r\nThis middle section was like a re-launch, like a new story to begin. As a child character turns into a teenager, the movie attempted to fit with adultish stuffs. So there was a semi romance, but feels like the quite friendship track. This is where you think the movie lets you down, a time kill section. Due to the theme that designed to take place between the two worlds, this is very important for moving forward to the 3rd act. I think shortening around 5 minutes would have done good for the pace of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe final act is even more unlike to the earlier episodes that adds a wonderful special effects to bring the action sequence. Sadly the stunts were not as dynamic as I hoped, I mean it was too short especially if you love fights. The kid and the beast combo were like from 'Ernest & Celestine'. Whenever these two are seen together, that bring so much fun.\r\n\r\nBasically the movie outlines how humans are obsessed for power, who can go any lengths to clinch it and one of the ways is to let the darkness consume him. I already saw it twice. For the second time view it was even better and I liked it very much. Still, it is not the director's best work, as well as not a bad movie to just ignore.\r\n\r\nAfter Miyazaki announced his retirement, many anime fans, including me were heartbroken. I never found anyone who can replace him, but a very few names came closer that includes this film director. He already gave some hits, but right now all he needs is to carry on his consistency, and definitely his name would appear beside that legend. I need not to tell you that anime movies are becoming rare these days, so when one make its way and people who watched it says it is a good movie, then must grab it.\r\n\r\n8½/10"

It’s THAT compelling. The movie contains interviews with every primary person linked to Robert 'Evel' Knievel, including associates, employees, relatives, reporters and those he inspired. It’s such a fascinating story of a flawed man who was obsessed with success and recognition to the point he regularly risked life and limb. \r\n\r\nFamily members point out that they lost Bobby Knievel to Evel Knieval as he conquered the world with his daredevilry and ensuing fame. To cope with the stress of regularly facing death and the ever-increasing pain of his multiple wounds he turned to alcohol, meds and loose sex. By the time of his Snake River Canyon jump he was so anxious he turned on the reporters, which was a bad move since they were the ground laborers that assisted his fame. After his 1977-78 conviction and six months prison sentence for assaulting the writer of his biography (which everyone involved said was accurate and, if anything, too tame), he lost most of his marketing endorsements and deals, including Harley-Davidson and Ideal Toys, which led to his bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nDespite his glaring downfall, the movie thankfully ends on a very positive note.          \r\n\r\nThe film runs 99 minutes.            \r\n \r\nGRADE: A+"

        "content": "Let’s face facts…it is inevitable that bad horror films and the new beginning of a movie season go together as systematically as skeleton bones to an unmarked grave. In either case, both scenarios are routinely realized and does not look to change at any time in the immediate future. Director William Brent Bell’s (‘The Devil Inside’) latest banal boofest **‘The Boy’** is basically business as usual in terms of registering as a flaccid fright fable pitted in the dumping ground of released duds in the relatively new year. In essence, ‘The Boy’ is one stillborn terrorizing tyke born out of artificial and tired creepy conventions.\r\n\r\nSure, **The Boy** has its share of atmospheric chills and, as a production, it exudes a tension-filled anxiousness courtesy of the polished Gothic-induced vibes in gives off in its sinister-looking set designs. Nevertheless, **The Boy** fails to hold our attention where it truly counts in structured, solid storytelling and viable psychological thrills. Instead, Bell’s pat knee-shaking narrative spends its time focusing on the familiar and flawed cliches involving meager melodramatic plot developments, recycled unnatural occurrences, the movie’s harried heroine and her beleaguered backstory and annoying jolts and tiresome false jump starts in manufactured suspense. Of course, ‘The Boy’s panic playground for its horrific happenings takes place in a spacious and darkened manor populated by eccentric occupants and their devoted, demonic doll (hence, ‘the boy’ in question).\r\n\r\nAmerican Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan, ‘The Walking Dead’) travels across the pond to start over in the quaint English countryside as she leaves behind the fragments of a bad relationship back the States. Greta looks to pursue a job opportunity as a nanny for the Heelshire couple (Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle) at their expansive estate. The Heelshires need Greta for tending to their son Brahms’s personal affairs. The unusual discovery from the newly hired nanny, however, is that Greta’s task is to watch Brahms, a porcelain doll and NOT a human little boy. The Heelshires, out of touch with reality, treats the inanimate tot as a real son. Nevertheless, a job is a job so Greta minds the toy tyke when his ‘parents’ decide to go away for the holiday.\r\n\r\nThankfully, Greta learns about the histrionics pertaining to the Heelshires and Brahms through their deliveryman Malcolm (Rupert Evans). The Heelshires’ disillusionment originated nearly two decades ago when the original and real-life Brahms died in a tragic fire. This, of course, reveals the questionable quirks about the boy’s maturing parents’ behavior and denial mode in substituting the doll conveniently for their belated and beloved son Brahms. Greta is determined to do right by the Heelshires and treat Brahms with the compassion they imaged her duties would entail. Importantly, Greta must make a good impression on the unassuming boy doll as the Heelshires warned that Brahms has had his troubles with past nannies.\r\n\r\nAt first Greta is pensive to react to Brahms and leaves him sitting idle in the corner. The Heelshires had given specific instructions on how to handle their precious “boy” as they have naturally spoiled him with amounts of attention.  Greta eventually finds the nerve to cater to Brahms’s every caretaking whims and soon expresses a fondness for him in the process. So far, so good, right?\r\n\r\n**The Boy** certainly has its moments of shock value but the sluggish story feels lukewarm for the most part. Bell and screenwriter Stacey Manear cobble together a mysterious and moody horror thriller that is somewhat old-fashioned as it relies on tension-building tactics involving shadowy hallways, dim-light rooms and innuendo scares that suggest more meat to the bone when spotlighting everything from Brahms’s aura of the present to the deceased Brahms’s existence of the past. Both Bell and Manear arm **The Boy’s** leading lady Cohan/Greta with personal issues meant to carry over to the English landscape but the malaise she possesses comes off as matter-of-factly. And who really did not telegraph Greta’s ex-main squeeze Cole showing up in England to claim his woman’s heart only to meet some static concerning the clingy Brahms?\r\n\r\nIt is such a shame that The Boy could not capitalize any further on its strange and hypnotic inclinations. After all, this off-kilter narrative had the makings for a psychological masking of paranoia and possessiveness but never quite taps into the underscored hedonistic hold that exists between Greta and toyish tot Brahms or Brahms and the salacious spells of the manor where his dubious presence exists. Sadly, the slow burn effectiveness of The Boy stutters especially when revisiting the titillating genre of disturbing dolls and the mayhem they spin towards their hapless human counterparts (yeah, at least **Chucky** and **Magic’s** dummy Fats had some genuine gory gumption to bring to the terrifying table).\r\n\r\nWhat is maddening about **The Boy** is the wasted potential of what perhaps could have been a whacked-out gem that exploited the surreal circumstances of mental and emotional loss and elusive reality. Instead, the intended suspense is as solitary and stiff as the bratty Brahms’s compact body.\r\n\r\n**The Boy** (2016)\r\n\r\n1 hr. 37 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Lauren Cohan, Rupert Evans, Diana Hardcastle, James Russell, Jim Norton\r\n\r\nDirected by: William Brent Bell\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror/Thriller\r\n\r\nCritic’s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2016"

It feels like watching a classic horror film, especially because of the English atmosphere and the house where it was shot. A young American woman named Greta, takes up a nanny job in England to escape from the troubled relationship with her boyfriend. She discovers the boy she has to look out is a doll and later she observes a series of strange events that leads her to find out the truth. The dark secret comes out and that's the film.\r\n\r\nA limited cast film. The suspense was the key to the story narrating successfully. So I expected a big twist at the end, but it was a decent one and the overall film was just above average. The atmosphere was creepy, and then it weakened as the development was decelerated going to the second and the final act. Until the twist, it was good and after that a bit disappointing. Not because of the bad conclusion, but comparing it with the rest, especially after the anticipation it created in us, that end part looked so small and simple. Good film to watch for once, but like the most of the horror films, it's fallen short to get my thumbs up.\r\n\r\n6/10"

How wrong was I.\r\nAfter watching this movie I asked my partner what would she do in the females position of having to look after the porcelain Momma’s boy, she replied “shave him and put lipstick on him” - I found this response better than watching the entire movie. I don’t recall one part of this film which I sat an thoroughly enjoyed. So if he had been shaved and made up, maybe then I would have had that slight bit of entertainment.\r\n\r\nSo we start off and the obviously attractive babysitter girl rocks up at obviously isolated house and an obviously good looking guy is there to greet here, what a fucking groundbreaking start! She walks into the strangers house even though they haven’t even came down to greet her which in my opinion is just damned bad manners so I’m already sat hoping potfingers fucks her up a bit for being so stereotypical. \r\n\r\nThe couple she’s working for come downstairs and lo and behold as if the title didn’t give it away, it’s not a child……….it’s a fucking doll. I have to say as well the creepy doll bears resemblance to an 8 year old peadophile. She gets a set of rules which you can see her already disregarding inside her head as she’s taught how to put a doll in PJs and tuck it up for the night, at this point I would have been ordering Dominos and a truck tonne of movies on the sly for the easy time ahead. \r\nThere’s an attic. As if this movie couldn’t be anymore fucking original - we now have a mysterious attic where the audience is supposed to wonder what happens beyond the ladder! I did not, I wondered when is this going to end as I can feel my mind thinking about going back to the Indian takeaway I’ve left downstairs for morning.  I mean she ends up going to explore the attic NAKED, as if I couldn’t be more frustrated at how unoriginal this is, like a lot of other current horrors it has quickly gone down the road to try and make you focus on the potential tits rather than how fucking bored you are by the plot.\r\nI’d wrote a decent amount of things to comment on for after the film but truth be told - all I can say to truly summarise it would be Hollywood horror. The jumps are cheap, the twists are obvious and Brahms (child) just turns into more of a pervert as the movie progresses. If the girl was feeling that fucked up by what was happening surely you’d just get a heavy object and smash his porcelain face in? Well, being quicker about doing this anyways. (OOPS spoiler alert, but if you hadn’t seen that coming then I’m going to guess you’re someone who watched this and thought it was pure golden). \r\n\r\nIf you ask me, all Brahms wanted was a bit of action judging by him acting like a randy teenager during the movie, even encased in a pot shell there was no stopping the lad from trying to scope her in the shower. Gotta give it to him for that I guess.\r\n\r\nTerrible. Avoid. Stay clear.\r\n2/10"

What goes wrong when they just want to play with it, but it's forbidden by their strict father is the rest of the story.\r\n\r\nIt is a weakest writing for a movie that borrowed an idea from the others. Failed to capitalise and falls into an average list. There is no particular performance to point out, but Kiernan Shipka is who had more screenspace and was decent with her show.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing much to talk about the movie, the dialogues were very rare and too short. A simple drama, mostly boring for its uninteresting under developed scenes. Surely a watchable movie, but does it worth spending your time? I don't think so, thankfully it was not the worst film I've ever seen.\r\n\r\n6/10"

Life on earth is meant for survival of the fittest, but the human evolution changed that idea and again, what happen when the rules we are used to have changed back to the original? This is a post apocalyptic theme set in somewhere in the Britain and revolves around three people who are fighting for their survival, everyday.\r\n\r\nThe feature film debut for the director, who also managed the screenplay quite superbly. You can find many similar films, but everyone of those has its own story with the backdrop of various threats and other issues to deal. Also, when the circumstances differ, the following events take a different lead. Thus giving the viewers a new perspective and entertainment.\r\n\r\nThis is nothing like those I had seen. It was too rough and tough in revealing stuffs to the facts of its state of condition. I mean the humans have lost the trust between one another. You might say that is common in all the post-apocalyptic films, but this is very good at details. A silent film, like background score was almost zero, so the appeal was stronger in every those thrill scenes like it was real or some kind of a documentary film.\r\n\r\nA man is living alone in the middle of the forest, grows his own vegetables and always be an extra careful from any outside threat. Then one day a woman and her daughter comes looking for food to trade with their valuables. The deal does not go well between them, but somehow they all manage to gain trust and start to live together. Obviously there's always an issue of food shortage, so how they are going to handle and followed by many other troubles brings an end to the tale.\r\n\r\n> \"The only thing I have caught in there walked on two legs.\"\r\n\r\nA minimal cast film with less dialogues, but totally a visual storyteller. I liked the film, but not my favourite, just a fine thriller. The actors are not very popular, but still they are familiar faces and I liked the film because of them. Critically acclaimed and well received by movie goers, but the common people who are vital for the commercial success let it down. It was nominated for the BAFTA awards in the newcomer writer/director category, but did not win.\r\n\r\nThe film's main plot is the food. The human population grown so fast during entering the twenty first century and again fallen rapidly due to the shortage of food which is obviously directly affected by pollution and other issues. So the theme was right, but not everybody gets that message. Because most of who watch it expects entertainment and nothing else. I hope that would not be your excuse to ignore it.\r\n\r\nThe film was shot in Northern Ireland, in a couple of places and its surroundings. It is slow, but steady in what it wanted to tell us. It's not a question about how familiar the theme is, but how different and obviously how different people tackle such situations is what this film focused to tell us pretty dramatic way. \r\n\r\nWhen I say the poster, I thought it was like a native American or south American's story. Mainly because of the haircut that gave the impression like that I saw from other films. The synopsis gave a different perspective, so I found it more interesting than before. Then I watched, with a low expectation after knowing it was not received well. But I surprised and come to know this is not a bad film as they have said. In fact a very interesting perspective on how these three people struggle with what they have got in front of them. I am not saying it's a must see, but definitely not the worst, so I suggest you to do small research if you are confused to try this title. If you ask me, I would say just go for it.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

Initially I did not like much, it looked like another same old themed teen film. But the second half of the film completely changed, especially about bullying and how others see it, apart from the victim and offender. An awareness film, though the end drawn as what a cinematic storytelling required than the social message.\r\n\r\nThe kids did well, particularly Jack, Ben and a few others. There's no obscene materials, but in a sequence it gets bold like how normal teenagers are obsessed with those stuffs. That does not mean it is bad for them to watch. It is a much better film on this theme, and gets better while progressing narration. It is one of the under noticed good film of the year. It's not a must see, yet worth giving it a try.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

The story works but it is not really anything special and some of the stuff, like the loyalty centers, was frankly a bit silly. But, as I wrote, it works and does not get in the way so that’s good enough for me.\r\n\r\nAs the previously mentioned nerd and geek I absolutely loved the abundant references to science fiction, fantasy and gaming history and lore. For me those were soo cool. I will probably watch the movie again just to focus on the background and see how much stuff I can spot. Stuff that I missed when watching the movie the first time.\r\n\r\nThe CGI effects and the action was also pretty awesome. The movie starts off right away with a great and absolutely insanely wild car race and continues to go strong from there. The battle at Doom castle at the end is just epic.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that made me go WTF was at the end [SPOILER AHEAD] were Mr Asswipe Sorrento finally catches up with the High Five’s van and the he just freezes and looks at Wade with a silly look on his face. What the fuck was that? Just stupid for no good reason.\r\n\r\nWell, few are the movies where there’s nothing to gripe about. On the whole though this movie was great in my book. Also, I cannot say how pleased I am to finally watch a Hollywood movie that is not a remake or a sequel or a prequel or some other lame excuse to rehash a movie that has already been made."

After the creator dies, he challenges all users to go on a hunt for an Easter egg which gives them control over the OASIS.\r\n\r\n'Ready Player One' isn’t a movie you’d expect from a 71 year old filmmaker but Spielberg once again shows his range. It's an incredibly fun ride that’ll have you cracking up more than once (“It’s f***ing Chucky!”).\r\n\r\nWhile Spielberg switches seamlessly between real life and the virtual reality it’s rather difficult to get emotionally invested in the movie. Nonetheless most characters are fun and the love story between Parzival/Wade and Art3mis/Samantha gives it some depth.\r\nBen Mendelsohn is delightful as the villain and Mark Rylance is excellent once again.\r\n\r\nThe biggest treat of course is the nostalgia. You’ll have a blast simply by counting the pop culture references(Iron Giant’s thumbs up and the Shining among my personal favorites). The movie features a killer 80’s soundtrack and Alan Silvestri provides the finishing touch with a wonderful score.\r\n\r\nReady Player One is a visual feast.

Which while hardly being a film that deserved a theatrical run - or indeed a must see horror - is still a shame because it's a very tidy little chiller.\r\n\r\nMood is nicely set by the opening where a young Shree Crooks (Stephanie) goes about her daily life alone in the house - her only companion a cuddly toy turtle.

Shadows and supernatural incidents compound the \"child in dread\" vibe, while an observation of articles in the house hint at what has brought the young girl to her situation.\r\n\r\nOnce the parents arrive on the scene we get further strange occurrences and strange motifs, little hints as to what has happened. Director Akiva Goldsman does a fine job on what is obviously a limited budget, managing to create some quality horror sequences whilst maintaining suspense in a three character piece.\r\n\r\nThere's a loose end or two that is intriguing but annoyingly so, and a sense of frustration with the resolution has proved to be a divisive topic (isn't it nearly always the case in horror anyway?). However, this is well worth a watch for the horror mystery fan whose prepared to accept it on its own \"keeping the wheel\" turning terms. 6.5/10"

It is not an event based action-comedy or something like man meets woman romance-comedy, but very random presentation. Where it begins and where it ends, you can't clearly say it is a well written script. The actings were decent, but the scenes aren't overwhelmingly impressive as it should be. Directed by 'Neon Flesh' famed filmmaker, after that film his other projects weren't up to the standards including this one.\r\n\r\nIt is written by the one who was behind the 'American Ultra'. There's a strikingly similar between these two and you won't deny if you had seen them. Especially Anna Kendrick's character to what the Jesse Eisenberg was in that film. If we go deep, Sam Rockwell as well might fall into the same category to what Kristen Stewart was. At some point, one of the film characters mentions the same secret project. So I think it is the same universe and a spin-off.\r\n\r\nSam-Kendrick combo was the highlight of the film. I hope they would do some serious subject together in the near future. The action sequences were good, other than that it's not funny at all or romantic. That means I did not enjoy it because the theme did not work for me which I felt very common these days. So it failed because of the lack of innovation and proper development, but the overall film was not bad if entertainment is the main agenda. I know there are audience for it and they will back it. I won't stand between you and your watch if you want to try it, I just say be careful, that's all.\r\n\r\n5/10"

We’ve seen the concept before (think “True Romance” meets “Grosse Point Blank“), but the idea has never been as messy, sloppy and as ill conceived as it is here.\r\n\r\nUnlucky in love Martha (Anna Kendrick) has her world turned upside down when she meets and falls for gun for hire Francis (Sam Rockwell). Their love story blossoms over killings, knives and gun battles. The script, written by Max Landis of “American Ultra” fame, is just too flimsy to work. I expected more from the writer.\r\n\r\nTim Roth and RZA turn in enjoyable supporting performances, but the two leads lend the most starpower. The film features the onscreen pairing of my dreams with Kendrick and Rockwell. The two have an undeniable chemistry, but both actors are completely wasted with this mess. I really, really hope to see them work together in the future in a good movie — they both deserve a far better vehicle than this.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Right” is a fun idea that’s poorly executed.\r\n\r\nMATT SAYS:\r\n\r\nIn “Mr. Right,” Martha (Anna Kendrick) has recently broken up with her boyfriend after she discovers him cheating on her. A chance encounter in a convenience store leads her to start dating an unnamed hitman (Sam Rockwell).\r\n\r\nIf those two names — Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick — are all you need to hear to decide you want to see this movie, read no further. If you want to see the two of them play off of one another, this will be a meal that is mostly satisfying for you, but leaves you just a little bit hungry for something with more substance. There are probably vehicles that would have worked better for the two of them, but basically, it’s enjoyable enough as a choice for a movie night at home.\r\n\r\nThe highlights: Sam Rockwell’s dancing and dry delivery and the way that Anna Kendrick’s millennial-angsty, world-weary-but-optimistic character plays off of him. Tim Roth’s nameless soldier-of-fortune with inscrutable motivations. The rent-a-thug Steve (The RZA), who is nothing if not pragmatic. The lowlights: a terrible script that tries too hard to shoehorn a hardcore action plot into a film that works well enough without it. It’s readily apparent why this movie didn’t get a wider theatrical release.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed seeing it, but ask me a month from now and I’ll barely remember it.\r\n\r\n**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**"

Sam Rockwell has a very particular style of acting to begin with, and telling him to turn it up to eleven turns out amazingly.  Anna Kendrick, better know for \"I'm a teen girl\" acting than intense action roles keeps every pace with Rockwell in both action and madness.\r\n\r\nWhile we get whiplash from how likeable Kendrick's character is before Rockwell comes in, the fun of the movie quickly takes off in both action and writing.  As \"Mr. Right\" carries chaos in his wake, it starts to develop multi-threading between the two characters, and while Rockwell is the main focus for majority of the movie, I think it is equal part leads between the two.\r\n\r\nThere is some funny business in the 3rd act as they do some things that would normally be 1st act establishing events, but one becomes a mini-arc of the 3rd act, and the other just isn't explained at all, unless I misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe only other movie that is even close to this is \"Wanted\", and that's pretty superficial, the higher philosophical points aren't presented in the same manner at all, the movies \"feel\" completely differently, but they both focus on the morality of killing and high reflexes.\r\n\r\nDefinitely give this one a go if you like action movies, it's a lot of fun."

It starts with an original idea: a hit man undergoes a personality change due to an injury, so that instead of carrying out hit jobs like previously, he decides that “murder is wrong “ and so, not seeing the obvious irony, he kills those who order the hits.\r\n\r\nWe also meet Martha, a single gal coming off a bad break-up (isn’t everyone at the start of these movies?) and the two of them gradually make a connection. Against all odds, it seems, given his mental state, he treats her quite well. Their banter is witty and intelligent, with some humor coming from him telling her exactly what he does — kill people — and she naturally thinks he is kidding. She has her own surprises for us later, but I will give nothing away here.\r\n\r\nAs I have noticed with a few other movies lately — mostly action films, such as Nobody — there is a ridiculous amount of violence here, almost cartoonish at times. I invented a new genre for them :Bodybag movies. I guess if some viewers require such excesses, who am I to complain? I enjoyed this movie anyway. I like that he is always polite and considerate to his new girlfriend even under extreme and dangerous situations. And you know how it is neat when characters display personal growth? The surprises that emerge concerning Martha that I alluded to above are part of a rather astonishing bit of character growth for her. Or is ‘growth’ the wrong word?. But no, my lips are sealed. Watch this entertaining comedy and see for yourself."

        "content": "> Man always solely wanted to dominate the world and its other species.\r\n\r\nAs far I remember I've not seen any Chinese or the Hong Kong movies in the past 12 months. So I have heard about this film a lot that it was the China's highest domestic gross movie ever. Since then I have marked it to check it out as much soon as possible and after the watching with a high expectation I'm here right away. I've been watching movies since my childhood, but it became serious after the 'The Two Towers'. So first I'm a fantasy film fan before becoming neutral. But still sometimes I'm very keen on them like I was for this one.\r\n\r\nIn the present era, we've zombies, superheroes, vampires, werewolves, aliens, robots, so on varieties for making a good entertaining flick. But just half a millennium ago when there was no motion-picture, but literature and the stage play, there were only good vs bad, god vs devil, man vs monster and beasts. So the modern creations were sci-fi and the old ones are fantasies. After CGI is becoming very flexible, the filmmakers are on the race to get on-board into one of those genre franchises. So nowadays we are witnessing head-to-head contest between these two genres, but a great treat for the movie fanatics like me.\r\n\r\nThe first impression was the film's posters which were done similar to the traditional Chinese paintings. Second, the decent trailer, I was displeased with the CGI characters in the clips, but watching them in the full flow movie it looked so much better. One of the best visually stunning Mandarin movies. Despite setting a record at the box office, the budget was doubled after the drug controversy over the original lead actor who was later replaced by another and re-shot his portions entirely including special effect were redone.\r\n\r\n> \"Monsters are the most cunning creatures in the world.\r\n> They hide in human skin, dress as human and speak human language!\"\r\n\r\nThe director had a handful experience from working on some Hollywood projects. Literally, it was his first solo, also the first live-shot directional debut movie and he nailed it. Very disappointing when it comes to the story, because it was just a one-liner which is well known since the inception of motion-picture. Set in the ancient period China when the humans and monsters lived together and later went to the war to dominate each other. Drawn a border between the two worlds that brought peace for the centuries until one day some kind of coup happened in the monsters' side. So the confrontation restores after a few monsters hops on the other side with human. How it all will be solved is the remaining action, adventure with lots of fun.\r\n\r\nQuite similar to current European migrant crises. People who flee from the civil war in the middle-east is not welcomed by the few locals which led to some violence in the refugee camps. In this movie as well, without realising they brought the same environmental situation between man and monster.\r\n\r\nOf course it is a children-cum-adult movie, but killing the cute monsters and cooking them, all of them are kind of gave me a sceptical feeling. Besides, it had romance as a sub-plot and Baihe Bai was so cute. Usually movies from this part of the Earth reminds martial arts. Since the director worked in 'Shrek' films, easily noticeable that some contents influenced from the other industries as well. The human skin thing reminded me the MIB and the song Indian films. The comedies are the uplift along the exciting stunts which fought among the live and CGI characters.\r\n\r\nThere are some thing that does not make sense, but in fantasy films those are logical that we can't consider as a flaw. But explanation needs, especially the inspired mythical story from another culture and that is where it quite failed. Overall movie passes the entertainment and quality test, but it is more a family movie and less a youngster's. Definitely a sequel is on the card after the tremendous success, if they fail to bring another movie, it will be their loss. For the foreign audience, especially the western world, it might be an average or an okay movie because of quite familiar with this kind of theme. Anyway, I recommend it for those who enjoy comedy-fantasy films.\r\n\r\n7½/10"

So the billionaire Grey and Ana's erotic adventure sustains. With the small-small developments the film goes all the way to the ending. That means, those who are watching it for the selected scenes, will surely would have a nice time. But nothing was strong as any European film on the similar theme.\r\n\r\nApart from the weak storyline, there's nothing wrong with it. As to what this film is about, it served better. That's what I say to you not to expect full storied romance-drama. As usual the actors were good and another two films to come in the 'Fifty Shades' franchise. I hope they can be better than the first two. Overall, it is only for the selected audience, but curiosity makes everybody watch it and they all pour they perspective which is flooded with average to negative. Otherwise, it is an acceptable film.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"

He is fortunate, the remainder of the inmates are little better treated than vermin. They have no rights and the doctrine is straightforward - obey or perish. None has a name, merely a number and so \"83\" decides to mobilise the restless prisoners and overthrow this hellish system that enthrals them. Even when he receives news that he has been pardoned, and is to be released, he determines to see his task through. It's about as subtle as an air raid - we are all rooting for the prisoners (regardless of the crimes committed to put them there) and no effort is made by director Walter Forde to temper that one-sidedness. That robs it of much intellectual potency and so it just becomes a cunning plot to escape film and though not bad, is a tad on the earnest side at times. Still, Veidt is decent enough as is Noah Beery (\"Mooche\"), and though nothing at all new (even then) occurs, it's still just about worth 80 minutes."

        "content": "Kaaval begins with a voice-over reeling out the numbers of murders that have happened in the state and the cases that have not been unsolved so. Then, we are told that most of these killings were done by contract killers, who do them solely for money. And we are given the man who is responsible for these dirty jobs — Karuna, a gangster in a fishing hamlet, who has everyone from ministers to cops in his pocket and runs a business that spans drug peddling, intimidation, contract killing, et al out in the open.\r\n\r\nBut one man is plotting his downfall — a cop, an encounter specialist, to be specific. This is Chandrasekar (Samuthirakani), who is determined to end Karuna once and for all and goes undercover and observes the gangster's day-to-day activities. He gets the go-ahead to carry out an encounter but the plan goes kaput because Anbarasu aka Anbu (Vemal), the carefree son of a police constable (MS Bhaskar), who is on friendly terms with Karuna, informs the gangster of the operation. Chandrasekar's fellow cop is murdered and this only makes him all the more eager to kill Karuna. A turn of events result in Karuna beginning to suspect Anbu and now, the young man is hunted by both cop and criminal.\r\n\r\nThe problem with Kaaval is that it offers nothing new in terms of story and presentation. Almost every development feels been there done that. The story of an encounter specialist is something that Gautham Menon did with much finesse in Kaakha Kaakha, and this film hardly adds anything to it. Interestingly, the director ropes in Gautham to provide the voice-over in the opening scenes. The villain is the generic gangster that we often see in our films and so, he hardly comes across as a formidable foe. Then, there is the heroine character, who simply exists because there needs to be a love interest for the hero.\r\n\r\nThen there are the twists which we can see a mile away. The tries to keep Chandrasekar's identity a mystery until the halfway mark but we know he is a cop in his very first scene. Similarly, we are shown a cop getting marriage and we realize instantly that he will be murdered a few scenes later. Such predictability pulls down the film every time something remotely interesting happens.\r\n\r\nThankfully, the editor seems to have realized this and makes the scenes zip through, never allowing us to pause for breath and ponder over the flaws. It also helps that in Samuthirakani, the film has someone who can carry it to the end, with a sincere performance that is very typical of the actor.\r\n\r\nThe decision to make the hero an unwitting pawn of sorts is interesting and Anbu isn't exactly a character whom we root for. He is a good-for-nothing, who is clearly influenced by the corrupt practices of his constable father, and uses the cop's son as a get-away-with-anything card. And he doesn't have a shred of remorse in taking the gangster's side even though he is well aware of his nefarious activities. And once Chandrasekar enters the picture, he sorts of recedes into the background, but Vemal plays this character, which has a few shades, too casually to get us interested in Anbu."

        "content": "The year is 1979 and Dorothea Fields finds herself in her 50s raising a teenage boy, Jaime, while running a house in Santa Barbara that is always going through renovations. Jaime’s father is not in the picture but who needs a father when your mother rents rooms to a handful of particular individuals ranging from different generations.  Director Mike Mills casts three powerful actresses, Annette Bening, Greta Gerwig and Elle Fanning, to fill the roles of the different women in Jaime’s life and they help create three compelling female characters that pulls you in. The problem? These three exceptional characters are subsided for a coming-of-age narrative that fails to compare to the women that help raised it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Set in Santa Barbara, the film follows Dorothea Fields (Annette Bening), a determined single mother in her mid-50s who is raising her adolescent son, Jamie (newcomer Lucas Jade Zumann, in a breakout performance) at a moment brimming with cultural change and rebellion. Dorothea enlists the help of two younger women in Jamie's upbringing - via Abbie (Greta Gerwig), a free-spirited punk artist living as a boarder in the Fields' home, and Julie (Elle Fanning), a savvy and provocative teenage neighbor.\r\n\r\nBeing a single parent is tough, it is even tougher when your son is a teenager dealing with romances, the freeing energy of punk music and playing games which entails panting real hard while someone pulls on their diaphragm. After a trip to the hospital, Annette Bening’s Dorothea realizes she might not be able to raise her son by herself and requests the aide of the different women in Jaime’s life. Dorothea does not need help with the physical needs of raising a child in providing shelter and nutrition but the psychological needs of raising in a child in providing the knowledge about life, women and what it means to be a man. Each female was born in a different generation and dealing with their own issues that life has handed them and this leads to Jaime becoming that much more confused about life.\r\n\r\nAnnette Bening is absolutely fantastic as Dorothea and you grow a connection with her because Dorothea isn’t developed as a motherly character but as a human. It isn’t all Dorothea’s fault as she was raised during the Depression as Jaime loves to points out. She put a barrier around her and her son when his father left and this is shown through her moments of conservatisms despite being a free spirit of sorts. She tasks these females with a job that she should be doing but that doesn’t mean she is taking a step from the spotlight. She joins them to a trip to a punk rock club so she could not only understand her son but these females as well.\r\n\r\nThe first to tackle the challenge of raising Jaime is Greta Gerwig’s Abbie who is influenced by feminism, punk music and photography. Abbie uses the first two influences to help guide Jaime into an understanding of what it means to be a man. As titles such as Our Bodies, Our Selves and Sisterhood is Powerful find a way onto Jaime’s lap and words such as clitoris stimulation and menstruating find a way into Jaime’s ears, Abbie’s attempts to help Jaime define what a man is by allowing herself define herself through a the perceptive of past males in her life.\r\n\r\nThis is a trend that could be found in all three women as Ellie Fanning’s Julie uses her promiscuity to rebel against her therapist mother and the world. Ellie, who is closest to Jaime’s age, is the last one to tackle the task given to her and if she wasn’t already sneaking into Jaime’s bed every night, she probably would have avoided the task altogether. Jaime yearns for Ellie and she informs him that he just wants the idea of her. Jaime is confused, after all he is a teenage boy, and all the hormones and feminist literature is not helping.\r\n\r\nThe definition of what a man and woman is changes every generation. My great grandfather would tell me that a man buys a woman flowers, write her love letters and a bunch of other things males in 2016 no longer consider tasks a man does. Three different females are attempting to define these terms through the scope of their generation and how their generation saw it and unfortunately, majority of those definitions are no longer validated for Jaime’s generation.\r\n\r\n20th Century Women takes things one step further and gives us backstories and what is to come of everyone living within the house. There is no real problem with this except for the fact that these backstories don't offer any real reflection which adds to the frustration that the film does not have an arc, well not one I could point out. At one point, I thought the film was concluding as we learn what is to come of Dorothea early on. I was later surprised that there was still an hour left within the film. Dabbled with nostalgia, 20th Century Women would have made for a better coming-of-age if the film decided to follow our titular women than just a boy that connected the three together."

        "content": "**Rather a 20th century tale!**\r\n\r\nYou have seen films like this often. This is where a chick film meets art. Art means not the flick full of inspiration, message, awareness. But the presentation was so pleasant. The screenplay carefully picked the right events, and the dialogues were good. The book fanatics would go and look for the original source it was adapted from. But the truth is it was an originally written screenplay, and that's why it got a nomination at the recent Oscars. Another way to say, it inspired by the director's own childhood life, being raised by his mother and sister.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a single mother, whose teenage son is struggling to blend with the world. Then they have two roommates, one a woman in her 20s and a middle aged man. Beside a girl of her son's age visits regularly and sometimes secretly. So how all these people influence in the boy's life is the story that revealed. His mother being from different generation and not understanding the present world, which was the year 1979, where the film sets in.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Beginners', yet another unique film. Thematically there's nothing special, though it was carved with the excellent bunch of actors made the difference. I'm not sure the title was perfect for what the film narrated. Yes, if it was Annette Bening's Dorothea's story, then it justifies. But the story does not have one perspective of narration. All the main characters like Bening, Elle, Greta, Crudup and Zumann, shared screen equally. So, instead I would have preferred the title, '20th Century Tale'.\r\n\r\nGreta kind of reminded me Kristen Stewart with the hair like that. Two hours long drama with some funs. Really a good film. The topics it brings in for discussion were interesting, especially which is in the current era. Films like this should be watching. It is about the life, people with different characters and ambitions.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

        "content": "Although a simplistic and familiar theme is explored involving sinister forces tormenting a child in distress, Swedish director David F. Sandberg brings something chillingly fresh to his horror/psychological offering **Lights Out**.  Sandberg, making his feature film debut, delivers an adequate amount of tension and trickery for all things considered ominous in the edginess of darkness. Lights Out is a reasonable chiller that demonstrates a decent measurement of depth without tripping over its cliched feet. The characterizations that go “bump in the night” in **Lights** are not as disposable as one is routinely used to experiencing in produced over-indulgent, generic boofests.\r\n\r\nThe construction of **Lights Out** feels atmospheric and sparse at times but the manufactured thrills somehow add the necessary alarm factor in a psychological thriller that boasts solid performances particularly by actress Maria Bello as the tortured soul at the center of the CGI creepiness. Sandberg’s adventurous direction and screenwriter Eric Heisserer’s spell-binding script works in part because Lights Out never extends itself beyond its lean and claustrophobic confines. The storytelling is taut and the scare tactics create worthy jolts without further monotony.  There are predictable jumpy cuts and the movie never fully deviates from the conventional suspenseful landscape that populates countless fright fables. Still, **Lights Out** manages to shine some shady brightness on this effectively drawn hair-raising spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe premise introduces the long-lasting notion of childhood fear and despair on the jeopardized shoulders of young insomniac Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) who has long since left the haunting homestead where the evil vibes of a dastardly spirit had tortured her relentlessly.  Rebecca is now concerned that the tawdry tradition of this shifty spook is now about to terrify her little 10-year old stepbrother Martin (Gabriel Bateman). In fact, Martin wants to split his hellish household and escape to Rebecca’s place for some guaranteed safety. After all, who can blame the poor kid for wanting to abandon his doomed domicile.\r\n\r\nEnter the problematic Sophie (Bello). As the nervous-wreck mother to both Rebecca and Martin, Sophie has had her share of disappointments, heartaches and breakdowns in the past and present. It was revealed that Sophie had spent some critical time in a mental institution many years ago which explains her current complicated issues with men/relationships not to mention the strained connection with her disillusioned children. More important, Sophie faces the dilemma of encountering an assortment of deceased figures that randomly pop up from time to time within her expansive, worrisome walls. But nothing is more arousing or concerning than Sophie’s run-ins with the devilish Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey), her troubled off-the-wall pal and fellow asylum inmate from yesteryear.\r\n\r\nWhat is so jittery about Diana’s presence in the house is that she is so clingy and protective of her precious Sophie. The key to Diana’s horrifying existence is when the lights are turned off, Thus, it allows the deranged feminine entity to roam the house in a blanket of blackness while staking the beleaguered Sophie in the process.\r\n\r\n**Lights Out** (originally Sandberg’s short film competition entry years ago) acts as a symbolic mirror reflecting the echoes of mental illness and inherent self-destruction concerning the fragile psyche. The film percolates convincingly when Bello’s Sophie is scarred constantly by the harried ties that bind. Sandberg demonstrates a wounded woman on the edge of insanity. The suffering of inner conflict and outer self-doubt has consumed Sophie to the point where she has personalized her self-inflicted poison with baggage ranging from a couple of deceased husbands to the harsh reality that her children are weary of her toxic nuttiness. Bello displays the brokenness and confusion of her portrayal with applauded conviction. The sister-brother tandem of Palmer’s Rebecca and Bateman’s Martin is both comforting and intriguing as they are joined at the hip in their fright night delusions. Vela-Bailey’s Diana is deliciously shadowy as the intrusive Diana applying the statically gloom.\r\n\r\nThe nightmarish special effects are challenging and imaginative and cinematographer Marc Spicer’s experimental lighting gives **Lights Out** its gripping sheen. Overall, Sandberg’s menacing mechanism of a movie certainly forces the shaky hand of its skeptical audience to snuggle up to the nearest light switch.\r\n\r\n**Lights Out** (2016)\r\n\r\nRat-Pac Tune Entertainment\r\n\r\n1 hr, 21 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Maria Bello, Teresa Palmer, Gabriel Bateman, Billy Burke, Alicia Vela-Bailey, Alexander DiPersia\r\n\r\nDirected by: David F.

Yes, there are like Ice Cube in the film, but the whole narration was presented from the Charlie's viewpoint. This story needed strong voice, but he had none.

Because some of the staffs were fired from the job, the students' misconduct peaked, it's totally a messy day. The English teacher, Campbell, gets into a fight for going against his co-staff. So the day goes on as the countdown begins for their most anticipated fight at the final bell of the school. The preparation for that and all other craziness take place before the finale.\r\n\r\nWhen the film started, it was like any other B movie, very familiar atmosphere and predictable. Once the second half kick-started, I felt it was getting better. And the climax was even better. So, it ended strongly, after a so-so opening. Till that end, I did not think it deserved a decent respect, but at the end a better one. With this kind of cast and thematic, the film was much better. Really a well made, nothing more than on the entertainment perspective. So, if that's your sole purpose to watch a film, then this is the right one. Go for it. A much better film than the rating it had received. #TeachersFight\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

Not all the flicks clicks, but different than what we usually get from other production houses. So that's how I ended up watching it and its an appreciable effort, but the film was average. Although the end scene was really good, I mean that homeless person part.\r\n\r\nThe film is about an infamous greeting card writer and tells how his professional life stumbles upon. While trying to make a comeback, he has to face a couple of trouble, including his unexpected romance and to keep up the promise he had made to a rich guy. Till the final scene they kept the momentums surrounding them both. So it feels like an intentional drag, since the whole film depended on those things and nothing else.\r\n\r\nWorth watching for Bob Odenkirk. The rest of the cast was not bad. Whatever the concept is, like, about a writer, kind of poet, but it avoids to exposing us the character how great he's with his work. So this is not a film with full details and should be watched without any expectation, or else better not think to pick it.\r\n\r\n_5/10_"

It's all about the young and attractive dancer \"David\" (Jonny Labey) who is secretly having an affair with his brother-in-law \"Jules\" (Daniel Brocklebank). It's a bit tempestuous and after a row, the younger man seeks comfort in the arms of \"Sam\" (Craig Stein) but that just causes even more ructions and you can now see just what's going to happen, and anticipate the fall out that is looming large for all concerned. So much more could have been done to develop the characters; the sex scenes are ridiculously sterile and there is just way too much petulant dialogue making the whole thing feel much longer than just ninety minutes.

Principal photography of the movie started in August 2015 in Los Angeles. The film is financed by Octane which is a division of the larger IM Global production house. Stuart Ford, its CEO serves as the movie’s executive producer. Open Road is distributing the movie in the United States. It is interesting to note that Open Road also distributed Wayan’s 2013 parody “A haunted house 1” and its 2014 sequel “A haunted house 2”, both of which belong to the same genre as this movie. \r\n\r\nMarlon Wayans stars as the mysterious Mr. Black in this outrageous comedy movie. He is also one of the producers and is credited as a writer alongside his long-time producing and writing partner Rick Alvarez. Mike Tiddes who directed both the haunted house parodies is the director of this movie. Kali Hawk, Mike Epps, Affion Crockett, Andrew Bachelor, Jane Seymour, Florence Henderson, Fred Willard and Jenny Zigrino appear in this movie along with Marlon Wayans.\r\n\r\nThe movie’s soundtrack comprises of a combination of hip-hop and R&B songs. There are 10 songs featured in the album and is released by IM Global Music. The music has been curated by Format entertainment and IM Global Music. The soundtrack goes very well with the movie and is being appreciated by all people who love independent music.\r\n\r\nMarlon Wayans plays a secretive black entrepreneur in this erotic spoof comedy. He starts dating an inexperienced college reporter Hannah played by Kali Hawk. His unusual sexual practices shock Hawk’s character and put a strain on their relationship. What happens when Hannah is taken through the maze of rough, hard and premature encounters inside Mr. Christian Black’s playroom forms the crux of the movie. True to the genre, the movie parodies the original by taking into account the basic story premise, its characters and all the important scenes. Sample this. Hannah is bidding farewell to Black as the elevator doors are closing. Only, the doors are closing several times on Hannah’s head.\r\n\r\nTrue to its tagline, the movie is way shadier than grey in its content and its treatment of the original book and its movie adaptation. It is not easy to spoof a popular movie with a great record at the box office. But Fifty Shades of Black lives up to its expectations and delivers on all counts.

I don't think his voice suits the role at all, it needed someone who sounds more menacing and treacherous. I never felt, away from his obvious acts, any horrid side to Grinch here - though perhaps that suits the aforementioned family vibe they were aiming for.\r\n\r\nAway from Cumberbatch, I thoroughly enjoyed Pharrell Williams' narration and it's cool to hear Angela Lansbury in a minor role. The plot to this 2018 film is solid, but the thing about it that stands out most to me is the humour - which I found consistently amusing, there are some funny gags in there.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a film I'll look back on as being good - even if it could've been greater, especially with a more suitable lead. If we're comparing this and the 2000 production, I think I prefer this one? It's close, Jim Carrey is great in that but this one's pacing is much better."

Tens of stories can be created using such role. But why did they go for a dry story. In my opinion, it should have been in the line of 'Captain Fantastic'.\r\n\r\nRami was okay. He did justify the role he had played. But not like a performance of the year. I understand why this film was very dark, and partially being a dark comedy. The overall storyline looked good. The man with ambition, and to meet that end, he had dedicated his life. But he did not know what he's becoming. It was like 'Split' meets 'Bad Santa'. From all, the boat scenes were a bit of out of context. Yet it brought distinct perspective to the character who was struggling with reality. A film for a few selected people.

        "content": "Miruthan is the kind of film that induces the kind of hand-wringing that is reserved for something you cannot wholly appreciate but also cannot dismiss altogether. For every positive aspect that you try to talk about, there will a negative aspect that demands mention. Like, you want to praise the makers for trying something different — the first zombie film in Tamil cinema, in this case — but immediately, you are best with another thought: 'Did the first zombie film in Tamil have to be this clumsy and unexciting?'\r\n\r\nThe film is directed by Shakti Soundar Rajan, who seems to get his inspirations from the genre films in Hollywood and localises them so that they don't feel like blatant lifts. His first film, Naanayam was inspired from the heist films in Hollywood, while Naaigal Jaakirathai had its roots in the pet films. Here, he takes up the zombie genre, and uses it to spin a plot that also has local elements (thangachi sentiment, one-sided romance, and forced comedy).\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Karthik, a traffic cop whose life revolves around his kid sister, Vidya. Meanwhile, a chemical waste spill results in the infected people turning into zombies, who go after the live ones. When Renuka, the doctor he is in love with, requests Karthik to help get a team of doctors from Ooty to Coimbatore, where they hope to find a cure, he accepts it. But when they arrive in the city, it is already teeming with zombies...\r\n\r\nThe problem with Miruthan is that the execution doesn't match its ambition. The zombie scenes are unimaginatively staged (we mostly get video game-ish shootouts) the behaviour and body language of these creatures is inconsistent. In the scene that immediately follows the interval, we can even spot quite a few actors playing these zombies running as if they are going to get election freebies. As for those bitten, some turn into zombies within seconds while some are able to stay sane even for hours! And, strangely, most zombies keep a safe distance from the hero; even the ones that attack him come one by one (most of the time), just like our villains' henchmen. The shots in these scenes are mostly ramped up to make them seem thrilling, but they end up as amusing as watching a video at 2X speed.\r\n\r\nYou keep wishing Shakti Soundar Rajan had spent time laying out his set-up. All we get is one scene where a doctor explains to the cops about the contagion. Unfortunately, the director spends more time setting up the uninvolving and uninspiring romantic track — Karthik sees Renuka helping someone on the road and instantly falls in 'love' with her, and hopes to win her over even though she is about to marry another doctor. These initial scenes, along with the ones involving the sister as so routine, that we wish there was a forward option to move on to the zombie scenes.\r\n\r\nThen, there are the stabs at humour that make the comedy tracks in the Kanchana films seem subtle. Sriman, a staple in those films, appears as a security guard who wets his pants on seeing the zombies, while the usually reliable Kaali Venkat is given the character of traffic cop who cannot shoot straight. We even get the mandatory 'Ennama Ippadi Pannreengalema' line.\r\n\r\nBut you have to hand it to Jayam Ravi, who acts his heart out that you can't help but root for his character. A few of the zombie portions work — the initial one involving a dog, the interval block when a hoard of zombies take over the van carrying the protagonists, and the climax, which has a superb set-up, at least on paper. Even though the execution is off, the haunting song that Imman provides for this moment, Mirutha Mirutha, hits us hard, and makes us care for the lead pair."

So that mean basically they have all the options in the world to make it a right product. Yet still they fail. This is a big example. It was too Indianised. I mean too much masala which a zombie film has never seen before.\r\n\r\nThe trivias makes the film very interesting to watch, but it was not that good film. The only best thing had happened was the runtime. It was shorter, and then the storyline was very simple, which is okay, but not impressive enough. There are lots of errors, like if you turn your focus other than where and whom the camera aiming, like behind, sides of the screens to have a look at what's going on, you will be disappointed. Because those zombies performances were worst. They just raise their hands and growls, but not making the progress to attack. That shows the inexperience of handling such theme, particularly technical aspect.\r\n\r\nI've watched it just after watching Japan's 'I Am a Hero' and Korea's 'Train to Busan'. So India is lagging way far behind to give an international quality zombie film. They target only locals, which is really bad when recently the Indian films are considered a fastest growing film industry in the world.\r\n\r\nIf you know the language, then you can have some fun with its comedies. Then the ending was terrible, which is not even match to B movies of Eurpean or Holywood. Definitely a skippbale film or watch it on your own risk. Now I don't know what to expect from 'Tik Tik Tik' from the same cast and crew. \r\n\r\n_2/10_"

This often results in him being removed from his job. When he lends a helping hand to his colleague and girlfriend Sunita (Hansika, who gets close-up shots despite her bad lip-sync) in stopping men from urinating in public, he shames Cooling Glass Guna (Sibiraj, commendable as the comic villain), a gangster, and later, his yawn, which has become so forceful that it can shatter glass and throw people off the ground, also leads to Guna losing his eyesight. Sanjeevi comes to know of the history behind the power of his yawn, but Guna, who has regained sight, wants revenge.\r\n\r\nPokkiri Raja is frustrating in quite a few stretches as instead of focussing on his main plot, Rayappa wastes time with unnecessary songs, a comedy track that is as cliched as casting Mano Bala as an office boss, and a romantic track that is lazily written. The hero set his eyes on the white-skinned heroine and starts to take an interest in her; and when he sees her doing social work (something that most Tamil film heroines seem to do), he instantly falls in love with her.\r\n\r\nBut the film starts to find its feet. Sanjeevi's yawning problem gets an explanation (though it is also contradictory to what we are initially led to believe — that it could be fatal), and Rayappa uses this problem entirely for comic effect even into the climax, so the tone of the film remains light-hearted. And some of the set-ups of the previous scenes also have their payoff here — like Guna's henchmen believing that it is the ghost of the possessed woman he had murdered earlier being responsible for his loss of eyesight. Even the extended scene which involves Guna, who has got back his eyesight, discovering his sidekicks' attitude towards him is funny and Ramdas aces this scene. Ultimately, it is such constant stream of laughs in the second half make up for a first half full of yawns."

Finding a way to transfer the actuality of the moment while still feeling original and never appearing boring is a hard task that very few have been able to truly accomplish. With First Man, Chazelle manages to land a spot on that list of directors, and for good reason. He keeps true to the true story with a film that's so intense and fully realized that you might forget that it actually happened.\r\n\r\nSpace movies have always been a highlight of cinema. From Georges Méliès' 1902 silent film A Trip to the Moon and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey to the Star Wars and Alien franchises, films taking place in the farthest reaches of the universe prove to be some of the most intriguing and original creations brought to viewers' eyes (even by today's standards). It's the true stories that really prove to be some of the most effective, however. Sure, fictional ones show us what could be possible; but it's the depictions of true events that show us what was possible, creating a harrowing story of patriotism in the process.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective, First Man is a marvel on all fronts. Linus Sandgren, the cinematographer who won an Academy Award for his work on La La Land, returns to collaborate with Chazelle and once again delivers a grand spectacle that should not be missed out on while in theaters. The cinematography is stunning. Hues of yellow and blue pop, lighting a path towards the characters and showing no sign of stopping once they've started. Certain scenes are given an extra boost from the home-video-style camerawork, beautifully grainy and shaky in all of the right ways.\r\n\r\nJustin Hurwitz (Chazelle's roommate in college), another frequent collaborator, also returns to score the film and knocks it out of the park as expected. Hurwitz obviously knows how to write music, but its how his compositions fit in with the scenes and themes they're tied to that make them so worthwhile. Hurwitz invests you in the midst of all the chaos with all of the orchestral beauty surrounding his pieces. That's the thing about his scores, though: it's hard to objectively rank them because of how different they all are. Chazelle is a unique director because he never sticks to the same formula over an over again, and the same can be said for the accompanying music for each of them.\r\n\r\nActing is on point here; Ryan Gosling hits a huge emotional nerve with incredibly investing performance as Neil Armstrong. He keeps to himself (namely, his personal life) but is willing to risk it all for the mission. Nothing from Gosling is single-layered; everything is complex and detailed to the point that you might as well be in the room with him.\r\n\r\nClaire Foy also delivers an amazing portrayal as Janet Armstrong, Neil's wife. Foy topples every housewife stereotype that embodied this specific time period, giving a strong, contained, and free-willed performance of a woman who is certainly not afraid to share her thoughts on issues concerning her husband.\r\n\r\nThe flag controversy is totally stupid. The moon landing scene doesn't need the image of Armstrong planting the flag on the moon to dish up a heavily emotional response from the audience. If you get a chance to screen it in IMAX, definitely do. The expanded aspect ratio only comes into play during this specific scene but it is utterly transfixing.\r\n\r\nFirst Man is one of the best films of the year, no doubt about it. Every shot is perfection. Every sound is excellence. There is no comparison to what Damien Chazelle and co. have accomplished here; even iconic films like Apollo 13 can't live up to the new bar of quality Chazelle has set for the space drama subgenre. A harrowing journey from start-to-finish, and a true masterwork in many respects, First Man is one film that delivers upon its promise and then some. Performances and technicalities are perfect, but that's what Chazelle will continue to be known for: perfection."

        "content": "**_Aesthetically laudable, emotionally vapid_**\r\n\r\n> _I am comfortable with my level of public discourse._\r\n\r\n- Neil Armstrong declining to be interviewed for \"Armstrong's Code\" (Kathy Sawyer); _The Washington Post_ (July 11, 1999)\r\n\r\nMore an intimate character drama than a grandiose examination of man's place in the cosmos, _First Man_ is far more concerned with domesticity than the actual journey to the moon, attempting to demonstrate that behind the great moments of history exist personal demons and private motivations. Nothing wrong with that of course – contextualising small character beats against a larger historical canvas can produce excellent cinema. Terrence Malick's _The Thin Red Line_ (1998), for example, uses the Battle of Guadalcanal as the background against which to engage all manner of personalised existential Heideggerian philosophical conundrums, whilst Michael Mann's _Ali_ (2001) is more interested in Ali's private struggles outside the ring than his public bouts within it. However, for this kind of storytelling to work, one thing is essential – emotional connection. The audience must, in some way, care about the people on screen, otherwise their introspective problems are more than likely to feel like they are just getting in the way of the larger story. And that is exactly what happens in _First Man_ – there is a lifelessness at the film's core, an emotional vapidity that can't be filled by exceptional technical achievements and laudable craft. The film attempts to celebrate Project Gemini and the Apollo Program, whilst also working as a character study of a man known for his emotional taciturnity. And whilst it achieves the former, the film's Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) is so stoic and closed-off as to be virtually disconnected from the rest of humanity.\r\n\r\nBased on James R. Hansen's 2005 biography, _First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong_, the film begins in 1961, with the sixth of Armstrong's seven North American X-15 research flights (which actually took place in April 1962). Ascending to 207,000 ft., when Armstrong attempts to turn the aircraft back towards the landing strip at Edwards Air Force Base, a control malfunction causes him to hold the nose up for too long, and he accidentally bounces off the atmosphere, forcing him to take drastic action to land. From there, the film hits all the beats you would expect in the lead up to the Apollo 11 mission in 1969; the death of his daughter, Karen (Lucy Stafford) from a brain tumour; his acceptance into Project Gemini; his friendships with Elliot See (Patrick Fugit) and Ed White (Jason Clarke); NASA's shock at the Soviet's successes in the Space Race, particularly Alexy Leonov's EVA; Armstrong's selection as commander of Gemini 8; See's death in a Northrop T-38 Talon crash; Gemini 8's calamitous docking with the Agena Target Vehicle; the death of White, Gus Grissom (Shea Whigham), and Roger B. Chaffee (Corey Michael Smith) during a plugs-out test of Apollo 1; Armstrong's near death whilst testing the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle; his selection as commander of Apollo 11; his marriage problems with his first wife, Janet (Claire Foy); the lunar landing alongside Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll); Armstrong's private sojourn to the Lunar East crater; and finally, the return to Earth.\r\n\r\nWithin this framework, the film remains tied almost exclusively to Armstrong's perspective, with the occasional shift to Janet. This sets up something of a problem, as the real-life Armstrong was very much a reluctant celebrity/national hero, and despite his extraordinary accomplishments, he was not the most interesting, relatable, or easy-to-empathise-with-individual. Never one for the spotlight, when Hansen's biography was published, Armstrong was living unassumingly in a quiet Cincinnati suburb, whilst in a famous 2001 comment, when asked in an interview for the Johnson Space Center Oral History Project if he had ever gazed at the moon prior to the Apollo 11 mission, he replied, \"_No, I never did that_.\"\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, the film sets itself the task of attempting to penetrate this most private of men, explaining why he was so singularly driven, even to the detriment of his family, to the point where not only did he plan not to tell his children he may not return from the Apollo 11 mission, he intended to leave without saying goodbye at all, until Janet changed his mind. And herein lies perhaps the film's most egregious failing. It's almost as if director Damien Chazelle (_Whiplash_; _La La Land_) and screenwriter Josh Singer (_Spotlight_; _The Post_) think the Apollo 11 mission isn't interesting enough by itself – there needs to be some kind of deeper \"why\" behind the whole enterprise. Armstrong can't simply be a driven individual, his heroism isn't enough, there must be some kind of psychological motivating factor.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the attempts to tease out the inner workings of Armstrong's mind don't really work, as he remains very much in his own world, impenetrable to both the other characters in the film, and the audience – no matter what Gosling, Chazelle, and Singer do to dress him up, Armstrong comes across as aloof and interiorised. Partly at fault here is Gosling's performance, with its fulcrum of emotionless stoic masculinity. This is a performance we've seen him give several times before – Henry Bean's _The Believer_ (2001), Nicholas Winding Refn's _Drive_ (2011), and, especially, Denis Villeneuve's _Blade Runner 2049_ (2017) all spring to mind - and this familiarity doesn't help matters. Instead of giving the character hidden depth, the few discernible traits he possesses make him something of a cardboard cut-out, a 21st-century screenwriter's idea of what an American man who grew up in the 40s and 50s should be (complete with retconned political correctness).\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that the filmmakers choose to locate Armstrong's primary motivation in Karen's death, which is presented with a mawkish sentimentality that, at best, fails to convince, and, at worst, actively distracts. With the lunar mission presented as much about advancing mankind as it is dealing with personal trauma, Chazelle goes to great lengths to link Karen's death with Armstrong's determination – as she is dying, he holds her and looks wistfully into the sky (indeed, whilst the real-life Armstrong attests to never gazing profoundly at the moon, the film's Armstrong never stops looking at the thing); after her funeral, he slips her bracelet into a drawer; later, he has an hallucinatory vision of her playing with other children; and on the moon's surface, he drops the bracelet into the Lunar East crater and cries a few tears for her. At one point, Janet reveals that Armstrong never mentioned Karen after the funeral, and that's a believable, and deeply emotional, detail. The problem lies in the overkill surrounding it, detracting from whatever genuine emotion such details should evoke. Every time we see Gosling stare yearningly into the sky, the potency of the film is diluted just a little bit more.\r\n\r\nA big question in all of this, of course, is whether Armstrong really dropped the bracelet into the crater, had a vision of his daughter, and shed a few manly tears, or is this Hollywood romanticising history? The answer is, we don't know. During his interviews with Armstrong and Janet for the biography, Hansen formulated the theory that maybe Neil left something for Karen on the surface. However, when Hansen asked Armstrong if he could see the manifest for the mission, Armstrong told him he had lost it, something which would have been highly out of character for such a fastidious record-keeper. In fact, he hadn't lost it, he had donated it to the Purdue University Archives, but it is under seal until 2020. However, when Hansen asked Armstrong's sister June if it was possible he had left something of Karen's, she said that it was. So, the fact is we don't know what Armstrong did when he wandered over to the crater (his sojourn there was literally the only part of the landing that wasn't by-the-book). However, for me, the whole thing comes across as far too syrupy, an amateur psychological profiling of a man who was intensely private. Personally, I would have much preferred the Lunar East trip to remain a mystery – by showing us what they think might have happened, Hansen, Singer, and Chazelle cheapen the intensely personal nature of the moment, which Armstrong obviously chose to keep secret for a reason.\r\n\r\nA good example of the film's attempts to shoehorn everything into a writer's conception of the story concerns Armstrong's training on the MASTIF (Multiple Axis Space Test Inertia Facility). The film shows him passing out, before coming to, and asking to go again. This pays off later when the Gemini 8-Agena docking goes wrong, and Armstrong experiences the same forces as he did in the MASTIF. However, because of his experience, he remains conscious, and is able to retrieve the situation. Except Armstrong never trained on the MASTIF. The device was abandoned after Project Mercury as NASA felt it was unrealistic, and didn't prepare the pilots for anything they would ever experience in reality. It's one of the ironies of NASA history that the man who experienced what the MASTIF simulated never trained on the machine itself. The problem here is that the real story (Armstrong's sheer force of will helps him overcome the odds) is infinitely better than the invented one (Armstrong's training helped him overcome the odds), which is indicative of a larger problem – the film always seems like someone's idea of what happened.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, Chazelle wastes absolutely no time in letting us know that this is Armstrong's film, with the excellent opening sequence taking place primarily from his POV. However, the scene also introduces the first example of Chazelle's pungent romanticism. As the shaking of Armstrong's X-15 momentarily stops, and the noise dies away, a majestic sense of calm descends. However, rather than trust the audience to extract their own interpretation of the moment, Chazelle can't resist a BCU of Gosling's eyes, with the curvature of the earth reflecting on his visor. On the other hand, a well-handled aspect of this technique is that because the film adheres so rigidly to Armstrong's perspective, very little of what he himself can't see is shown. So, for example, instead of depicting the vast infinite expanses of space, Chazelle keeps the audience tucked tightly inside the _Eagle_ landing module (at least up to the point of the descent to Tranquility Base).\r\n\r\nIndeed, make no mistake, the lunar landing itself is beyond spectacular, with the incredible score by Justin Hurwitz and the superb cinematography of Linus Sandgren (_American Hustle_; _Joy_) coming into their own. The sequence was shot in 70mm IMAX, and it makes extraordinary use of the larger frame, with the first panorama of the lunar surface as awe-inspiring as anything in Stanley Kubrick's _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968) or Terrence Malick's _The Tree of Life_ (2011). An especially well-directed part of the lunar descent is that rather than lay down a busy foley track, Chazelle pulls out the sound out altogether, creating an eerie, otherworldly moment that literally gave me goosebumps.\r\n\r\nThematically, as with all three of Chazelle's previous films, the clash between the domestic and the professional is front-and-centre. _Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench_ (2009), _Whiplash_ (2014), and _La La Land_ (2016) all focus on artists who sacrifice emotional relationships so as to reach an artistic peak – they are all stories of men whose passionate devotion to their work and pursuit of perfection alienates the women in their lives. In this sense, _First Man_ very much fits Chazelle's _oeuvre_, he seems as obsessed with how men attempt to balance work and home-life as is Michael Mann. Armstrong is not an artist, of course, but he is a perfectionist, and the pursuit of his craft does make the woman who loves him unhappy. To this end, Chazelle utilises various methods, such as having NASA radio chatter play over scenes of Jan at home alone. The film's ending is also extremely low-key and private, stripping away the finery of the Apollo mission, and leaving us instead with two people attempting to re-connect.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the magisterial last 30 minutes, and some sporadically well-handled moments, _First Man_ is underwhelming, and, for long portions, interminably dull. As good as that final sequence is, it's no compensation for the plodding and lifeless two hours that precede it. And overall, the film isn't a patch on Philip Kaufman's _The Right Stuff_."

        "content": "Going by his three films so far (Kutti Puli, Komban and Maruthu), it is evident that Muthaiah has a skill for capturing rural areas with a rawness and staging action scenes that make us feel every bone-crunching punch and slice of a sickle. His plots, which are recycled tropes of many masala films, have been the weak links in his films and he compensates this with his unabashed use of violence and melodrama, thus ensuring that his films have something to satisfy youngsters and the family crowd. And his heroes are daring men, who possess inhuman strength and ferocity. In Maruthu, people refer to the hero, Maruthu (Vishal) as \"inathula singam, gunathula puli\" (as if this wasn't enough, the guy sports tattoos of lions on his arms and tigers on his chest). And he makes his introduction when the villain, Rolex Pandian (RK Suresh, who gets another menacing villain role after Thaarai Thappattai), \"Aniyayam panna saami avatharam eduppara?\" \r\n\r\nMaruthu is a sort-of coolie at the local market. His world revolves around his appatha (Kulappulli Leela) and sidekick Kokkarako (Soori, funny to an extent). Rolex Pandian, meanwhile, is a ruffian who is hoping to move to the next level — politics, with help from the local bigwig Bayilvan (Radha Ravi). To do this, he must first eliminate Bakkiyam (Sri Divya), the daughter of Silambam Maariamma, a woman whom he had hacked to death. But, Maruthu's appatha has her own reasons for not letting this happen. \r\n\r\nIn Maruthu, Muthaiah combines a couple of angles from his previous films and presents them as a whole, new film. In the place of the father-in-law in Komban, here, we have the grandmother. In the place of the intrepid hero's mother in Kutti Puli, here, we have the heroine's mother. And he sprinkles some comedy and romance (which is so generic) to lighten the mood now and then. \r\n\r\nThe film also feels overlong, and characters and their relationships are so broadly sketched that Muthaiah doesn't make us care for these characters as much as we should. Take for instance Maruthu's affection towards his grandmother. We are given a flashback to show why she matters to him, but when they are together, we never sense their closeness. One reason for this is the casting. This is the kind of paati role that we have seen earlier in Dhool, but Kulappulli Leela, though she looks the part, tries to make up for her unfamiliarity with the language (the lip-sync is quite terrible) by going for exaggerated expressions. We keep thinking how the late Manorama would have aced these scenes. \r\n\r\nWhat keeps us engaged is the way in which the director withholds information in the first half and reveals them gradually in the second. Once we begin to understand the characters' motivations (like, why did Maruthu's grandmother want him to fall in love with Bakkiyam), we become a bit more invested in the outcome of the story. And there is an assuredness in how Muthaiah narrates this formulaic tale that keeps us from getting bored."

        "content": "For those so-called devoted Tyler Perry fans out there wondering why it took so long to bring back their favorite sassy gun-toting grandma after a two-plus year absence from the big screen can feel some relief that America’s acerbically gray-haired Queen of Quirkiness has arrived for her latest holiday-themed shtick (following the humbug dud known as 2013’s “A Madea’s Christmas”) in the generically goofy-minded comedy horror **Tyler Perry’s Boo! A Madea Halloween**. Woefully witless and as appetizing as a box of stale Junior Mints the terribly contrived **Boo! A Madea Halloween** is a nightmarish experience and it has nothing to do with the nature of the ghosts-and-goblins seasonal spirit either. Indeed, **Boo! A Madea Halloween** screams of being a cruel trick for the mis-treat-ment of Perry enthusiasts eagerly willing to embrace this piece of throwaway holiday hokum.\r\n\r\nPerry, whose brief sabbatical leave from film-making has mainly been devoted to stepping up his various television projects, elects to go drag once again as he dusts off his frothy old ladies garb and grayish wig to bring his acid-tongued _Madea_ to life in yet another embarrassing and exhausting platform in sheer ridiculousness. The majority of Perry’s fare, whether mired in silliness or seriousness, usually has a Christian-based foundation to accompany the robust “slap-you-upside-the-head” brashness that pushes across Perry’s signature penchant for urban wayward wackiness. From a cinematic perspective the _Madea_-oriented movie franchise has been Perry’s most consistent and financially artistic enterprise for the specialized audiences that get a raucous kick out of his over-the-top shenanigans.\r\n\r\nNaturally, **Boo! A Madea Halloween** is yet another convenient excuse for Perry to reintroduce the Southern slapstick garrulous granny to another shameless round of farcical mayhem where the straight shooter oldster recycles the same old gimmick–threatening to hush the mouths of the pesky juveniles that get on her last nerve through preachy sermons and nonsensical action-packed chicanery. It appears that **Boo! A Madea Halloween** is an unlikely senior citizen _Ghostbusters_ knockoff where Perry gets to place the predictable mouthy Madea in idiotic situational “Hallelujah” high jinks. In essence, the banal boofest that is _Madea’s_ Halloween horror hoax is neither genuinely funny or refreshingly spooky but merely lame and forced in its masked mediocrity. Somehow Perry’s off-kilter Madea and her two stereotypical sidekicks in Aunt Bam and Hattie (Cassie Davis and Patrice Lovely) along with the anemic satire of a few notable frightfests past and present plus the annoying hearty-party teens add up to nothing but a smashed jack-o-lantern of random, limping cheap chuckles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to snuggling up to the ballistic and bespectacled Madea’s busty bra and house dresses Perry assumes the role of Brian, a worrywart father trying to contain the hormonal tendencies of his 17-year old daughter Tiffany (Diamond White). In general, Brian’s pretty offspring and her equally fetching friends are curious about attending the Upsilon Theta Fraternity Halloween bash where you guessed it…the scene where touchy-feely hot college guys are there for the taking. Brian’s fatherly instincts is to shield Tiffany and her tag-a-long vixens from that male meat market on campus. Since Brian cannot guard Tiffany due to a business commitment he recruits honorary “warden” Madea, the aforementioned Aunt Bam and Hattie (along with Perry’s other persona in Joe) to watch over the tempting teen to ensure that she stays put in the household. Obviously it is going to be a task for the determined Tiffany to sneak away from the intrusive elders keeping a watchful eye on her. The unflappable Madea and her Preparation H posse are challenged by restraining the young beauty as she attempts to apply an assortment of pranks and other methods of distraction to throw off her geriatric guardians.\r\n\r\nOf course Tiffany is successful in eluding Madea’s clutches and ends up at the Halloween bash after all. Thus, Madea and her old school associates realize the girl’s deception and schemes to snatch Tiffany away from the high-wire costumed event hoping to return her home before Brian learns what has happened in their failed mission to keep Tiffany home-bound. Not only is Madea and her “back-up muscle” in Aunt Bam and Hattie not effective in retrieving Tiffany they bring additional chaos and confusion to the frat house in the process. Madea is dismissed from the Halloween frivolous function but not before the fraternity decides to get even with the elderly loudmouth party-pooper and her aged minions. Madea and her rowdy team are not only in hot water with the miffed mob of fratboys and their guests but she must battle the array of creepy agitators in ghouls, zombies, killers and other ominous spirits looking to tame matured wily women\r\n\r\n**Tyler Perry’s Boo! A Madea Halloween** is nothing more than an aimless, gaudy goosebump of a farce that does not care to incorporate any kind of consideration for the Halloween celebration other than to serve as a shoddy showcase for Perry to parade out the insufferable Madea as well as other degrading characterizations in this relentlessly toothless romp. Perry’s paper-thin direction and scripting is lazy, uneventful and just plain stillborn in conception. The cockeyed camaraderie among Perry’s Madea, Davis’s Aunt Bam and Lovely’s Hattie is synthetic and mindless. The thought of these Halloween-havoc hags engaging in pseudo side-splitting discussions that range from whipping misbehaving minors to the legalization of marijuana comes off as desperately hapless for the sake of the transparent humor. Also, the continual religious-minded exclamations by Madea convincingly overstay their welcome.\r\n\r\nOne never gets the idea that the formulaic Boo! cannot just settle for a side dish of minimal jolts and jumps and just leave it at that level. Unfortunately, Perry lets this myopic material feel labored in its lackluster nuttiness while regurgitating the same old Madea’s incredulous tics highlighted by nonsensical yelling, cringe-worthy bugged-out eyes and carefree slapping.

Otherwise, this dismal bump-and-jump laugher nary registers with crude grandma cursing, tepid off-balance jokes, weak sight gags, meathead himbos and vapid bimbos, stunt casting (YouTube sensation Yousef Erakat), servings of “Oh Lord” exasperation and trendy inclusions of the day (twerking movements and creepy roaming clown sightings that have dominated the real-life news as of late).\r\n\r\nSure, _Madea’s_ sophomoric antics have amassed an inexplicable following in the past but this tired and empty-headed retread is simply going through the makeshift motions.\r\n\r\n**Tyler Perry’s Boo!

In 2010 cybersecurity firms captured and began analyzing the worm. Stuxnet (name derived from merging two random lines in the code) had digital certificates. Digital certificates require biometrics (human identification) and pass codes. But Stuxnet could attain access without that. It ominously coded multiple zero days exploit. Symantec's investigators see maybe one a year, looking at thousands of lines of code. Stuxnet had four. As we learn in the documentary, it also had undoubtedly stolen product identity codes for PLCs (programmable logic controls) from Siemens. Where were these PLCs? Installed on centrifuges at Natanz, an Iranian nuclear site. And the game's afoot. Whose program? To what purpose? Gibney does an excellent job of gearing us up for the technowizardry with hunter/seekers Eric Chien and Liam O'Munchu (Symantec) as geek guides to the nation-state business of cyber espionage and, as General Michael Hayden, former CIA and NSA director calls it, the \"hideously classified\" world of cyber weaponry. We meet the journalists, bench players and sideline government officialdom who were not a part of, or even aware of, Stuxnet. The documentary is a mild, entertaining but serious call to start a dialogue about cyber weapons and deployment of same. How do countries begin to arbitrate treaties regarding use of life-threatening coding? Filmed well, the effects shrouding the unnamed informant are great viewing. The on-camera personnel are well-chosen, entertaining and as informative as they're able to be. There are enough tech buzzwords to keep nontechs like me interested, and enough about how dangerous coding with a mission to DISRUPT DEGRADE DESTROY can be for those of us who count on critical infrastructure systems."

Strange things start happening; then everything goes awry. Burt Reynolds is featured in a couple sequences. \r\n\r\nThe movie starts like it’s going to be a ‘cabin in the woods’ flick, except with adults in their mid-to-late 40s. But the story quickly veers from that standard plot in the second act. This is a crime thriller with ghostly elements rather than typical ghost/slasher horror. The movie compellingly shows how facts can be misinterpreted and a person wrongly judged. \r\n\r\nSome of the acting by the peripherals isn’t so great (e.g. the cops in the last act) but, then, the movie only cost $500,000 and Moro had to take what she could get. But the main cast members are all convincing.\r\n\r\nThe issue of sexual immorality is raised and how “Your sin will find you out,” but this is later balanced out with God’s grace. We’ve all effed up, one way or another, and desperately need grace in order to have hope and live free. The film works up some haunting ambiance and the West Virginia locations are a plus.     \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 56 minutes and was shot in West Virginia (Wyoming County, Pineville, Mullens, Ritchie County, Harrisville).

        "content": "An educated girl falling for a ruffian has become such a cliche today that we have even stopped rolling our eyes when this happens in a Tamil film nowadays. But with Kadhalum Kadanthu Pogum, Nalan Kumarasamy shows that in the right hands even a cliche can feel fresh and new. The film is a remake of Kim Kwang-sik's 2010 Korean film My Dear Desperado. In fact, that film's alternate title, Gangster Lover, is such a blatant description of its plot. But Nalan has localised the story (with quirky humor that is unmistakably his) so wonderfully that right from the initial scene, when we see Yazhini (Madonna) explain how she 'ran away' from home, we are in Tamil cinema terrain.\r\n\r\nShe is an engineering graduate (as she puts it in a later scene, who in Tamil Nadu isn't?) who has come to Chennai from her small town Vilupuram in the hope of standing on her own. For a while, her dream seems to have come true. She gets a job, and does things that a single girl in the IT industry is expected to do. Until, one day, when this dream turns into nightmare. Her company closes down, and she becomes one of the innumerable job hunters in the IT industry. And the fact that she has studied in a namesake engineering college and her lack of experience ensure that she cannot land one soon. But she is too proud to go back to Vilupuram and admit defeat even if it means she has to downgrade her life from living in an apartment to living in a housing colony.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where she meets Kathir (Vijay Sethupathi), who happens to be her neighbour. He is an underling of a small-time gangster-politician, whose naivete and loyalty has been exploited by his boss, resulting in a jail term for a crime he did not commit. Nalan takes his time to show how these two vastly different characters warm up to one another and become neighbours. When he first meets her, Kathir doesn't even offer to help her with moving her stuff to her house, and when they meet for the final time (or so one might think), he has successfully held up an interview for hours with his rowdy act so that she can make it on time.\r\n\r\nThe director is clear that this is as much Yazhini's and Kathir's story as it is the story of their romance, and so we get elaborate story arcs that make these characters feel almost real. We know that Yazhini's father cares for her and despite his reservations initially (when Yazhini points out that scores of girls study or work alone in Chennai, he admits that he doesn't have the courage of their parents), he realises that he shouldn't stand in the way of her career ambitions. And when Kathir asks a younger gangster to quit the profession, we understand why he feels so. The stylish nonchalance of Vijay Sethupathi and the earnestness of Madonna complement each perfectly that we root for these characters to succeed.\r\n\r\nAs for the romance, it might sneak upon the leads invisibly but, we can always feel where things are heading to, even with the smallest and unintentional of their actions, like Yazhini embrace of Kathir in her hometown. Rather than being predictable, it seems inevitable. Some might have issues with the sedate pacing, but this is a film where the magic lies in lingering on — rather than rushing through — in this world. And when the filmmaking — full of breezy visuals (which are made more cheerful by the appearance of rain at crucial points), smooth segues, and expressive musical notes — is so understated and tasteful, what's there to complain?"

His First, 'Soodhu Kavvum' was a massive hit and now back with this retaining the same lead actor. I did not remember the original Korean film this one was based on, but while watching it, I remembered some of the parts. I think the directed did well, because it is not easy to keep up to the original standards. And as usual Vijay Sethupathi did not disappoint me.\r\n\r\nThe Madonna Sebatian's Tamil debut film and she was wonderful. This story was told from her perspective, well mostly, particularly in the first half. The story of an engineering graduate who comes to the regional capital, Chennai, seeking a job in an IT company. As she struggles to get one in this competitive world, meets her new neighbour, a thug who often bumps each other and needlessly have quarrels. But later everything softens between them, because the two are struggling in their life somewhat similarly. So one another, they comfort each other during tough times, till one day when things forever changes in their life.\r\n\r\nFor Kollywood and its fans, this is an extraordinary piece. But for the international viewers, I'm sure you would have seen such films, even though it is worth a watch. The young filmmaker changing the Kollywood landscape. Soon film like this will become mainstream films and the big actor films would turn into the parallel films. Simple story, yet many interesting stuff happens. Todays condition of IT professionals were highlighted quite factfully. It was more a friendship kind of film, but there are enough fun. So I definitely recommended it to everyone, especially if you know the language, don't miss it.\r\n\r\n_8/10_"

        "content": "Watching Natpadhigaaram - 79, you might feel that you have stepped into a time machine and gone back to the 1990s. The film is directed by Ravichandran, whose claim to fame is his debut film, Kannethirey Thondrinal, a late 90s film that, like this one, was also an ode to friendship. We get the staple — romance, misunderstanding, breakup, accident and a climax that almost ends in an airport!\r\n\r\nThe film gives us two pairs of lovers — Jeeva (Raj Bharath) and Pooja (Tejaswi), and Aravind (Amzath) and Maha (Reshmi Menon). The four become friends and start hanging out together. However, Jeeva's family mistakes his rapport with Maha for love and fix their match. Individual situations around this time result in the four not being able to contact one another. Jeeva and Maha realise the mistake, but they are unable to explain this to their families, because Maha's father has only recently had a heart attack. Meanwhile, Aravind and Pooja, who do not know of the ground reality, assume that they have been betrayed and decide to cut their ties off with the other two.\r\n\r\nNatpadhigaaram is the kind of film where every conflict will get resolved if only the characters give each other a few minutes to talk and explain things. And the director, too, is aware and even has a character say something to this effect in the climax. If you can buy into this conceit, the film becomes a moderately interesting one. Ravichandran keeps things ambivalent by giving Jeeva and Maha more in common and does the same with Pooja and Aravind. The former is dependent on their families for emotional support in a way the other two aren't. Jeeva is constantly shown standing up for Maha. He picks up a fight with people at the pub when they tease her; when he is dropping her off at her home, he waits until she has reached her gate on; and so on. The same goes for Aravind and Pooja, who both have rich parents and are interested in starting a company together. Their parents see this as being compatible with one another but they aren't attracted to each other in the same way they are to their respective partners.\r\n\r\nThere is something nostalgic in the old-fashioned way that Ravichandran weaves his plot. And the friendship between the four, too, isn't over dramatised. But the problem is that his scenes that show why the leads cannot talk things out are weak. That Aravind and Pooja don't even attempt to give the benefit of doubt to their respective lovers even once feels unconvincing. And after building up the central conflict for almost the entire duration of the second half, the director resolves it too conveniently in a matter of minutes, with the help of a character — Jeeva's friend — who, until then, only seemed to be a hanger-on. This character, too, is an element from the films of the 90s. In films of that period, he would be played by a comedian (with his own comedy track). He will have a clearly defined relationship with the hero and when he finally pours his heart out, it would feel plausible. In fact, the director's debut film, too, had this same device. But this isn't the 90s, and the director has to invent something new to serve this purpose. But Ravichandran half-heartedly introduces this 'friend' character in one scene, and has him pop up during the climax in a way that doesn't feel organic. He isn't able to generate tension or make us care enough about whether the friends get together. Even a life-threatening accident to one character, which is desperately introduced to inject some climactic tension, eventually turns into smoke without fire."

        "content": "The first half-an-hour or so of Joker plays out likes a farcical drama on contemporary society and politics. Director Raju Murugan (who earlier gave us Cuckoo) doesn't spare anyone. From cops who salute helicopters flying across the sky to leaders who stage half-day hunger strikes and movie stars, everyone is a fodder for his sharply written dialogues that sting like barbs. \r\n\r\nWe are introduced to Mannar Mannan (Guru Somasundaram), a villager, who, for some reason, calls himself the president of the nation (a chart in his house has photographs of all the presidents we have had till date, with Mannan's own mug) and takes it upon himself to solve the issues that he comes across. He also has two accomplices — Potti Case Ponoonjal (Mu Ramasamy), an elderly man who has a habit of taking offenders to court (Traffic Ramaswamy seems to have been the real-life inspiration here, though his look is modelled on the late writer Jayakanthan), and Isai (Gayathri Krishna), a young widow, who shares Mannar's ideals and functions as his secretary and social media manager (she uploads every moment from their protests, and these become viral memes online). \r\n\r\nThere is also plenty of humour in these scenes (a goat kid is called Usain Bolt; Mannar refers to his work place as Pappireddy Bhavan). There are also some issues that keep getting raised again and again — illegal sand mining and open defecation, in particular. And slowly we are told how Mannar became 'President'. We are shown the love story of Mannar and Mallika, the girl from his neighbouring village who rejects him initially and is later charmed by his sincere attempts to woo her (Mallika lays down one condition to marry him — that he should first build a toilet in his house). We also see how Mannar becomes fixated with the powers of a president, thanks to his conversations with a father-figure (Bava Chelladurai). Meanwhile, the actual president is about to visit the village to launch a 'Toilets for everyone' scheme, and Mannar's life becomes interlinked with this. Tragedy strikes in the life of this couple, and this changes Mannar completely, and he begins his unique fight for justice. \r\n\r\nRaju Murugan seems to have realised the chief problem that hemmed in Cuckoo —overpowering melodrama, and in Joker, he strikes the right balance between drama and comedy. And the dramatic moments are dealt with in such a subtle manner that they are heartrending. The director still hasn't completely gotten rid of the didactic nature of his lines, but given that the film is built as an 'issue film' driven by a dramatic plot, this doesn't harm the film much. Still, the climactic breakdown by Mu Ramasamy, while searing in its intentions, sticks out as a message moment. \r\n\r\nStill, the director, once again, displays a flair for using music and casting. Sean Roldan's fabulous songs and score enhance the drama in the scenes, and the actors are wonderful. The two female actresses are very natural while Bava Chelladurai adds humour. But it is Guru Somasundaram's fantastic performance that is actually the film's driving force. Watch out, for he is going to be a major contender at the awards shows next year."

        "content": "If Anand Shankar's previous film Arima Nambi had echoes of K Bhagyaraj's Rudhra, the set-up of his Iru Mugan recalls that of Kamal Haasan's Vikram. An intelligence officer is tasked with investigating and foiling a nefarious plot. The mastermind behind the plot is the man who killed his wife, and he is now conducting his operation from a foreign nation. So, the officer has to go there with a female sidekick in tow and save the day. Here, it is Akilan (Vikram, with beard), a RAW agent who goes after Malaysia to capture Love (Vikram, with prosthetics), an anarchist and a brilliant knowledge about chemicals, to avenge the murder of his wife Meera (Nayanthara, whose character feels underwritten despite a terrific twist). He is accompanied on this mission by Ayushi (Nithya Menen, in a rather minor role), a trainee officer.\r\n\r\nWith Arima Nambi, Anand Shankar showed us that he has a flair for Hollywood-ish action thrillers. Iru Mugan, too, feels like something that Hollywood might have come up with. There is a high-concept involving a super drug that increases one's adrenaline and turns ordinary men into supermen for five minutes. The villain is an over-the-top figure who seems to indulge in evil acts not out of any agenda, but more because he relishes the chaos he can create in the world. There is also a clever twist involving the heroine that is actually borrowed from Fast & Furious 6. The characters look chic and the visuals have a sheen that we don't usually see in our films here.\r\n\r\nBut, unlike the first half of Arima Nambi, where Anand Shankar hardly deviated from the plot, here, perhaps because he is working with a star, he settles for compromises — forced comedy by Thambi Ramaiah, who appears as a cop in Malaysia, that sits uneasily with the seriousness of the hero's mission (it is a stark contrast to what the director achieved with MS Bhaskar in Arima Nambi); a melodramatic character, played by Riythvika, who seems to have dropped in from another film (perhaps Kabali, given that she plays a similar character here); the ease with which Akilan and Ayushi trace the whereabouts of Love, who is built up to be a cunning person; clumsy exposition that is provided through a character (Karunakaran) who seems to exist just for this purpose (the guy works for the villain, but is only too eager to tell everything he knows of his plans to the hero); the several logic leaps (for example, the almost magical recovery by the hero in the climax after taking the super drug, which we are told leaves a person drained for hours after the five-minute mark).\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the film works... to an extent. And that is mainly because the director gives an antagonist who is more than an equal to the hero. His Love seemed to be more of an indulgence in the promos, especially because of Vikram's predilection towards gimmicky roles, but the character works in the film, and keeps us in thrall. And the actor nails both the mannerisms and the modulation of this character. The film feels alive whenever this character is on screen, and that is why the second half — despite the implausible scenes — comes across as more engaging than the initial portions."

First of all it was unnecessary the lead actor playing the both good and negative roles. That gives the impression how character obsessed these actors are. Yep the negative role was powerful, so if someone better actor in the part would have been much better for cinema. That's the major setback in this and the rest of the film is enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of an ex Indian agent who brought in back for a special mission. The death of his wife and this new organisation has something in common. So he has to find out what's it and if they are the same gang, then it'll be the revenge time. The remaining film is a cat and mouse game, and how it all ends was told with a final face off between two men.\r\n\r\nI liked the story, but many scenes were so cliché. Besides, the songs were disadvantaged. Indians might enjoy that, not the international audience, because it disturbed the rhythm of the fine story of an agent. The stunts were okay, the cinematography was good. Actors, actresses, all were excellent. Even that sci-fi theme was impressive. Somehow they have missed to turn it into a masterpiece. So once watchable film, a decent agent film like this won't come easy from India.\r\n\r\n_6.5/10_"

Try as they might, they just cannot garner any evidence to arrest and convict these six men. Suddenly, though - their impenetrable armour starts to slip. One by one, they are apprehended for seemingly unassociated crimes until they gradually come to conclude that it is one amongst them who is setting them up. Who might this traitor be? What is most striking about this drama is the setting. A grim and seamy post war London with bombed-out buildings, a thriving black market and some seedy nightclubs where, perhaps, the less said about the quality of the jazz the better? Peter Bull has one of those instantly recognisable, British Bulldog, faces and he steals this ahead of an otherwise unremarkable cast delivering some standard dialogue before a conclusion that does offer us a twist or two (even if we do, kind of, know who is doing the manipulating). At just over an hour, it's decently paced and delivers adequately for an afternoon B-feature. Not great, but good enough."

Neither the acting nor the script merit much of a mention here, the production is really very basic, and it's all rather dry, but there is some interesting print works actuality from a day when this was an hugely successful publication and we are offered some rather depressing imagery of just how badly the City of London was damaged by the Blitz. The title flatters to deceive a bit - this isn't really very exciting or memorable."

Trace Adkins plays an intimidating saloon owner while Kris Kristofferson is on hand as a bartender seeking redemption from the filth he’s forced to live amidst. Tom Sizemore plays a nasty buyer in the slave-whore business.   \r\n\r\nThis is a low-budget Western that has some technical weaknesses, like dubious continuity/editing, but a compelling story, gritty tone, brutal violence and fine locations, costuming & score. If you don’t appreciate dark, violent modern Grade B Westerns like “Hickok” (2017) and “6 Guns” (2010) don’t bother. The plot is obviously a melding of “Hardcore” (1979) and “Taken” (2008) in the Old West, but without the blockbuster resources. There are a lot of UN-pleasant elements as we see what those saloon babes REALLY had to go through in the Old West.       \r\n\r\nThere are some unexpected highlights, like Marie Oldenbourg as “Girl” in a meaty subplot, but the way it concludes (the subplot) is a missed opportunity. As dark and brutal as the movie is, there are thankfully brief rays of light, hope, reverence and (hopefully) happiness.  \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 38 minutes and was shot at Paramount Ranch, Agoura, California and areas nearby. WRITER: Mark Esslinger.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

I have noticed there are no other reviews for this movie so I have decided to write my own in order to generate some interest in this great, little-known Puerto Rican comedy. The plot summary is provided elsewhere on this page so I'll just say that \"El Detective Cojines\" delivers on its promise to be funny. Writer-Director Radamés Sánchez has taken elements of the private eye novels by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett plus the Spanish classic \"Don Quixote\" and added ample doses of raunchy Caribbean style humor to the proceedings, concocting an irresistible laugh-fest that only prudish squares will not enjoy. Jaime Hamilton (star of the Puerto Rican cult classic, \"Celestino y el vampiro\") is perfect in the title role of the dedicated but hopelessly incompetent private eye, and receives great support from the late, great Argentinian actor Axel Anderson as an old codger trying to find his missing inamorata, Ivonne Caro as a mystery woman with one specific sexual hang-up and René Monclova as a feisty real estate agent who becomes a sort of \"Sancho Panza\" for the title character. Director Sanchez skillfully weaves three story strands into one and drives it home with a hilarious slapstick climax.\r\nCheck out \"El Detective Cojines\". You'll be glad you did."

After spending 130 minutes totally immersed in the world of 1950s high fashion, I felt like an utter rube walking out of the cinema in my jeans and hoody combo.\r\n\r\nPhantom Thread is as immersive as cinema gets. From its opening sequence, which takes us inside the House of Woodcock, a London fashion house run in quietly tyrannical fashion by renowned dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day Lewis), Anderson's film dismisses any thoughts we might have of our own world of 2018. As we witness Reynolds go about his daily grooming routine it becomes clear we're watching a movie about a perfectionist, one made by a perfectionist, and starring a perfectionist in what is reputedly his final acting role.\r\n\r\nSet in his ways like a tree set in concrete, Reynolds knows what he likes, and he likes what he knows. As such, his relationships with the many admiring members of the opposite sex (the film is set at a time when no man was more attractive than one who made things; and if those things happened to make women feel beautiful, like Reynolds' gowns, all the better) rarely get past the following morning's breakfast, where idle chit chat and toast buttering irritate him to a laughably over the top degree.\r\n\r\nIt's during breakfast away from home, in a small country café, that Reynolds meets Alma (Vicky Krieps), a pretty Eastern European waitress who is won over by his flirtatious charm and accepts his invitation for a dinner date. The relationship blooms quickly and Reynolds invites her into his home, teaching her the ways of his trade.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't take long for Alma's ways to begin annoying the fiercely independent and somewhat narcissistic Reynolds, and her presence begins to disrupt his work - she's become an anti-muse! Reynolds' assumption that she will follow the other women in his past and leave quietly once exposed to his spoilt brat boorishness couldn't be more wrong however. Alma is determined to make the relationship work, even if she has to take extreme measures.\r\n\r\nRead the rest of Eric Hillis's review at http://www.themoviewaffler.com/2018/01/new-release-review-phantom-thread.html"

That's not hyperbole either, it felt genuinely necessary so that's what we did.

Hamilton’s pieces exhibited in Standard Candles are a fusion of many contemporary art forms, combining film and video, sculpture, visual storytelling, sound, montage, and performance art, engendering an exhibit that requires multi-sensory and multi-dimensional involvement. Through continuous loops and montage style video pieces created using manual film (super 8 and 16mm), and sculptures made to look like vinyl albums, Hamilton’s exhibition seems at first glance to be a collection of adjoining rooms filled with random, unrelated pieces. When reviewed more closely, Hamilton’s exhibit seems to be asking us all to be critical of our “objective assumptions of order and time”, as well as our notions of measuring humanity and likeness (Dykstra, 2017). The pieces in this exhibition work together in a way that transcends the limitations of exhibition design and connects to viewers in a variety of ways, be it sound, memories, dreams, or notions of physically connecting with the natural world. Hamilton asks us to find a collective purpose in seemingly standalone things, while providing us a variety of avenues to explore these connections.\r\n\r\nHamilton’s piece, David Attenborough Presents: The History of Evolution / The Evolution of History (2012), a short 2:21 film, depicts Hamilton himself, strangely holding a large stack of heavy books, using them one by one to create a pathway into the distance. Before the last book hits the ground, the loop stops and begins again, resulting in an unsettling feeling due to the perpetual, looping notion of incompleteness. This piece is the first visible when stepping into exhibition, so viewers that feel the need for closure after viewing this loop may continue on to find resolution throughout the remainder of the exhibit.\r\n\r\nThe most time-consuming piece for Hamilton in Standard Candles was derived from Carl Sagan’s famous quote, “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe”. Apple Pie (2016) is a full length feature made up of ten short films (Pluto, Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune) (Dykstra, 2017), where Hamilton playfully sought to satisfy Sagan’s heavy demands for making an apple pie. Nearly an hour and a half in duration, this collection of short films fuses aesthetics from early 3D-style digital animation to avant garde contemporary video clips that could have been made any time in between 1980 and today.\r\n\r\nLooking past the unusual array of costumes (ranging from dreamlike feature-less rainbow suits to culturally-symbolic attire) and predicaments framed in this film, Apple Pie hints at the interconnectedness between all living things through diverse aesthetic, auditory, and compositional implications. The fragmented collage-style composition used in Apple Pie is jarring at first, though with continued viewing becomes more cohesive and sensible. Each short film tells a story of its own that ties into the whole, quite like how the individual pieces of Standard Candles have significance both individually and as a series. Hamilton’s exhibit is laid out sparsely and across multiple spaces, making it difficult to pair pieces that could have functioned more successfully together with closer proximity or greater visual association.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the easily-overlooked connections between Hamilton’s works, the perplexity of each piece encourages deep consideration about their implications and meaning. Because of the lack of consistency in exhibiting his video work (some were projected from floor to near-ceiling while others were displayed on mid-sized flat screen televisions), and the sparse placement of his relatively small album sculptures found on either sides of otherwise blank walls, focus was not drawn to any particular piece, likely to remark on the importance of the exhibition as a whole, and the lack of importance of cohesive display.\r\n\r\nWhile Standard Candles could have been more successfully designed in layout and composition, the integrity of Sam Hamilton’s work cannot simply be disintegrated by imperfect presentation. His use of grainy, flickering film provides a beautiful and unique 1970’s-esque component to his video work that is not easily (or successfully) replicated through today’s digital formats. Hamilton’s multi-methodical storytelling approach offers viewers a variety of ways to experience his work, through documentary, silent, loop and montage film, and handmade sculptures of old albums, each method used to explore different ways in which we interact with and understand the world. His pieces embody peculiar scenarios, ones that seem vaguely familiar yet impossible in the real world. While the comfort of familiarity inspires an immediate connection between viewer and piece, Hamilton introduces a sense of discomfort through techniques like masking facial features, connecting a living, standing body to a tree with cloth, and tossing books in a line like stepping stones.\r\n\r\nThese videos, picturing arbitrary scenes, make a point: that humans connect to things and each other in an infinite amount of ways, whether they have had an alike experience, dream, thought or fear igniting that connection. Hamilton’s work uses these sensory triggers to stimulate these associations and establish meaning that is personal and unique for all who experience his exhibition. The result is a meaningful reflection of the human experience, and a wordless commentary that everything that surrounds us is relevant and connected."

        "content": "**All he wanted was to be with his mother.**\r\n\r\nThis can be easily the Swedish version of 'The Elephant Man'. It ain't a biography nor a documentary, yet has a simple and heartwarming story. It is also a sport themed flick. The sport not widely known, excluding the Europe. The first feature film for the director and a good film to debut with. He had waited for a decade to make this film and he should be proud and happy for accomplishing that. On the outside the film looks like ordinary, but not for making. Especially not for a small cost film like this. Everybody had put a great effort, particularly the lead actor.\r\n\r\nThe story of an autistic and severely deformed man, the 30 year old Rikard is not an average guy you would see in your daily life. That is one of the reasons why he struggles in the society. Not because he's different looking, but not all the people are kind to him. All of his life he is known was the game, Petanque. And all in life he wanted was to be with his mother. So he took the game very seriously and decided to win the championship, just to win his mother's love as well. How far he would go and how far it would take him to his mother are the remaining parts to reveal.\r\n\r\nThis is not a popular Swedish film, though I wonder why is that. Of course it did not have any specialty like a powerful twist or turn. All it had was a strong lead character, and with that, it got forward with a clichéd storyline. The scenes were predictable, particularly the end. But I liked the mix of fantasy/illusion and reality. Rikard from the inside, was living in his own world. He had his own version of guardian angel, and a close friend who stood for him all the difficulties. In his both the world, together, they had set to accomplish the things. One of his prime objective was to get back to his mother.\r\n\r\n> ❝Move the centre of the universe. It's the hardest thing to do, but also the most beautiful.❞\r\n\r\nThe screenplay should have been more engaging. Otherwise, should have been emotionalised. Or both. Because such theme needs a strong sentiment base. Definitely that would have drawn-in the family audience. Yet it is still a family film, and the end still be emotional for some people. But for me, it looked more a fairy-tale than touching. Even though everybody must agree that it was an apt ending. The focus was very clear, what the film wanted to show us and what the characters wanted to reveal to us. The characters had less depth, like in case of the mother's role, but ultimately how all of them linked together and brought together at the end was nicely done.\r\n\r\nRegarding the sport from the film, it looks like the marble (goli) game that's played in our local. Except it was the small orbs and instead of the whole arm, just fingers used to play while thumb firmly on the ground. I wish they had explained the game properly for the viewers from other continents like me. It looked fun and simple game, I think I almost understood, except the rules. But I can understand the story was not designed to start the game from the scratch, I mean intro. Besides, it was a part of the story, not the whole story. Nicely utilised a small sport in a film.\r\n\r\nJust below 90 minute film, one of the special film, yet there's nothing too much to praise heavily. Sometimes a simple script like this is better to end decently than too much of establishment to aim greater, which most of the times fails terribly. Especially from the beginner's perspective. So now the director can try something big in his next and can demand big budget as well from his production house. All I wanted to say is if you want to try this, don't anticipate, just watch it with an empty mind. You might have seen many similar films, so as I said it is not hiding that fact, just trying to be a simple, meaningful drama than useless nonsense we see all the time. It is not a must see, though it won't make you any harm for watching at once.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

        "content": "Good watch, probably won't watch again, and can recommend if you're just looking for another version of \"The Jungle Book\".\r\n\r\nI will say they definitely had the budget for a decent production value, and while Mowgli is almost the only person in the movie, I can definitely say that Rohan Chand is a great child actor, and everyone should be watching him going forward.\r\n\r\nSomeone was upset that Disney had \"The Jungle Book\" made as a family friendly, charming movie, and when Netflix was giving away jobs, he jumped in and said, \"It's time for the Nolan treatment!\" and made a grittier more nuanced than intuitive version.\r\n\r\nThis version goes much too far into the politics of the Jungle, and does some really strange re-casts of the characters.  Baloo is almost a pirate captain, or an old military commander (because you remember how when the English conquered India, the Indian fought back on bear calvary, right?), and Louie is replaced with a friendly Kaa (still in charge of \"the monkey people\"), and they specifically go into who is in the pack and who isn't and what laws are being broken.  They even added a new character just to put them in the FRIDGE: I really thought we were done with that trope (it's probably a cliche now).\r\n\r\nThe action is almost all flippant, it doesn't amount to much and it's all shot a little funny to me.  They also added a Gaston / Clayton character as an antagonist so there are alleged twists on how both must be handled.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is mostly fine, but this is LONG, about 1 hr 45 mins, but feels like 2 hrs 30 min.  The story arcs feel more like a run on sentence: looking back I can identify an establishing Act, a climatic Act, and something in the middle that must have been the 2nd act, where all the strife happens, but the weight definitely isn't equal amongst the 3.  There is also no graduating: the fable aspect is long gone, there is not \"leveling\", Mowgli is the same punk kid as when the movie started, he's just stupid enough to challenge a tiger in open terrain (yes, there's more to that, but it wouldn't matter).\r\n\r\nI even like the movie, but this version takes out what little I found special from the Disney versions and replaces it with Batman levels of inner conflict over his identity."

When the film finished we were left with \"a that's it\" attitude.  At best a mediocre film.  The sound for the film was terrible, hardly audible in parts. Scenes did not seem to flow.  The actors were not a distraction, but they left us with the feeling that this was just another movie they are getting paid for.  Did not go to the movie for a religious perspective.  Open minded to any possible correction to beliefs assumed through the years.  It was amazing that I later found out that Mary Magdalene was considered a prostitute, and that it was not until 2016 that the Catholic Church changed her status to Apostle of Apostles. This did not come out in the film."

It's a long 143 minutes, with one scene in particularly lasting an age without really doing much; except the final act of it. A film needs to do more, if this was a documentary - even a docudrama - then fair enough but it isn't.\r\n\r\nIt also wastes a pretty top notch cast. John Boyega is in this, portraying Melvin Dismukes. The amount of times he's just there standing around doing nothing is frustrating, he has a few moments where he gets to act and you can see his phenomenal talent - especially one time where you see the effect of events on Melvin - but that's about it. A waste.\r\n\r\nSimilar can be said for Anthony Mackie, star of one of my favourite films in <em>'The Adjustment Bureau'</em>. He plays such a minor role, you cast someone like Mackie you gotta use him more surely?\r\n\r\nWill Poulter gets most of the screen time. He's good I guess, not sure we need to see quite as much of him as we do - given his character is an open/shut case. Elsewhere, you have other familiar faces like Tyler James Williams (shoutout Noah) and John Krasinski.\r\n\r\nI don't intend to crap on this film. It's clearly well made, has great intentions and relays a notable story. I'm just disappointed with the end product, I judge films as films and <em>'Detroit'</em> is rather underwhelming."

The stories in the film are stories from his life and it is definitely an \"inspired by\" movie. The story of_ Lucky _is not the story of Harry Dean Stanton but Lucky's stories are Harry Dean Stanton's stories. That is how the material was built and when we started to put it together, that is where my focus was - to make sure that the story of_ Lucky _was clear and focused through the material._\r\n\r\n- John Carroll Lynch; \"Inspired by a Legend: John Carroll Lynch on _Lucky_\" (Peter Sobczynski); _RogerEbert.com_ (September 25, 2017)\r\n\r\n_Lucky_ is the directorial debut of prolific actor John Carroll Lynch, who has worked with everyone from John Woo (in _Face/Off_) to David Fincher (in _Zodiac_) to Martin Scorsese (in _Shutter Island_), and appeared in recurring roles on TV shows as varied as _The Drew Carey Show_, _Carnivàle_, and _American Horror Story_. However, more noteworthy than this is that Lucky features the last performance from the legendary Harry Dean Stanton, who was 90 at the time of shooting (Michael Oblowitz's as-yet-unreleased _Frank and Ava_ was shot prior to _Lucky_), and who died on September 15, 2017, two weeks prior to the film's US release. Written specifically for Stanton by Logan Sparks (one of his closest friends) and Drago Sumonja, the film is a meditation on mortality, and is as much about Stanton himself as it is the eponymous character he's playing. Beginning like a quirky comedy full of strange characters with gentle eccentricities (imagine a David Lynch film softened by John Waters), the film later morphs into a more serious meditation on how a nonagenarian atheist with no family faces up to the fact that death is not that far away. Moving entirely at its own measured pace, the film manages to explore a plethora of themes along the way; mortality, routine, impermanence, friendship, love, loss, regret, hope. Laidback and tender, graceful and sedate, _Lucky_ works primarily by way of presenting individual vignettes that very much add up to more than the sum of their parts.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the story of Lucky (Harry Dean Stanton), a 90-year-old living in an unnamed backwater town on the edge of an Arizonan desert. An atheist who doesn't believe in an afterlife or the soul, never married, and with no children, he is happy to explain to people that he's alone, but he is not lonely (borrowing a line from Michael Mann's _Heat_). Living his life by way of a rigid routine, Lucky's day begins with yoga exercises, followed by a walk to the local diner, where he chats with owner Joe (Barry Shabaka Henley) and waitress Loretta (Yvonne Huff), and completes the crossword in the paper. Visiting the local shop run by Bibi (Bertila Damas), he buys a pack of cigarettes, and then returns home to spend a few hours watching game shows. At night, he heads to a bar owned by Elaine (Beth Grant) and her husband Paulie (James Darren), where he trades stories with his best friend, Howard (David Lynch; yes, _that_ David Lynch), and barman Vincent (Hugo Armstrong). However, when he falls for no apparent reason one morning, the local doctor, Christian Kneedler (Ed Begley, Jr.), tries to explain that at his age, the body simply starts to break down. On the other hand, Kneedler is unable to find anything seriously wrong with him, despite his nicotine addiction, pointing out that trying to get him off cigarettes would probably do him more harm than good. Meanwhile, he continues with his routine, albeit more aware that he doesn't have a huge amount of time left. Over the next few days, he attends Bibi's son's birthday party, encounters life-insurance man Bobby Lawrence (Ron Livingston), who he feels is exploiting Howard, and trades stories from the Battle of Okinawa with former marine Fred (Tom Skerritt).\r\n\r\nAnd that's about it. That's the plot (if you can even call it that), and it should be obvious that this is a character-driven film, where the vagaries of a well-laid plot simply don't factor into things. That this is the case is signalled in the slow and methodical opening sequence, which depicts Lucky ambling past boarded-up and dust covered shops, as the hot sun beats down. This is an especially well-handled example of form and content mirroring one another, as the lethargic pace playing out on screen (no one ever seems to be in a rush) correlates with the lethargic pace of the editing rhythm (Lynch allows the scenes, and the characters, plenty of room to breathe, unburdened with trying to race to the next pivotal plot-point).\r\n\r\nThis sequence also works to set up the style and tone which the film will adopt for the remainder of its runtime. Rather than a standard cause-and-effect narrative, _Lucky_ is instead built upon a series of small, usually idiosyncratic, moments, often with only the barest amount of connective tissue between them. Neither does Lucky, nor any of the other characters have what you would call a significant character arc. He doesn't encounter something which forces him to go on a metaphorical/spiritual journey, arriving at some kind of universal truth which softens his gruff exterior. Instead, he's essentially the same man when the film ends as he was when it began, which is, of course, the entire point.\r\n\r\nAlso in the opening sequence, prior to seeing Lucky wandering around town, the film features a series of shots of the barren desert, with a tortoise slowly ambling into view. The film then cuts to Lucky waking up. This could have been a trite metaphor, but in actual fact, this tortoise becomes a plot-point later on; his name is President Roosevelt, and he belongs to Howard. However, he recently escaped from Howard's yard, sending the man into an emotional meltdown, as Roosevelt is his oldest friend. The missing tortoise is one of the few strands which occurs over multiple scenes, and is central to the way the film defines Howard's character, whilst Lucky's incredulity that Howard could be so upset over a tortoise affords him the opportunity for some nihilistic philosophising.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in relation to philosophy/theology, Lucky's atheism is an important component of his character; he doesn't believe in God, an afterlife, or the soul, arguing instead that we only get one life, the corporeal one, and when we die, that's it, we turn to dust, and we're gone forever. However, as Lucky starts to become more and more conscious of the imminence of death, his darkly existentialist outlook starts to look less like a grumpy old man's innocent ramblings, and more like something which could genuinely make his last few years miserable. In relation to this, when Lucky goes to see Kneedling, the doctor stresses the fact that he is both blessed and cursed to have gotten as old as he has – blessed in the sense that very few people make it this far, cursed because physically, Lucky's body is beginning to fail him.\r\n\r\nOne of the major themes in the film is routine; Lucky's day is rigidly mapped out, to the point that if someone is sitting in his favourite diner seat, it throws him off and puts him in a bad mood. In this sense, repetition is a major part of both Lucky's life, and the film's structure (for example, we see him walking his route around town on four different occasions). Another important theme is impermanence, which ties into Lucky's rejection of a never-ending life after death. For example, when he visits a pet shop, he doesn't know what a \"_forever home_\" is, and even when it's explained to him, he still seems to be somewhat confused. Tied to this, the issue of mortality is brought up time and again, seen most clearly in Howard's dealings with Bobby, preparing for his own inevitable death. Indeed, it's worth pointing out that the five yoga exercises Lucky performs each morning are the Five Rites of Rejuvenation, so although he knows this life won't last forever, so too is he doing what he can to prolong it as much as possible. With this in mind, after he falls, the film shifts gears, changing from a pseudo-comic examination of a curmudgeonly old man into a subtle analysis of the inescapability of death and the transitory nature of existence.\r\n\r\nThe film also deals with the importance of small anecdotes and seemingly minor personal connections – scenes which aren't especially dramatic, but which tell us a huge amount about the characters. Working together, the acting, the expressive faces, the seemingly insignificant dialogue, the importance of routine, the crumbling town, the desert, all serve to create the whole, which conveys far more than any one aspect of the film could. However, this is not to say that individual scenes don't work, or are disposable. For example, several scenes contain achingly beautiful anecdotes; Lucky's story of accidentally killing a mockingbird as a child; Howard's narration of what he imagines President Roosevelt's birth must have been like; and, in a scene obviously paying homage to a very similar scene in David Lynch's _The Straight Story_ (1999), Lucky and Fred swap heart-breaking stories of their time in the war (just like Lucky, Stanton was a cook on board the USS LST-970, which participated in the Battle of Okinawa). The film also contains one of the best lines I've heard in a long time – as Paulie is talking about how he used to be a bum worth nothing, but everything changed after he met Beth, he explains, \"_I'm still nothing, but now I have everything. Isn't that something?_\"\r\n\r\nIf I was to find fault, there would be a couple of things worth criticising. Although the film avoids mawkish sentimentality for almost its entire runtime, it does become a little maudlin towards the end. Additionally, by its very nature, the narrative is very episodic, which creates a slight impression of disconnection. For the most part, the tone and design of the film also work to keep the audience at arm's length, preventing us from becoming too emotionally involved with Lucky himself, something which I'm not entirely sure served the film, or the character, very well.\r\n\r\nHowever, these are relatively minor flaws in an otherwise excellent film, and in the end, this is a fitting swan song for an actor of Stanton's calibre. And how many people can say they've appeared in their own filmic obituary?"

You don't get a product like that often. I mean, despite being a gay film, there's no romance in it. But everything was told from a different aspect, like whether it is in the eye of sport, music, et cetera. Maybe if one film that families should watch regarding gay theme, that could be this one. Of course the families should be open minded on LGBT for that. Because the film does not promote gayism, but in a normal tone to say, it's about harassment being whatever you are. And at the end gives a fine message.\r\n\r\nWelcome to T18. I mean happy new year. This is my first review of the year. It is a good start for me being a cinephile. As I've said, it is a rare gem. An Irish film, but in English language. Remember, it is not even a British or Aussie, so the cast and crew are completely unknown. That means it is like watching some B movie. The initial setup reminded me 'Wild Child'. But that was an American film, from Americans perspective, how they see British boarding school. So if you are regular Hollywood teen film watcher, then you might feel slightly strange watching this. Because the students are obedient against their teacher, unlike American rebellious kids.\r\n\r\n> -xX] There will come a point in the future when you won't have to lie anymore. [Xx-\r\n\r\nThe film title might hint strongly that it is a gay romance, but as I said it was not. This is the story of two boys, but most of it was narrated from Ned's perspective. When his parents moved to Southwestern Asia for work, he was left behind at a boarding school. Among bullies, he's very popular for his sexual orientation. But it was never been confirmed, until a new roommate joins him. He's handsome and a rugby player, but they both put together for a talent show, where they have to prepare a song to sing. So the conflict of interest between sport and music surface and fuels further complication in what it is already out of control.\r\n\r\nThis film was made last year, before that year was when the same-sex marriage legalised in Ireland. But the timeline of the film is unknown. Mostly like it just before the legalisation. Because seeing how the story happened, it all makes sense. Still a mixed response from the people, the gays are hesitating to come out of the closet. So the harassers still targeting such people, that's what this film is about. In addition to that, the story was told from the teenager's perspective, but I loved that small part of aspect from a teacher. That kind of looked like a bonus advantage of the film.\r\n\r\nRegarding Rugby, it was part of the storytelling, not the whole story. So whatever happen in the sporting event was a normal result than considered as a cliche. The same goes for the music part of the film too. It did delivered the message cleverly. The best of it was how these two themes were merged to get a wonderful awareness film. Not just one of the best gay film, but one of the best films of the year. Totally worth a watch!\r\n_\r\n7/10_"

Well, no doubt that he's one of the finest actors of this era. Multi-talented, though this film was an above average.

I mean it should have been a pure drama film without any songs and unrealistic fight sequences.\r\n\r\nA famous ex-stunt coordinator, living happily in the twilight of his life with his son and his family. That's what he had thought until every time he ended up in trouble only to disappoint him.

Both, Rajkiran and Dhanush were good. The music was really a disappointment. One of the BG score was quite similar to the film '3'. Apart from stunts and music video, the rest of the film is what worth a watch. A decent direction, that he can still be a great director if try to give more realistic film for such a story. A rare film in Tamil. You won't see regularly a film about an old man. So it should be watched.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

        "content": "**_A well-told love story, set against a background of religious orthodoxy_**\r\n\r\n> _An important point to make from the outset is that Jewish law does_ not _teach that it is forbidden to be a homosexual. On the contrary, Jewish law is concerned not with the source of a person's erotic urges nor with inner feelings, but with acts. The Torah forbids the homosexual_ act_, known as_ mishkav zakhar_, but has nothing to say about homosexuality as a state of being or a personal inclination._\r\n\r\n> _In other words, traditionally, a person with a homosexual inclination can be an entirely observant Jew a__s long as he or she does not act out that inclination._\r\n> \r\n[...]\r\n\r\n> _Lesbianism is never mentioned in the Torah. One talmudic passage refers to homosexual acts between women: \"R. Huna taught, Women who have sex one with the other are forbidden to marry a Kohen.\" The_ Halakhah _rejects Rav Huna's opinion and allows a lesbian to marry a Kohen. However, Maimonides ruled that lesbianism is still prohibited and should be punished by flagellation. The prohibition is not as stringent as that against male homosexuality because the Torah does not explicitly prohibit les­bianism, and because lesbianism does not involve the spilling of seed._\r\n\r\n- Rabbi Michael Gold; _Does God Belong in the Bedroom?_ (1991)\r\n\r\nDepicting the problems that can arise when deeply held spiritual beliefs clash with notions of personal freedom, _Disobedience_ is the story of a forbidden love given a second chance. Based on Naomi Alderman's 2006 novel, written for the screen by Rebecca Lenkiewicz (_Ida_) and Sebastián Lelio, and directed by Lelio, the film covers some of the same thematic territory as Lelio's previous features; _Gloria_ (2013) deals with a 58-year-old divorcée trying to re-enter the dating scene by frequenting singles-bars, and the Oscar-winning _Una mujer fantástica_ (2017) looks at a transgender waitress trying to come to terms with the death of her boyfriend, whilst also navigating a prejudiced society. In _Disobedience_, Lelio turns his attention towards a lesbian relationship within London's relatively insular Modern Orthodox Jewish community. What all three films have in common is the centrality of a complex and strong woman facing up to (almost exclusively patriarchal) societal hostility. Kind of like a cross between Todd Haynes's _Carol_ (2015) and Daniel Kokotajlo's _Apostasy_ (2017), _Disobedience_ eschews melodrama, and is uninterested in presenting a binary story where faith is the Big Bad. Although it is certainly critical of the strictures that can result from a rigid application of _Halacha_ [Jewish religious laws] and/or a literal interpretation of the _Taryag Mitzvot_ [613 Commandments], the community itself is depicted respectfully, with the most representative Jewish character arguably the most sympathetic figure in the film. _Disobedience_ does feature a very graphic lesbian sex scene, but it's one of the most thematically justified, least exploitative sex scenes I can remember, crystallising many of Lelio's thematic concerns. Although things can be far too on the nose from time to time, Lelio's subtle and non-intrusive direction more than compensates for that, and overall, this is a fine film, both thought-provoking and moving.\r\n\r\nThe story opens in a synagogue in London as Krushka (the great Anton Lesser), the local Rav, (similar to a rabbi, except an _Halachic_ expert) delivers a sermon explaining that angels and demons are locked into their destinies, with only humanity \"_free to choose_\". This freedom, however, is both a privilege and a great burden, as it affords humanity the opportunity to disobey the edicts of _HaShem_ [lit. \"The Name\"; used to refer to God when discussing Him outside scripture]. However, before completing his sermon, Krushka keels over and dies. Meanwhile, in New York, Ronit (Rachel Weisz), his estranged and non-practising daughter gets word of his death. After getting drunk and having anonymous sex with a man in a toilet, Ronit heads back to England. At the home of her childhood friend, Dovid Kuperman (an extraordinary Alessandro Nivola), Krushka's understudy, Ronit quickly learns the community is not especially pleased to see her, as the shadow under which she left has not dissipated. Despite this, and although he wasn't expecting her, Dovid is happy to let Ronit stay with him and his wife, who, Ronit is stunned to learn, is her former best friend, Esti (Rachel McAdams). The film then plays out over the next few days, as the community prepares for Krushka's _levaya_ [funeral], as it becomes apparent that Ronit and Esti were once more than friends, which may, or may not, have had something to do with Ronit's departure and her estrangement from her father. However, the more time they spend in one another's company, the more their once-held passion for one another bubbles to the surface.\r\n\r\nThematically, _Disobedience_ is far more concerned with the clash of views that results from Ronit's return than it is with condemning the beliefs of the community _per se_. When she first arrives at Dovid's house, she instinctively reaches out to hug him, forgetting about _negiah_ [the forbidding of physical contact between men and women not related by blood, or married], and he immediately, although not unkindly, recoils. This tells us both how long she has been away, and how thoroughly she has rejected the doctrines of the faith. Later, there is an exceptionally awkward (but very funny) _Shabbat_ [Jewish day of rest] meal, where Ronit seems to take great delight in being as outrageous as possible, riling up the assembled guests with her progressive worldview. In a discussion about the role of women in society, for example, she points out that every time a woman gets married and takes her husband's surname, a part of that woman's history is erased. This kind of ideological conflict, however, is also found _within_ the characters themselves. Esti, for example, is torn between her desire for Ronit on the one hand, and her commitment to Dovid and her belief in their faith on the other. For her part, Ronit too internalises discord; although she has been estranged from him for many years, she is genuinely hurt to learn just how completely Krushka had divorced himself of her memory, seen most clearly when his obituary refers to him as \"_sadly childless_\".\r\n\r\nTellingly, during the _Shabbat_ dinner, Dovid tries to play peacekeeper, whilst a couple of cutaways to Esti show her smiling to herself as Ronit burrows under the skin of those present. This kind of delicate touch on Lelio's part can be seen throughout the film, with numerous wordless gestures allowing the actors to convey backstory in lieu of exposition. For example, after Ronit arrives, although Dovid recoils when she tries to hug him, and although when she tries to light up a cigarette in his kitchen, he asks her to smoke in the garden, he accompanies her outside, shielding the flame from the wind in a gesture both kind and intimate. Another excellent example is found later that night as Dovid and Esti prepare for bed, and Esti gently and playfully strokes his beard, suggesting her genuine affection for him.\r\n\r\nOn paper, the story might lend itself to a condemnation of the kind of social suffocation and emotional repression that can result from fundamentalism. Instead, however, the film spends time building a respectful, if not idealised, picture of the community's beliefs and practices. Although no-one is especially happy that Ronit is back, they are never openly hostile, the way Hasidic Jews, for example, might be. A key part of this respect is Dovid himself, played by Nivola (in an Oscar-worthy career-best performance) as an inherently decent and honourable man; when Ronit returns, he is the only one to extend her a genuine welcome. In a less nuanced film, Dovid would be a fire-and-brimstone obstacle to Ronit and Esti's happiness, a Roger Chillingworth-type personification of traditionalism and rigidity. Instead he is presented as someone who, like Esti, faces a difficult choice – that between his communal position and his faith on the one hand, and his genuine love of Esti and affection for Ronit on the other, his lifelong devotion to the _Tanakh_ [Hebrew Bible] conflicting with the modern day progressive sensibilities that come from living in a metropolis. Indeed, perhaps Dovid's most salient characteristic is conflict – when he tries to lay down the law to Esti regarding her conduct, his heart never seems in it; when he expresses disgust at her tryst with Ronit, he almost seems embarrassed to be reacting the way he is. This conflict is manifested aesthetically in a scene where Dovid is addressing the synagogue. Lelio films the scene in such a tight close-up, that every time Nivola moves even slightly off his mark, he goes out of focus. It's a brilliant example of content generating form, and is typical of Lelio's directorial lightness of touch.\r\n\r\nHowever, for all that, the film never lets you forget that this is a community of _negiah_, where married women must wear a _sheitel_ [wig] in public, and where the genders are strictly divided at religious services. As Ronit and Esti discuss their sexuality, Esti points out that she and Dovid have sex every Friday night, \"_as is expected_\", and that the reason she was married to Dovid in the first place was that Krushka hoped \"_marriage would cure_\" her, a concept not a million miles away from homosexual conversion therapy. In this sense, although respectful of the community, even depicting some of the communal benefits of such a tight-knit group, the film does challenge some of the tenets of their belief system, particularly its rigid traditionalism and myopic sexism, both of which feel increasingly out of place in the early 21st-century. In this, _Disobedience_ fits very much into Lelio's _oeuvre_, with all three of his films dealing with repressive _milieus_ placing restrictions on women.\r\n\r\nObviously, a major theme throughout is sexuality. Much has been made of the sex scene between Ronit and Esti, with some critics accusing it of being little more than titillation at best, a graphic example of the male gaze at worst. However, this reading is to completely miss the point of the scene in relation to the narrative as a whole. There are actually two sex scenes in the film; one between Ronit and Esti, and the other between Esti and Dovid. And although they couldn't be more different, they also couldn't exist without one another, as the abandonment, lust, and sense of pressure being released when Esti is with Ronit contrasts sharply with the detached, formulaic, and passionless scene with Dovid; the two scenes explicitly comment on one another, each hinting at the meaning to be found in its counterpart. In this, they recall the four sex scenes in David Cronenberg's _A History of Violence_ (2005) and Abdellatif Kechiche's _La Vie d'Adèle – Chapitres 1 & 2_ (2013), two sets of two scenes which, again, comment upon and contextualise one another. The scene between Ronit and Esti is the physical manifestation of the characters' long-repressed desire for one another, a release of the yearning that has been building up for years. It's a wholly justified narrative moment, and a completely necessary beat for the two characters. It's not an aside or a piece of voyeuristic male fantasy, it's the centre of the whole film. Together, the two scenes represent Esti's binary choice – an unbridled and sexually fulfilling, but unstable relationship with Ronit, or a dutiful and dull, but respectful and secure relationship with Dovid.\r\n\r\nIf I had one major criticism, it would be that although Lelio's direction is extremely subtle, some of his and Lenkiewicz's writing choices are spectacularly on the nose. The opening sermon is a good example – a religious diatribe whose subject is mankind's freedom to choose, the concomitant ability to disobey, and the notion that freedom is impossible without sacrifice, in a film about these very same issues. Another example is that Dovid and his _yeshiva_ students are discussing the one book of the _Tanakh_ dealing with sexuality rather than spirituality, the _Song of Songs_, whilst Esti's secondary school students are studying adultery in _Othello_. The worst example of this, however, is found when Ronit and Esti go to Krushka's house and Ronit turns on the radio, which just so happens to be playing The Cure's \"Lovesong\", a song which perfectly encapsulates their situation (\"_Whenever I'm alone with you/You make me feel like I am home again_\"). It's not exactly subtle. I'm also not a massive fan of Matthew Herbert's score, with its jaunty use of woodwinds cutting against the ominous tone of the narrative.\r\n\r\nThese two issues aside though, this is an excellently crafted film. Once again examining female desire, issues of patriarchal oppression, and profound self-doubt, Lelio delivers a mature and considered meditation on the conflict between faith and sexuality. Eschewing the kinds of black and white criticism of secular isolationism as seen in films such as Sidney Lumet's _A Stranger Among Us_ (1992) or Boaz Yakin's _A Price Above Rubies_ (1998), Lelio respects the _milieu_ too much to cast it as the villain. Instead, there is an elegance to the way in which he depicts it. Equal parts sensual and spiritual, the lethargic pace and absence of any narrative fireworks will probably alienate some, especially those expecting a pseudo-porn movie, but for the rest of us, this is thoughtful and provocative cinema in the best sense of the term."

Pitched towards a family audience My War with Grandpa is centred around an average family who invite an older relative to live with them.  Due to knee difficulties he cannot easily manage stairs so his grandson is required to give up his bedroom in order for the grandfather to have somewhere to sleep.  Banished to an attic bedroom the grandson declares formal war on his senior relative and an amusing battle of wits and practical gags follows.\r\n\r\nThe cast are very game and embrace the silliness of the ever-escalating war and the story has enough of a touch of realism in its family dynamics to make it very relatable.  De Niro is clearly willing to try anything despite his advancing years and he is given good support from contemporaries including a frail looking Walken, an enthusiastic Cheech Marin and the forever upbeat Jane Seymour.   Uma Thurman has an amusing subplot as the unknowing middle generation between grandfather and grandchild and faces being the victim of circumstance in increasingly amusing encounters with a local police officer.\r\n\r\nProduction values are generally high with some ambitious stuntwork and colourful settings.  I was surprised thought that the credits for a simple comedy ran more than ten minutes, even with the inclusion of a few outtakes and behind the scenes footage the slow paced credits seem unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOverall this was hugely enjoyable and a film I think I will actively revisit until the time when I hopefully become the grumpy grandfather embedded unwanted in his descendant’s household."

It most likely would have been better if it had been a almost more of a prank kidnapping from the kidnapper's perspective, rather than a matter of confusion of identity.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of psychological aspects are interesting about the type of people that would employ or provide these sort of services, and a good bit of humor, usually absurdist or misfortune based.\r\n\r\nWhile there are likely better movies to watch, if this looks interesting to you, then it will probably be."

Amidst their stealing for food and money for survival, they end up stealing the car of Hyung Sik (Ma Dong Seok) who doesn’t take too kindly to their actions. Ga Young is taken by Hyun Sik and Jin Il, Bong Gil and Min Kyung – wanted by the police – must do everything they can to get her back.\r\n\r\nDerailed is a film that isn’t something I usually watch; crime thriller isn’t a genre set that I regularly enjoy. I purely watched this to write some articles on Choi Min Ho more than anything – and I found myself truly liking this film much, much more than I expected.\r\n\r\nThis film was dark, it was gritty, it was stressful. With numerous members of the cast giving stunning performances, I was easily swept up into this horrible – and, all too real for some teenagers – world. This had my heart racing, I ended up chewing on my lip and pausing at times to take a break. The pace in this is well done; we go from seeing the teens resting and okay, having fun despite their predicament to their entire world turning upside down.\r\nWatching them struggle to desperately survive the newest issue thrown at them was harrowing. This was dark, bleak and painful. My heart bled for them, I found myself crying at parts and I couldn’t get enough or finish this film quick enough.\r\n\r\nThe characters in this are extremely interesting – Seong Hoon (Kim Jae Young) took me completely by surprise and even days after finishing this film, I constantly think about him and what made his character the way that he is.\r\n\r\nLee Sung Tae, writer and director, did a splendid job with this film; I definitely want to watch more from most of the actors – this film has solidified me as a fan of them with ease. My eyes are on Sung Tae and what he does next and I’m eager to sit and watch through his other films to see just what else he can get me to enjoy.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Derailed was a brilliant film and I cannot wait to discover more from those involved in the film."

There is no other like us. There never has been. We are, as a matter of empirical fact and undeniable history, the greatest force for good the world has ever known._\r\n\r\n- Dick Cheney; _Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America_ (2015)\r\n\r\nAs a non-American, I've always been fascinated by the concept of a two party system. Breeding rancour and division by its very nature, with only two sides from which to choose on any issue, the more controversial a subject is, the wider the ideological gap becomes. I'm not sure if it's a cause or a symptom, but intricately intertwined with such deep-rooted partisanship is the fact that everyone seems to be preaching to their own choir; Republicans have Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and Ben Shapiro (and Alex Jones), whilst Democrats have Bill Maher, Anderson Cooper, and Chris Cuomo (and Cenk Uygar). The problem is that the people watching _Fox and Friends_ and reading _Breitbart_ are already staunchly on the right, whilst those watching CNN and reading _The New York Times_ are already firmly on the left; everyone is sermonising to the already converted, and no one is listening to what the other camp is saying. Written and directed by Adam McKay, _Vice_ is a good example of this; it's a left-leaning film made by left-leaning people for a left-leaning audience. When McKay was asked by the _ACLU_ if he had any theories as to why Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump allegedly walked out of a screening, his response was telling; \"_I think the bigger question is: Why did they buy two tickets and walk in?_\"\r\n\r\nOstensibly a biopic of former Vice President Dick Cheney, _Vice_ argues that he was actually the _de facto_ President, with George W. Bush taking a back seat, particularly in the globally crucial years from 2001-2003. Very much a political satire in the vein of Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis and Jonathan Swift, or films such as Barry Levinson's _Wag the Dog_ and Joe Dante's _The Second Civil War_ (both 1997), _Vice_ eschews conventional narrative structure, breaks the fourth wall regularly, intercuts shots of fly-fishing and animals hunting into the middle of tense plot-heavy dialogue scenes, features several self-reflexive references to itself, has a false ending, has a scene in which characters speak in iambic pentameter, and in a deleted scene, the entire cast breaks into song. Much as was the case with recent \"based on a true story\" films such as Spike Lee's _BlacKkKlansman_ and Jason Reitman's _The Front Runner_ (both 2018), _Vice_ has one eye on the here and now, using Cheney's story as a vehicle to examine the current political situation in the US, positing that without the power-mad Dick Cheney and the Unitary Executive Theory, there would never have been a Donald Trump. However, although there are many individual moments of brilliance, the film is unsure if it's a straightforward biopic or an excoriating satire, ultimately finding a kind of ideological middle ground that mixes comedy with pathos, not always successfully.\r\n\r\nNarrated by Kurt (Jesse Plemons), a fictitious veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, who claims to have a unique connection to Cheney, the film begins in Wyoming in 1963 as a young Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) is arrested for drunk driving for the second time. It then cuts to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, as Cheney orders the shooting down of any suspicious commercial airliners, despite President Bush (who was en route to Washington from Florida) not signing off on such an order. How Cheney got from being a drunk in 1963 to taking control of the government in 2001 is the film's primary focus, introducing us to a huge cast of characters (played by an extraordinary ensemble), all of whom feature in Cheney's rise to power in some manner – Lynne Vincent (Amy Adams), Cheney's fiancée and later wife; Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell), under whom Cheney worked from 1969, later White House Chief of Staff (1970-1971) and Secretary of Defense (1975-1977 and 2001-2006); Gerald Ford (Bill Camp), President (1974-1977), for whom Cheney was White House Chief of Staff; George H.W. Bush (John Hillner), President (1989-1993), for whom Cheney was Secretary for Defense; Liz (Lily Rabe) and Mary (Allison Pill), Cheney's two daughters; Roger Ailes (Kyle S. More), founder of Fox News; George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell), President (2001-2009), for whom Cheney was Vice President; Scooter Libby (Justin Kirk), Chief of Staff to the Vice President (2001-2005); David Addington (Don McManus), Cheney's legal counsel (2001-2005) and Chief of Staff to the Vice President (2005-2009); Colin Powell (Tyler Perry), Secretary of State (2001-2005); Condoleezza Rice (LiaGay Hamilton), National Security Advisor (2001-2005) and Secretary of State (2005-2009); Paul Wolfowitz (Eddie Marsan), Deputy Secretary of Defense (2001-2005); George Tenet (Stephen Adly Guirgis), Director of Central Intelligence (1996-2004); Karl Rove (Joseph Beck), Senior Advisor to the President (2001-2007); Trent Lott (Paul Perri), Senate Minority Leader (2001-2003); Jay Bybee (Brandon Firla), Assistant Attorney General (2001-2003); and John Yoo (Paul Yoo) Deputy Assistant Attorney General (2001-2003). Within this framework, the film hits all the beats you'd expect – the bombing of Cambodia (1969-1970); the formation of Al-Qaeda (1988); the outbreak of the Somali Civil War (1988); the invasion of Panama (1989); the Gulf War (1990-1991); Cheney's time as CEO of Halliburton (1995-2000); 9/11 and the invasion of Afghanistan (2001); the \"Torture Memos\" and \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" (2002); the invasion of Iraq (2003); the Plame affair (2003); the accidental shooting of Harry Whittington (2006); the rise of IS; Cheney's 13% approval rating upon leaving office (2009); his heart transplant (2012); and the breakdown in Mary's relationship with her family when Cheney gives Liz permission to oppose gay marriage whilst running for the Senate, despite Mary being a married to a woman (2013).\r\n\r\nIn writing Vice, McKay focused on five main sources – David Corn's _The Lies of George W. Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception_ (2003), Ron Suskind's _The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11_ (2006), Michael Isikoff and David Corn's _Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War_ (2006), Barton Gellman's _Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency_ (2008), and Jane Mayer's _The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals_ (2008).\r\n\r\n_Vice_ presents Cheney as devoid of ideology, with a Zelig-esque ability to alter his manner so as to best deal with whomever it is in whose company he finds himself. In this sense, his political ambition is portrayed as cynical and mercenary; McKay's Cheney has no interest in attaining power so as to influence policy or stimulate ideological change, he is obsessed only with power-for-power's sake. One of the most telling scenes in the film happens quite early when he learns that President Richard Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger are planning to bomb Cambodia without going through Congress. Asking Rumsfeld, \"_what do we believe?_\", he is met by Rumsfeld laughing hysterically at being asked such a ridiculous question. Speaking to The New Yorker, McKay explains,\r\n\r\n> _what I found – and I know there are people who disagree with this – was a surprising lack of ideology. I found beliefs that would flip and flop, based on what was convenient and what was strategically useful._\r\n\r\nHowever, although the film presents Cheney as lacking ideology, it does show him as passionate when he adopts (and later usurps) the Unitary Executive Theory (essentially, the idea that the President should have virtually unchecked power to direct the Executive Branch, particularly during times of crisis). McKay tells _The New Yorker_,\r\n\r\n> _at one point, he even says the President should have certain monarchical prerogatives._\r\n\r\nSpeaking to _ACLU_, he says of Cheney's adoption of the Theory,\r\n\r\n> _you see it constantly throughout his career – his attempts to expand executive reach, expand executive authority, to operate without transparency, to operate with impunity._\r\n\r\nKey lines in this respect include Cheney arguing, \"_if the president does it, it's legal_\", and, when discussing the issue of the US using torture, \"_if the US does it, by definition, it can't be torture_\".\r\n\r\nNowhere is his character shown as more ruthless than in a scene towards the end of the film. In 2013, Liz is running for the Senate when a TV advert from a group affiliated with the incumbent Senator for Wyoming, Mike Enzi, claimed that she \"_aggressively promotes gay marriage_\". Mary had been married to Heather Poe since 2012, and although Cheney and Liz knew it went against their party's doctrines, they had supported her. However, the day after the advert aired, Liz appeared on _Fox News Sunday_ and said she did not support gay marriage. The following day, Cheney and Lynne released a statement supporting Liz, and causing a rift between the family and Mary which remains to this day. The film features a scene the night before Liz goes on TV, in which she asks permission to say she opposes gay marriage. In a chilling moment lifted right out of Francis Ford Coppola's _The Godfather Part II_ (1974), Cheney indicates his approval with a single silent nod of his head. Speaking to _ACLU_ about this scene, McKay states,\r\n\r\n> _that to me is what made it a complete and total tragedy and that's the final kind of tally, the final destructive count of power. Is what he did to the country, what he did to countries like Iraq, punching holes in the Geneva Convention, what he did to the checks and balances of our democracy, what he did to the spirit of the American voter, the spirit of the American nation. And then the final thing, the tools that he used_ […] _eventually took down his own family. So to me at that point the tragedy was complete on every level: personal, family, country, world._\r\n\r\nMuch as in _BlacKkKlansman_, _Vice_ concludes with a haunting montage that brings the story up to date, showing some of the long-term effects of the Bush-Cheney years (instability in the Middle East, irreparable damage to the environment, the rise of IS). In relation to the here and now, although Trump is never explicitly mentioned (and is only shown for a split second in archive footage), McKay is unafraid to admit that the film is not entirely focused on the past. Speaking to the _New York Times_ about Cheney's dismantling of executive checks on power, McKay states,\r\n\r\n> _Cheney was the expert safecracker who opened up the safe, and now the orangutan is in there, throwing around the money and the jewels._\r\n\r\nHe also sees the film as something of a corrective, a reminder of just how bad it was during Bush's time in office, telling _ACLU_\r\n\r\n> _somewhere along the line, Donald Trump got elected, and all of a sudden we started hearing people say, \"Hey, I kind of miss George W. Bush. You know, he wasn't that bad, him and Cheney.\" And then I really felt like I got to make the movie. I was like, this is crazy that people are saying this._\r\n\r\nAs with McKay's previous film, _The Big Short_ (2015), _Vice_ is aesthetically audacious. While there are fewer self-reflexive celebratory cameos explaining difficult terminology in direct-to-camera monologues (sadly, there's no Margot Robbie in a bath this time around), the film is edited in such a way as to remind me of Oliver Stone's \"horizontal editing\" in films such as _JFK_ (1991), _Natural Born Killers_ (1994), _Nixon_ (1995), and _U-Turn_ (1997). It's no coincidence that Vice was cut by Hank Corwin, who cut all of the above except _JFK_. This style of hyperkinetic editing can be seen throughout the film. For example, as Chaney attempts to manipulate Bush into agreeing to give him more power, there are intercepts of fly-fishing. It's not subtle, but it is effective. Indeed, this recalls an earlier scene when Cheney is teaching his daughters to fish, explaining,\r\n\r\n> _you have to find out what the fish wants, and then you use that to catch the fish._\r\n\r\nElsewhere, much as Stone uses Coke commercials and footage from old films in _Natural Born Killers_, Vice features excerpts from the Budweiser \"Whassup?\" commercial (1999) and _Survivor_. In another scene, when Cheney first learns of the Unitary Executive Theory from Antonin Scalia (Matthew Jacobs), he immediately realises it is his road to power, and the film cuts to a lion bringing down a gazelle. For me though, some of the most effective editing in the film is more conventional. One particularly strong example is as Bush declares war on Iraq, the camera tilts down to show his leg is shaking. The film then cuts to a shot of an Iraqi civilian's leg shaking as the bombs begin to drop.\r\n\r\nAlso similar to _The Big Short_ is the film's sense of humour, with a tone of irreverence established from the very beginning, as the opening legend states,\r\n\r\n> _the following is a true story. Or as true as it can be given that Dick Cheney is known as one of the most secretive leaders in recent history. But we did our fucking best._\r\n\r\nA particularly sardonic scene comes about an hour in, as the film shows Cheney stepping away from politics in 1993 and later turning down Bush when he asks him to be his running mate in 2000. At this point, the legend explains that Cheney had chosen his family over politics, and that he happily lived out his days in Wyoming, becoming known as a great philanthropist and fly fisherman. As the Cheneys gather around a family barbeque, triumphant music swells, and the closing credits start to roll, only for the movie to interrupt itself, pointing out that that's not what happened at all, and then continuing with the narrative. It's a very meta technique, and one which both mocks feel-good biopics, whilst also providing a sly criticism of Cheney himself – had he not returned in 2000, the world could have had this happy ending.\r\n\r\nAnother very funny sequence sees Cheney and Lynne in bed discussing whether or not he should accept Bush's offer, with the narrator explaining,\r\n\r\n> _sadly there is no real way to know exactly what was going on with the Cheneys at this history-changing moment. We can't just snap into a Shakespearean soliloquy that dramatises every feeling and emotion. That's just not the way the world works._\r\n\r\nThis is immediately followed by Cheney and Lynne speaking in _faux_-Shakespearean blank verse (\"_Hast blindness usurped vision in you my wife?_\", \"_Mine own blood and will are yours til pierc'd be the last soldier's breastplate, spilling open its jellied ruby treasures_\") as they work themselves up into a sexual frenzy (although technically, this is a duologue, not a soliloquy). There is also a scene in which Cheney meets two oil executives, whose faces are blurred out, and whose names are bleeped every time they are spoken. In another scene, a waiter (Alfred Molina), reads from a menu that features various forms of Cheney-endorsed torture;\r\n\r\n> _tonight, we're offering the enemy combatant, whereby a person is not a prisoner of war, or a criminal, which means, of course, that he has absolutely no protection under the law._\r\n\r\nAfter listening to their options, Cheney gleefully declares, \"_we'll take it all_\". There is also a hilarious mid-credit scene, which sees a focus group descend into chaos when a conservative calls a liberal a \"_libtard_\", prompting a mass brawl. Ignoring the fight, however, are two young girls who are instead interested only in speculating as to the quality of the new _Fast & the Furious_ film.\r\n\r\nFor all that, however, _Vice_ isn't a patch on _The Big Short_, for a number of reasons. For example, whereas in _The Big Short_, the self-reflexive _Tristram Shandy_-style narrative structure worked to the film's advantage, providing a way into the complex story, here it has the exact opposite effect, oftentimes distracting from McKay's thematic concerns, preventing the film from focusing on telling us how (and why) Cheney exploited loopholes in executive power to restructure US foreign policy. McKay is also less successful at moving from scenes of quiet tragedy to scenes of comedy than he was in _The Big Short_.\r\n\r\nThe most egregious problem, however, is that the film fails to give any kind of psychological verisimilitude or interiority to Cheney. Presenting him in an almost robotic manner, there is very little on what drives him, depicting his various deeds without offering anything cogent in terms of his motivations. Is he simply an ideologically-weak opportunist? Is he an evil megalomaniac fuelled by a deeper purpose, and if so, what purpose, and how? Could it all really have been about power, viewing the global geopolitical sphere as his own personal playground and nothing more? And if the film is arguing this, suggesting that this man, responsible for so much pain and suffering, did it all simply because he liked power, isn't that to downplay his agency, to allow one to argue that he didn't really know how much damage he was causing? Depriving him of psychology weakens any attempt to censure his actions. The film's Cheney is ultimately unknowable, and that makes his acts more easily forgivable. The argument that it was all because of power and greed really does next-to-nothing to help explain the man. And in any case, if we accept the thesis that Cheney cared only for power, then surely he warrants serious moral scrutiny, not a self-reflexive and, at times, self-congratulatory narrative that assumes the audience agrees with it before it has even said anything.\r\n\r\n_Vice_ traces all of Cheney's acts back to Lynne dressing him down when he was younger, suggesting that without her prodding, this unambitious two-time Yale dropout would never have gotten into politics in the first place (it's telling, perhaps, that Lynne is unenthusiastic when she learns Cheney is thinking of accepting Bush's offer to be his running mate, pointing out, \"_the VP just sits around and waits for the president to die_\"). But to reduce all of it to being told off by wife, seems far too easy, although it could, I suppose, be cited as an example of the banality of evil. Except that the film's Cheney is anything but banal. In fact, he's terrifying.\r\n\r\nCheney pressured the CIA to find links between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein so as to justify invading Iraq. He oversaw the public relations campaign to build popular support for the war. He encouraged the torture of terror suspects all the while denying it was torture. He was responsible for the worst strategic blunder in US history, the growth of a domestic surveillance state, the dictatorialisation of the office of the President, and the deaths of 4,000 American troops and at least 100,000 Iraqi civilians, although possibly as many as 500,000. His contempt for and willingness to rewrite the rule of law makes him a precursor of Trump. Positing him as a man who was power-mad and little else, _Vice_ remains always on the outside, trying to listen through the wall, never managing to open the door and expose his actual inner workings. The comedy and structural experimentation make it entertaining as a film, but it tells us very little about Cheney that we didn't already know. Strip away the artifice, and you'll find it doesn't have a huge amount to say. Never attaining the scale of tragedy to which it clearly aspires, the film functions instead to remind critics of Bush's cabinet why they became critics of Bush's cabinet. In the end, rather than exposing Cheney's dark soul, the film argues that he doesn't have one. And that is a far less interesting thesis."

It is quite surrealistic and it does indeed take some time to figure out what is really going on. The landscape in which the main protagonist finds himself is weird, depressing and beautiful at the same time. I have to say that I found the special effects quite well done. If you consider that budget was a measly 4 million dollars the special effects become downright impressive. But then, in Russia you probably get quite a bit more for your money than in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nI do like the general theme of the landscape where bits and pieces of reality is thrown around on a backdrop of filaments that looks like synapse network of a big brain. Actually this is not far from the truth and fits well with the story.\r\n\r\nThe story is perhaps a wee bit predictable just from the name of the movie but it is still not at all bad and it actually hangs together fairly reasonable. Okay it is science fiction after all but it is still a good story.\r\n\r\nI’ve seen a few people complain about the movie. For instance that the story was a rip of Matrix and other movies. That is BS to me. I think this movie have a story of its own. Some people also complained about how bad the acting was. Well, if you watched a dubbed version of it maybe. If you cannot watch a movie in its original language then don’t bother commenting about the acting. The most pathetic comment I saw was one saying “Not too bad for not being a Hollywood movie”. Seriously? Considering the amount of woke and unintelligent crap Hollywood spews out nowadays that is a laughable statement.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I would have liked to be better with the movie was the ending. It kind of fizzled out without any real climax, neither good not bad.\r\n\r\nApart from that this movie is well worth watching for any science fiction fan."

        "content": "**The three sisters all the literature lovers should know.**\r\n\r\nI was not excited to see it, because I have had no idea about whose biopic was this. I did not bother to know everything before giving it a try. One of the reason was, I usually enjoy most of the BBC films. I knew it was a period drama and about some famous writers. So, when I saw the very first scene, as kids running around with flames on their heads, I thought it would be some kind of a fantasy film. That was that, in the next minute, it became a different film. For a tale like this, it was a great opening scene. A perfect clue for the viewers what's coming in the latter part of the story.\r\n\r\nThose four kids are the siblings and the story takes place in the mid 19th century England. Revolves around the Bronte family living in a small town, majorly focused on the three sisters in the span of three years, the most important years of their lives. Motherless children, grown to adulthood, they struggle to keep the family name honourly in the community. Their only hope is their brother who supposed to be a successful writer is now at worst as his doomed romance has taken him down with.\r\n\r\nAs I know those eras were, particularly the women, it's about marrying at the young age and settling down with the husband. I don't know the actual reason why those sisters remained unmarried, but I have a couple of perspective in my mind, that might be inappropriate to say out, yet the film kind of breaks the stereotype of women of those times. I blame their father, as well as their brother, but still these sisters are one of the greatest historic figures I've come to learn about.\r\n\r\nIt's the time the three sisters to make some quick decisions. At the beginning, it stumbles upon them, but very soon they overcome and takes the responsibility since they are very enthusiast in the literature work. At present, we're witnessing the rise of voice against the gender inequality in society all over the world in all the fields. Even the last week, Elizabeth Banks falsely accused the Steven Spielberg for the same reason. In this film, it was not exactly a fight or protest against such discrimination in society. Though their contribution, their achievement was the beginning of the new path for women of those eras and onwards.\r\n\r\nThey took paper and pen, and began to express the reality of the society in words rather to focus on the trend in literature subjects. Then came the publication. Even newbie men would struggle on that phase. It was one of the best juncture in this storytelling. Their struggle is not merely to turn their work into a book, but the family, especially their brother who was drifting away from everything posed a great challenge to them to look after him. And so their aging father.\r\n\r\n> ❝When a man writes something, it's what he's written that's judged. When a woman writes something, it's her that's judged.❞\r\n\r\nWhen the film enters the third act, there are more twist and turns in the tale. Throughout, there were lots of ups and downs in the narration. Suddenly there comes an interesting scene and then for next 5-10 minutes falls back with a casual life event. Great screenplay and dialogues. The music was even better and suitable to the tale. The locations were beautiful, especially if you love chilly English weather and the countryside hilly views. One of the best depiction of the 19th century in a film. A special awards should be given to the set decoration. After watching the film, I browsed about that on the net and I stunned. The production quality was a genius, particularly for a television film.\r\n\r\nAmazing casting. I should praise the director who also wrote for it. He's originally a writer who worked with some great television shows, and now this is his first film directional debut. One of the scenes about the original identity at close to the end of the film was really a goosebump part. It all depends how you yourself dissolve in the narration. I thought it was too short, even though it ran for two hours. That's why I wished it should have been a television series, to I stay with it for a little longer.\r\n\r\nA perfect title, I loved everything about the film. The costumes were simple, but very good. And the film was very emotional at the end, to learn what happened to those three sisters. The filmmakers avoided that sentimental part, but I would have liked if they had covered them visually than the texts. Then it would have been one of the best tearjerker and then more family audiences would have jumped in to watch.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it's very satisfying to learn about how those masterpieces were made than reading and watching those masterpiece books and films respectively. Now it's in the line of 'Finding Nevreland', 'Saving Mr. Banks' and a few others that revealed the truth behind the great works. My only disappointment was, it should have been either a theatrical film or a television series. No offense, all the actors were so awesome in this film. Those three sisters stole the show. It was a powerful performance I've seen in the recent time. But a big screen film with popular stars would help reach the product widely.\r\n\r\nIt's just less than a month to go to the announcement of the list of nominees of the Emmy Awards. I hope this film would make into and winning will be an even better result. This is now one of my favourite films of all time. Particularly that made for television section and British/BBC's. We watch films often, but some people occasionally, even though we won't end up watching masterpiece all the time. It's a rare thing and this is one them. If you are interested in literature, biography, history or seeking an inspiration, this is the film to go for. Since I watched it, I could not take off the memories of the film and focus on other things. Really, it made my day and the whole week. So it's a two thumbs up high in the air from me. Highly recommended.\r\n\r\n_9.5/10_"

        "content": "**An unusual friendship and rare benefit out of it.**\r\n\r\nI did not dig for detail to decide to watch this film. Just by reading the title I have come to know I should see this. But later I learnt that it was from the director of 'Brothers of the Wind' I review a year ago. They say it was the third film in the 'man and wild animal relationship' trilogy, but I've seen only this and the one I mentioned in the previous line. The other one, the first one is 'Among Wolves' that's surely I going to check it out as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around a park ranger, Beto, from the remote place in the south of the Argentina. He has a special relationship with the Orcas that strays on the edge of the coast nearby a lighthouse. People come to pay to see them, but on one occasion a mother and her autistic son from Spain visit him. Initially he refused to help her, but later he changes his mind with a purpose in his mind. So the days go on and what follows after that are some unexpected development which leads to the film's conclusion.\r\n\r\nAdapted to the screen from the novel by Roberto 'Beto' Bubas that he inspired to write by his real life event. Though initially I mean in the very first scene I thought it was so cruel. Not anybody wants to see that kind of opening. Especially not the kids or the families. If you are an animal lover, you would feel like that way as well. But very soon you will come to understand it is the way of nature and we're just a witness. Just like you watch Nat Geo and Animal Planet. Apart from that hurtful fact, the film was really good. \r\n\r\n> ❝They (orcas) are my family in the sea. And I'm their friend on the coast.❞\r\n\r\nThe characters were awesome. It was a limited cast, that's because most of the film takes place in the isolated location with three main characters. Very slow narration, particularly you won't get much progression in the first half. Kind of feels like a documentary film, that focused on a national park ranger's life. But in the last half an hour everything changes. An unpredictable event comes into play to steer the narration swiftly towards the tale's climax.\r\n\r\nAt some point I thought it was another film in the 'Free Willy' series. If you had seen that trilogy + one (tetralogy) and when you see this, you would think only that way. Not just because of the man and orca relationship, but the way they presented on the screen was like directly borrowed from there. But most importantly, it was based on the real which surely erase that kind of thinking from the viewers.\r\n\r\nIt was just like any other film that portrays an autistic character. But at the beginning, it did not pay any attention to that role. The perspective of the tale was from the Beto, so he led to shaping the entire narrative, until the last moment. That's when the boy took over to bring most required reorder in the story you had seen so far to something new. They all well acted, with the beautiful locations in the front and the background. It was not a masterpiece, but definitely it is among its kind.\r\n\r\nThe direction must be praised. I really like him. He is like a travel filmmaker. Yesterday he made a European film, today a South American and tomorrow it could be an African or Asian. What I most impressed was, his films are not aimed at commercial benefits. But very artistic, and mostly factual like a documentary film with a light stroke of fantasy to add a better storyline to attract little folks. His target audience are children and the families, and obviously the animal lovers. So if you know him, his works, then you must not miss this flick. One of the satisfying films, despite not a flawless film.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

There's nothing wrong in performances or in writing, directing and production. It's just not so fresh. I felt it trying to be another 'Frances Ha'. For a movie goer like me, this is quite okay film, but for regular people, it could do better.\r\n\r\nThe story of a young woman who just broke up, but focusing more than ever on her dream to be a play writer. In the meantime, she meets another man who recently divorced. Her lifestyle, best friend, all things that's happening around her revealed with some fun. The film was not that great, but surely not a boring film. The dream/imagination sequences spoiled my watch. Because it only brought a false hope. I thought those scenes were better than how the real story progressed. That says, sometimes cliches are okay than being plain. It did not work, but I still suggest to go for it if you are interested. No one should ignore it, only because I did not enjoy it!\r\n\r\n_4/10_"

Do we have a new genre of film – the Docody (can I call a documentary-comedy that, because it sounded better than commedary)?  Is all of this just stranger than fiction?  \r\n\r\nAll of these could be used to describe this film, but there is so much more to George Lazenby's life story... especially the way he tells it...  So, what is it then?\r\n\r\nFirstly, Becoming Bond is not the Thin Blue Line, Grizzly Man, Bowling for Columbine, Citizenfour or any of the Oscar winning documentaries that you've seen.  \r\n\r\nIn Becoming Bond, Lazenby talks about his life, at times brutal honesty and poignancy.  Distilled from about forty hours of interviews, it could be surmised as boy meets girl, boy becomes man, man becomes Bond – but that sells it short.  \r\n\r\nGeorge has lived an interesting life and describes it in equally engaging ways.  What this means for the narrative is that sometimes the truth is not always bland... so much so that 40 minutes in:\r\nDirector: \tHow much of this story that you’ve told me is true?\r\nGeorge:\tWhich one?\r\nDirector: \tThe whole story...\r\nGeorge: \tHey, how can I remember it if it wasn’t true?\r\n\r\nBecoming Bond is made similarly to Touching the Void with actors dramatising parts of the story.  But where that doco was drama, this is more comedic and fittingly, the acting here is playful – reminiscent of the TV series and archetypes of that era (think Batman or the Brady Bunch).  \r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is solid, the directing and editing are sound and the score hints at Bond themes whilst staying individual (much like George's Bond).  Josh Lawson has obvious fun (he picks up George's swagger and little mannerisms well) and little cameos also pepper the film (Jane Seymour, Dana Carvey).  \r\n\r\nOne criticism that can be raised is that the secondary characters are very one dimensional, but I feel this is in line with the narrative of the film – it's George's take on his own life.  \r\n\r\nBecoming Bond is one of the most enjoyable documentaries I've seen.  \r\nIt's not a perfect film; Shakespearianly dramatic; nor is it covering a life changing topic.   \r\n\r\nBut what makes this movie special is that its just how I'd picture it if I happened to have the good fortune to ask George the same questions over a beer or six.  \r\n\r\nAnd thats a credit to both the filmmakers and Lazenby."

It's 4-5 shallow, empty characters with just enough flavor to tell them apart, and I just can't care about them.\r\n\r\nThe movie focuses on the subtly of it all, the growing madness that Slender Man instills in his victims without properly building the tension or showing the characters slowly losing it, which would have given good actors the ability to save it.  Instead they use a lot of \"it happened offscreen\" or sudden cuts to show a lose of time, and we get a character suddenly looking confused instead of taking the audience on a journey with the character.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's not the writing, and maybe the editor just didn't know what they were doing?  \"What are all these long dramatic series in here?  This is so boring!  *cut* Eh, they'll get the point.\"\r\n\r\nWith all the options out there, I just don't think this is worth your time.

Don't expect to be shock like you were when you watched The Exorcist. I’ve read several critic reviews were they just don’t get it. They use words to describe it like “using every trick in the horror trope” or “predictable”, “throwing the kitchen sink at”, or “not enough character development”. Well forget what you heard because there is more bite to this movie than you’d expect. \r\n\r\nOkay, so we begin with a spooky opening sequence where two nuns are fighting to save humanity from a malevolent presence that is about to enter our world. One is dragged into a room and the other commits suicide by hanging. Suicide is a sin, right? Makes you wonder what type of evil is powerful enough to destroy Catholic nuns?\r\n\r\nBeing the beginning of The Conjuring movie universe, this story begins like this, Father Burke (Demién Bichir) is summoned by the Vatican to investigate the suicide of a nun at The Abbey, a castle located somewhere in Romania. Apparently Father Burke has a trauma and a shameful past after having failed to save a teen from an exorcism he performed. Makes you wonder why The Vatican would send a priest like Father Burke on such a dangerous mission. The Vatican doesn’t send Father Burke alone on this task though. They assign Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who hasn’t yet taken her vows. A nun that hasn't taken her vows yet, and not your typical nun either. She's contrary to the average nun. She seems so innocent.\r\n\r\nFather Burke and Sister Irene are taken to The Abbey by a local delivery man, Frechie (Jonas Bloquet). (You may remember Frenchie as the first exorcism performed by The Warrens from the original The Conjuring. Lorraine Warren has the painting of The Nun at their home and references it in the film.) Sister Irene was chosen to go on this assignment because she experiences visions, these visions provide the information needed to uncover what actually occurred at The Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey has been the site of a malevolent force locked away for centuries. The Church took over The Abbey and placed a congregation of nuns to pray 12 hours a day to keep the evil force in control. However, after WW2 bombing weaken the structure of The Abbey, the evil locked inside of it found another way to escape, and using the guise of a nun, slowly grows in strength causing terror on those around it. \r\n\r\nYes, The Nun is a supernatural survival horror installment of The Conjuring universe. You don’t have to be a die hard fan of the horror genre in order to be scared. Yes, there is a lot of the same tropes from the most popular supernatural horror movies and that is because this is how demonic infestation happens. \r\nDirector Corin Hardy and screenplay writer Gary Dauberman do wonderfully.\r\n\r\nWhat this film gives us is tricky camera and visual effects that showcase how the demon works. We find out that the demon’s name is Valak–an ancient demon from Hell that was summoned by the count performed sacrificial rituals. \r\nIf you are expecting character development then you’re not going to find it here. This story doesn’t need a lot of characters at all. You don’t need a lot of information about these characters because Valak is the only character this story is about.. One minute he’s behind the character’s back, the next his shadow appears on the wall, he reanimates dead corpses and even manifesting animals and the usual superhuman strength as well as taking on human form. He ghosts the characters as well. It’s always interesting to see how the director and screenwriter pull off these visual effects. \r\n\r\nFather Burke character plays like a detective searching the castle for any information he can use to exorcise the demonic spirit from the world while Sister Irene uses her visions to lead her to the truth about what occurred at The Abbey as well as discover anything that she can use to send the evil spirit back to Hell. If you like Ash from the Evil Dead horror series, then you’ll like Frenchie because he is the outsider in all of this providing necessary dark humor. Frenchie isn’t afraid to use a shotgun to blow off the heads of a couple of deadites disguised as nuns.\r\n\r\nWhat also makes this film enjoyable to watch with a group, is the pacing. There are enough slow moments for you to make jokes about the characters or the visual bombarding your senses.\r\n\r\nI give this film an enthusiastic 7/10 for its creepy mood and intense disturbing images. And those squeamish people, no worries. There isn't a lot of gore. \r\n\r\nDefinitely a great popcorn horror flick to watch in the dark with your friends. Definitely worth the movie ticket. You won't be disappointed as long as you keep what I've said in this review in mind.\r\nIf I were to rate its place among the other films in The Conjuring universe, I would rate as follows\r\n\r\n1) The Conjuring\r\n2) The Conjuring 2\r\n3) The Nun\r\n\r\n* 4) Annabelle Creation"

Sticking strictly to a formula that will either infuriate or satiate horror genre fans, \"The Nun\" delivers enough creepy boo-jump tropes to keep it above average. There's plenty of roaming about dark corridors and churchyards, with lanterns our only prominent saviours from the terrors of the dark. If, and it's a big if, you don't mind that Corin Hardy's film isn't trying to raise the bar for horror, and is in fact staying safe, then there's a decent enough good time to be had here. If you be one of those who constantly moans about bringing nothing new to the table, don't bother with this one, in fact, think of something new to bring to the table yourselves then... \r\n\r\nThe set-pieces hold up well enough (buried alive shiver shiver), the atmospheric dread only occasionally punctured by Abel Korzeniowski's bombastic score. The story is interesting enough, such as why the entity is bringing terror to the abbey, what is the link to the \"Warren\" family, and the backstory axis for Father Burke (Demián Bichir) brings another demonic layer to the plotting. While talking about \"bringing something new to the table\", for the first time in this series we actually get a bit of humour, mostly from Jonas Bloquet's likable Frenchie character. Taissa Farmiga holds the lead well, where she has a very appealing visual reaction style that will serve her well if she stays in genre mode. While Maxime Alexandre's cinematography (low lights and fogs) is a big improvement from \"Annabelle: Creation\" and is tonally compliant.\r\n\r\nThis formula has been done much better previously, such as Hammer's take on \"The Woman In Black\", but even then they were going on about new stuff being brought to the table etc etc etc. It is what it is, a boo-jump haunted house (buildings) picture that is there for those who like such things, who buy into it on that level. Is this a great film? Absolutely not, but it works on its intended terms and any expectation of a new branch of horror is going to have you crying over spilt blood. 6/10"

Where’d the Monster come from? Etc. And by the end I have no answers and even more questions. Are they gonna survive and kill all the Monsters? Is everyone else dead? Why’d they think to have a baby? But that doesn’t matter.\r\n\r\nWe’re just tossed into this situation with no explanation to almost anything. The only things we really know is of course making lond sounds means you’re likely gonna die. And High Pitch Sounds Hurts the Monster. \r\n\r\nWish is a smart Choice and come to think of it is kinda obvious, maybe a little too obvious. Like how’d they never think about that? Either way. \r\n\r\nA quick note for surviving other then the soundproofing here and there. Why not have a sound bomb of sorts, you could just throw? That would have toldy saved the Dad from having to sacrifice him self. \r\n\r\nThat isn’t to say they’re stupid they had many Smart decisions such a The sand paths, the box for the baby (wish was kinda sad), the little sound proof room, the Radio, and the fireworks. And that’s just the sound related stuff the Lights and Fires Where also Smart.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the cast give us some incredible performances and lots of good chemistry. It probably helps that John and Emily are a real couple. Speaking of wich John Krasinski has Written and Directed a very clever and suspenseful horror film. I’ve never been more scared of corn in my life. Also had jumped at water. \r\n\r\nAnd the sound department specifically the Foley Artist have never shined greater in any film I have ever seen before. The sound is a way flipped from most horror films as it’s when the music drops and everything goes quiet that the Monster attacks. But not in this case everytime the Monster comes it’s a big moment.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have nothing against a R rating. In fact I’m somethimes more likely to see a film because of a R rating, it shows they have gus and they are willing to take a risk. F*ck you MPAA!!! \r\n\r\nAnyways some times all kinds of unnecessary crap is put in a Film because they like oh yeah we’re rated R. Although that’s not always needed this Film proves a well done PG-13 can still be dark and brutal. Killing a Child with in the first 10ish minuets, is a little dark. Although come on that kid had it Coming as soon as he grab those batteries. there’s almost a bit of blood maybe the MPAA is pulling back on some things. Probably not those F*ck you MPAA!!!\r\n\r\nOk sorry my review is getting to become rated R. 😆\r\n\r\nAlso I wanted to note for whatever reason I enjoy films where I can count the entire cast.\r\n\r\nAlong side Get Out it seems people form comedy make better Horror film Directors then most Horror film Directors. It definitely makes sense though it’s all about that timing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Short It was a gripping film from start to finish. I’d highly recommend to all Horror and Thriller Fans. Although because of spoilers in this review you probably already saw it. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo leave a comment and let’s discuss.\r\n\r\nNo likes"

The creatures are nearly indestructible and very effective killers, and once they hear you, you are most likely dead.\r\n\r\nThe movie follows a surviving family trying to keep alive in this harsh reality. The movie setup is incredibly well-built to transpire the precaution, the constant fear, and the direful consequences of an unthought action in this terrible future. **The sound effects are awesome**, and the director can successfully use the nearly-constant silence in contrast to the hassle of being followed by those creatures.\r\n\r\nThe **acting is solid** and helps to immerse the watcher in the well-built plot.\r\n\r\nMy only regret for this movie is that it ends during a climax, when we are not ready to stop watching it yet. **It could be 30 minutes longer** to explain some missing points and to show what happens after the ending.\r\n\r\nOverall, **an awesome movie**, well-thought and beautifully produced in every aspect."

The story is original, no  small feat these days, and the acting is just outstanding!  John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, along with the children, bring these characters to life, and make us really care, all without the benefit of well written dialogue.  That's not easy to do, but they do it.  Right from the start, you find yourself drawn into the lives of these people, and can feel the tension, the undercurrent of threat, that they live with every day.  Through all they face, we are also given a picture of a solid family, with a dad and mom doing everything possible to care for their children, the family praying together, holding onto faith even under the most difficult of circumstances, and that family dynamic really strengthens the entire story.  Who do you rely on when all is changed?  When everything goes wrong?  Family.  Along with the acting, the direction, sets, just everything, come together to deliver a truly scary movie, that doesn't rely on flash to terrify you.  Highly recommend this one.  We saw it in the theater, and bought it as soon as it hit the stores.  Top notch work."

The creatures find prey based on sound so they have to be careful to be quiet at all times. Emily Blunt plays the pregnant mother and John Krasinski her husband (Krasinski also directs).  \r\n\r\n“A Quiet Place” (2018) is a well-made horror flick that brings to mind “Signs” (2002) with ferocious creatures that mix the xenomorphs of “Alien/Aliens” with the extraterrestrials of “War of the Worlds” (2005). They’re basically a knock-off of the monster in “Cloverfield” (2008), albeit the smaller size of the creatures in those previous flicks.\r\n\r\nWhile this movie gets a lot of praise in some circles, the constant mistakes of the family members gets frustrating and tiresome.

        "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nEver since Jordan Peele shocked everyone with his feature directorial debut, Get Out, no one else questioned the potential that a well-known comedic actor could bring to the horror genre. Therefore, I vividly remember discovering that John Krasinski was directing, writing, and starring in a low-budget, original horror flick and feeling incredibly interested, to the point of considering it one of my most anticipated movies of the respective year. I absolutely adore the actor's memorable performance in The Office, but I never really saw anything worth noting from him after that show. Adding Emily Blunt (Sicario, Edge of Tomorrow) - her \"slightly more famous\" wife - was definitely an attention-grabbing move, especially when the young actors were still unknown at the time of release.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Bryan Woods and Scott Beck, Krasinski developed a screenplay based on a relatively simple yet highly impactful, imaginative premise. Creepy, scary monsters who hunt by sound isn't exactly a mind-blowing story aspect, but the extreme amount of tension and suspense transform a regular theater session into a nail-biting, nerve-wracking cinematic experience. Fortunately, the audience at my first screening was really invested in the film, which made for a truly unforgettable moment that I know some people didn't have due to disrespectful moviegoers. However, if there's one thing no one can take away from A Quiet Place is that it works just as well or better watching at home with the lights out in the silence of our own house.\r\n\r\nSome viewers might look at this movie solely as an entertaining horror film with effective jumpscares, shock value, and cool monsters, which are all great attributes. However, the reason why everything works so well is indisputably due to the profoundly well-explored family. Thematically, parenthood and family love are subjects that Krasinski and his team of writers deeply expand upon, primarily through the father-daughter relationship. Being a parent is seen by many as a daunting task, filled with the inevitable fear of not being considered a good father or mother. Lee and Regan's (Millicent Simmonds) difficulties in understanding each other are not only remarkably relatable, but their bond also contributes to some of the most emotional scenes of the movie.\r\n\r\nLee and Evelyn only desire to keep their children safe, but when the world is packed with merciless creatures that kill if a pin drops, some details like having a deaf daughter certainly don't help their mission. They do, however, dial up the levels of tension and suspense to their maximum. Krasinski shows tremendous skill as the director by delivering excruciatingly suspenseful build-ups and exceptionally effective scares. His ability to drastically change the entire mood of a scene offers the viewers several genuinely captivating sequences. Horror-wise, there's plenty to enjoy. From creative atmospheric sequences to jaw-dropping, shocking plot points, A Quiet Place has something for everyone.\r\n\r\nI've addressed Krasinski's work as both director and writer, but he also offers what I believe to be his career-best performance in a feature film. Both he and Emily Blunt perfectly capture the terrifying feeling of living in a post-apocalyptic environment. The protection of their children carries overwhelming despair of losing them to the visually distinct monsters, and both actors shine in their roles. However, my personal standout is Simmonds (Wonderstruck) and Noah Jupe (Honey Boy, Ford v Ferrari). Both were unknown young actors at the original release date, but they steal the spotlight from the big stars. Jupe proves that he has everything to become an Oscar-winner - the demand for him is exponentially rising - and Simmonds delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen from a real-life deaf actress, bringing a great deal of authenticity to her display.\r\n\r\nAll incorporate their characters seamlessly. The interactions between the adult and young actors feel as realistic and honest as possible, also due to the beautifully written screenplay. Technically, I must praise the phenomenal work done with such a low budget. All the way from the shooting location to the sound department, it truly feels like every single person had an essential role in the making of this movie. Not even the monsters are at fault, and there are a couple of close-ups that could have easily been awful, but the VFX artists really step up to the plate and deliver wonderfully horrific creatures. It's well-edited (Christopher Tellefsen), well-shot (Charlotte Bruus Christensen), and the score (Marco Beltrami) is employed just at the right moments.\r\n\r\nI only have one major issue with the film. Story-wise, even though the audience is placed in a fictional world, it feels so real that it's hard to ignore a couple of logical questions regarding the fate of the rest of humanity. These nitpicks don't really bother me, but the ending of the movie still doesn't sit well with me after many viewings. Without spoiling it, of course, the very last shot feels like a cry to Hollywood to make a sequel, which I have to admit is somewhat disappointing. Finally, a film that doesn't belong to cinematic universes or titanic franchises focuses on telling an engaging story with characters worth investing our time on… all to end in a slightly out-of-character moment so more movies can be made?\r\n\r\nA Quiet Place remains emotionally impactful, as well as incredibly suspenseful and tense, even after multiple viewings. Boasting a concept so unique yet so simple, John Krasinski and his fellow co-writers create a profoundly well-explored, character-driven horror story packed with relatable family issues and impressive performances across the board. Through justified shock value and surprisingly investing non-verbal dialogues, this film is one more piece of evidence that the best horror emerges from remarkable character building. The popular actor also proves to be a phenomenal director, generating extreme suspense quickly, drastically altering the entire atmosphere of a scene seamlessly. Technically, it genuinely feels like a low-budget flick where every single department has a noticeable impact on the final product, but the menacing, distinct-looking CGI monsters do steal the spotlight. Despite a few logical issues and an ending that feels more corporate than indie, my love for this movie continues intact. Hopefully, its sequel won't be a disappointment.\r\n\r\nRating: A-"

Emily Blunt and John Krasinski are very good, the pacing is on point (the 90mins fly by) and the monsters are well done.\r\n\r\nHowever, I did find myself questioning a lot of it - and I'm not usually one to notice, or at least criticise, characters being stupid etc. Here, though, it's too obvious - I think the top notch sound, or the lack thereof, actually heightens the flaws, which is unfortunate. From the very start I was like \"Really?!\", as well as at a few other moments - e.g. the nail.\r\n\r\nFirstly with the kid, like rule number one at primary school on field trips is adult at the front, then the kids and then another adult... who leaves the two most vulnerable people at the back in this situation, especially seconds after one of them has almost made a grave error - not even counting the fact that you just walk out the store and leave them alone after the event? Stuff like that, it's annoying that it took me out of it every now and then, I can't lie.\r\n\r\nAs noted though, it is still a fun watch and I'm certainly wanting to check out the sequel. I just don't think I've ever had a film that I enjoy but has such noticeable stupidness, the latter usually outweighs the former - or vice versa. So kudos for that, I guess, Krasinski & Co."

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 rekindled my hope as James Gunn and the cast’s love and passion for these characters shined in every moment of this beautiful, heartfelt send-off. Gunn reminded us of the magic of comic book movies when the storyteller cares more about the characters than the box office. Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, and the rest of the cast pour themselves into entertaining and genuine performances. This film is surprisingly emotional and had me wondering how they convinced me to care so deeply about such a zany group of goofballs, but that they did. Vol. 3 is one of the best conclusions to a film trilogy that had me leave the theater full of satisfaction and nostalgia. While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is wonderful in nearly every way, if I had a complaint, it would be the soundtrack felt forced at times rather than complimenting strong moments in the first film. The villain wasn’t exceptional but was better than the average Marvel villain, and honestly, Vol. 3 wasn’t about the villain or battles as much as it was a farewell to a family of heroes we have all come to love. This movie is well worth your time, and the fantastic effects and cinematography warrant a trip to the cinema to enjoy it to its fullest! MCU doubters need to set aside their skepticism and enjoy saying goodbye to these beloved characters with this outstanding film."

Snag is, \"Rocket\" has been laid low after a rather violent visit from \"Warlock\" (Will Poulter) who is working with his mother to apprehend our ursine pal. \"Quill\" (Chris Pratt) and the others have determined to save him, though, and are soon on the trail of his origins and of a special pass key that could reset him and get him back to fighting fitness. Can the \"Guardians\" put aside their petty differences and unite before it's all too late? This is far too long and it also tries to involve all of the characters in such a fashion as to leave the whole thing with a rather superficial feel to it. Pratt actually features quite sparingly, and that robbed this of much of it's humour and punchiness. The visual effects are great, but that's nothing remarkable with Marvel - they are vivid and colourful but that's no substitute for a well written and characterful narrative that this film simply lacks. It does quite feature quite an engagingly eclectic soundtrack, but the rest of this is terribly unremarkable fayre that I found my self struggling to stay interested in as it meandered more into a realm of sci-fi sentimentality that ensured a minimum of jeopardy in a denouement that featured a fair degree of ham - especially from Iwuji. If this is to be the final instalment, then I fear it will not be one that I will ever bother to watch again. Pity."

Rocket's bittersweet storyline is the soul, heart, and engine running the best MCU film since Spider-Man: No Way Home. It's visually stunning, with exceptional VFX work. The score and soundtrack couldn't be more perfectly matched. Superb performances from the compelling protagonists and even the fun cameos. A better comedy-drama balance than its predecessor, while still offering tons of entertaining sequences. A few minor issues hold it back from standing out as \"one of the greats\", but it was hard to deliver a more satisfying conclusion to this much-beloved trilogy. And also – a final warning to all animal lovers who may find the cruelty displayed on the screen too much for them to enjoy the movie.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-"

Slapstick at best and mostly just annoying. Certainly not very funny a lot of the time. Sure occasionally I did laugh but that was about one out of three times.\r\n\r\nAnd do not get me started about Quill. He’s a stupid, unfunny jerk. He so drags down these movies.\r\n\r\nThe movie does deliver when it comes to one very important aspect of superhero movies though and this is of course the action and special effects. I really liked them and most of my enjoyment of this movie came from this.\r\n\r\nThe story is actually quite okay though and it was kind of cool to get the story about Rocket.\r\n\r\nThe bad guy, well, he is really one of the best parts of this movie. Finally they managed to put together a real bonafide, megalomaniac, psychopathic and genocidal bad guy with lots of (bad) charisma.\r\n\r\nEven if he, despite being a genius in creating all kinds of biological creations, including new species, could not fix his own face instead of wearing a silly latex mask. Seriously? That just the usual dumbass Hollywood script writing.\r\n\r\nOverall though, this was a fun, special effects loaded, action roller coaster and, surprisingly enough when it comes to Marvel, not loaded with woke preaching.\r\n\r\nAnd it was cool to see Sylvester Stallone again even if it was just briefly.\r\n\r\nIf they had toned down the silliness, or gotten someone intelligent to write the jokes, it would have gotten another star from me."

I have read so many reviews that have described the character of Leah as angst-ridden.  Angst is fear or anxiety, often about the future, it is not the same thing as anger...\r\n\r\nLeah is a teen living with her grieving mother.  She likes black metal and the occult.  She's not completely off the rails, still respects her mother, but she is clearly dealing with the loss of her father as is her mother.  Her mum decides it is time to uproot from the family home and shift to a cabin in the woods.  After a massive argument the angry teen summons a demon/witch/entity to kill her mum, and spends the rest of the film regretting and trying to reverse the ritual.\r\n\r\nThere's some good acting, some nicely fleshed out characters with a lot of grey moral areas, no one is completely good or completely bad.  The mother is simultaneously cold, selfish, distant, loving, caring and concerned.  The daughter is angry, upset, respectful and loving.  \r\n\r\nThe witch is a little like the shark in jaws, all subtle out of focus, with only the odd decent look at it.  That is both a good and a bad thing.  Fans of horror might feel let down, but fans of thrillers might think it is all a little too much\r\n\r\nThere are some monumentally bad decisions which are hard to get over, and the ending lacked some punch, but it is mostly a well made quiet film.\r\n\r\n6/10"

As it is, though, the more interesting aspects of the plot are seriously undercooked; it takes far too long for us to get going and the quality of the acting and the dialogue - pretty much across the board - is nothing special.

It's not worth quoting examples, anyone reading this has probably seen at least ten movies about serial killers. This is one more, based on original Scandinavian material that I've never seen, but I'd like to see it, and I'll try to find it. Honestly, I hope it's better than the movie I just saw...\r\n\r\nThe film is not bad. Don't get me wrong. It has a good base premise: murders that imitate famous works of art all over Europe, with the father of one of the victims desperately trying to catch the culprit. But it's not at all original, it does the same things that we're tired of seeing in established films, and it doesn't manage to go beyond the usual recipe to offer us something that makes it stand out. And there is a huge problem that partially ruins the film: we discover the identity of those who are killing people too soon and, from there, it is only worth watching the film to see how the police will hunt down their target.\r\n\r\nJeffrey Dean Morgan is a very solid and competent protagonist, able to commit himself and give the character the consistency and anguish that it demands. Undoubtedly, the actor's performance is a bonus in the film. Despite being heavily criticized, I think Famke Janssen wasn't that bad. She does have depressing moments and sometimes goes overboard, but she gives us a relatively satisfying job, and doesn't have many opportunities to really fail. Joachim Krol seems to be out of place and lost. Naomi Battrick is quite good, taking into account that she is not a frontline actress and has handled a character who demands a certain charisma and attitude; Ruairi O’Connor, honestly, cannot say he is happy, he erases himself even in scenes where he is more visible.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it's a regular film without great merits, but it doesn't fail too much either: the European settings and landscapes, always pleasant no matter how commonplace they may be, are joined by standard cinematography and ordinary work on the costumes. Some well-crafted effects and a lukewarm soundtrack make for a cohesive and functional, if forgettable, whole."

Creative and fresh subjects are the reasons they are succeeding. For the past couple of years I have been watching some awesome B movies and this is one of those. It was not quite great, because of borrowing some of the usual Tamil film formulas. Like the songs which were totally unblendable with the story narration. And then the love story, which is a must in Tamil films, particularly to add romance tracks which again takes us to the point one.\r\n\r\nApart from those small flaws, I liked the film. Those second string and supporting actors had their dream roles. To identify their performance, they never had such focused character in their career. I'm taking about particularly MS Bhaskar. He might have played a negative role, but it is his career best performance. I've seen him in the hundreds of blockbusters, but never like this. Then the new faces, they were not bad. But in some places, it is easy to recognise their inexperience, especially while delivering the lines and expressions. While watching the film, you should stop counting the bullets as I did, because that's not how it goes. It has a different explanation for the title.\r\n\r\nThe film was about an orphan boy who was wrongly accused of a crime and then after he grew up, he became a police officer. I didn't know, a crime offender can become a police. Anyway, he's so innocent for the job. Meets a girl and while his life was going smoothly, he becomes terrified when he loses the department gun. Following the event, he closely investigates the bank robbery which could be linked to his lost gun. So if that's true, who's behind it and how to come out of the situation comes next.\r\n\r\nVery nice storyline, but it should have been 90 minute film. An additional hour was a drag. At least how it looked when the first stage of the development came to cease. In the second half, the focus shifted to the film's negative role. All his history was briefed for our understanding. I thought that parts were intentional and leans towards the sentiments. So when it comes the finale and prior to it, kind of unpredictable, yet compromise in places to knot all the threads together for a perfect conclusion. Nicely done, only keeping in the mind the native audience, but if you are into world cinema, then it is just an okay flick. Still a good film to try once, so I recommend it.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

Never has a film from the cinematic universe been so violent, bloody, and terrifying.\r\n\r\nBenedict Cumberbatch and especially Elizabeth Olsen carry the complex story about the multiverse through Michael Waldron's flawed screenplay. The balance between the various storylines could be better, America Chavez is just one MacGuffin to reach another MacGuffin, and the journey through the multiple universes only compensates for the mind-blowing visual effects.\r\n\r\nSome personal disappointment is associated with the cameos treatment and the lack of real-location filming.

The story is really pretty thin with the engaging and confident Benedict Cumberbatch joining forces with the charismatic and feisty young Xochitl Gomez' \"America\" - a young lady who has been appearing in his dreams. Turns out, she can cross from one universe to another - and soon both are being sought by the mighty Elizabeth Olsen's \"Wanda Maximoff\" (surely a \"Bond\" girl?) who wants control of time so she can get back to her lost family, yada yada... Benedict Wong features sparingly, but always adds a little value as the \"Sorcerer Supreme\" and there are a few cameos from Charlize Theron and Sir Patrick Stewart to help prop up what is, admittedly, a pretty meagre second half. I think this multiverse strand could provide Marvel with the gift that keeps on giving, but they have got to tighten the pace up - two hours for this was just too long; the plot doesn't sustain it and though the combat scenes are nothing to the length in the \"Avengers\" movies; there is still far too much slack here. It does look and sound great on a big screen, though, and I am now warming to the star in the role (and his intuitive flying cape). Fun, but flawed."

Now if you haven’t seen the film yet this may count as a spoiler, though it is revealed fairly early on. But the former heroine turned evil one is a woman taken over by the dark side. But what got me was her motive. Not to take over the world or the universe or the multiverse, but rather because she wanted to be a mommy to kids she lost along the way, or never had, or something. Billions of people in multiple universes died because she didn’t want to adopt. \r\n\r\nIt seems like inserting herself into one universe might have been enough for you or me, but I suppose she wanted more options open if something went wrong with the first kids whose mother she killed (or is it her alternate self?) to get hold of. Dr. Strange even asked about it once, and she blithely explained that if her new old kids got terribly sick, she could find the cure for anything in other universes. She is the perfect mom, doing anything for her kids; well, except for providing moral leadership and showing them the path to be a good person who helps others and contributes to the world around them.

As usual it is a mix of action, suspense and comedy relief and Marvel has actually managed to get a decent balance in this movie. Doctor Strange stays competent throughout the movie and although Wong is sometimes a bit silly it is not too bad. There is little of the unintelligent slapstick “comedy” that Marvel sometimes pollute their movies with.\r\n\r\nI have to say that the main bad guy, Wanda the Scarlet Witch, was a bit mediocre though. Sure, when she let loose with her magic it was generally cool but, to me, she lacked real bad guy charisma.\r\n\r\nAt times the movie became a rather violent actually. Although there was no real gore in it, the way Wanda disposed of some of the heroes in the alternate universe was somewhat brutal. Also the alternate universe undead Doctor Strange was almost horror movie material.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line, for me, is that overall this was a very good movie."

Tim Misuradze plays a neighbor of the writer while Chris Lazzaro is on hand as a dubious friend of the protagonist (Walther).\r\n\r\n\"Murder on the Cape\" (2017) is a very low-budget crime drama by Arthur & Heather Egeli loosely based on the real-life 2002 murder of Christa Worthington, a 46-year-old fashion writer, in Truro, Massachusetts, near the tip of Cape Cod.\r\n\r\nThe strengths of the movie are the ravishing Jade Harlow, the masculine protagonist reminiscent of Jason Momoa (Walther), the nice Cape Cod scenery and the compelling story. The weaknesses are a script that needed the kinks worked out and some presumably local actors who act like they learned their lines 15 minutes before shooting.\r\n\r\nIf you like crime dramas based on real-life events the movie’s worth checking out as long as you can handle very low-budget Indies; then compare it with the real-life events. I was able to acclimate and enjoy the movie despite its shortcomings. The numerous reviewers who rate it 1/10 are obviously not used to seeing limited-budget productions.

        "content": "There's a lot to cover here. Bruce Parry's latest foray into tribal exploration goes further than the usual appeals to civilisation's lost sense of unity with the world. Don't get me wrong, it's there, making up the titular theme (Tawai literally translates to a relationship with nature), and categorising, for the first half or so, the film's primary message. But thereafter Parry takes an interesting turn, focusing on the psychological and sociological aspects of certain tribes in Borneo and the Amazon. Parry's thesis is that after the invention of agriculture sometime in the neolithic, and the subsequent abandonment of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, human psychology, specifically the way we perceive and relate to the world around us, changed forever. Parry uses these nomadic tribes, still employing the hunter-gatherer way of life, as case studies to back up his claim. He also consults with experts in tribal sociology and neuroscience who posit corroborating ideas. And a third angle is seen through the lens of eastern philosophy, mindfulness and the illusion of self. Parry draws parallels between all three sections seemingly building a strong argument for a \"better way of life\": a right-hemisphere dominated (we in the west predominantly use the left), purely egalitarian, selfless existence. But with closer inspection the foundations appear weak: anecdotal accounts from tribes people are just exactly that; sociological structures are analysed and commended without any considerations for how they'd work in populations over 30; and the neuroscience (which I'm obviously not qualified to comment on) comes from one professional, which even by his own proclamation appears to be a fringe theory. And as far as my limited understanding goes, eastern philosophy has commanded authority only in 'spiritual' wisdom (philosophy of mind etc.) over the centuries, whereas the west is far superior scientifically, politically and ethically, build upon the ideas of the enlightenment. The film's lack of acknowledgement of this asymmetry worries me, even going as far as to portray the east as the superior. But the fact still stands, by every conceivable metric of human well being—life expectancy, child mortality, literacy etc.—living in the west is the best in the world. Nuggets of wisdom found in eastern tradition, buried beneath their many layers of sectarian mysticism, should be respected for what they are. And lessons about our relationship with the world from people living directly off it should too. But a loss of perspective can turn small lessons into large errors, mistaking a voice from the forest for a call back to it. \r\n\r\nI like plumbing."

I didn't notice the shaky camera work that others have commented on, and even though in my own novels I take pride in creating realistic dialogue, I had no problem with the dialogue here that bugged still others.

It didn't seem very effective to me, so perhaps a bit more subtlety might have been less of a distraction to the viewer.\r\n\r\nThis movie is based on a newer biography that offers an alternate description of the painter's last few years.

It has its heart in the right place, but as a film I didn't enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe main thing that bothered me was the camera work all around, just absolutely needless shaky cam that adds zero to what's going on onscreen - it even distracts from the main event, for me at least. It is noted that, away from that, visibly the film does look neat.\r\n\r\nI am admittedly not into art ('twas my least favourite subject at school, in fact), though even so I expected more from this. I am happy for Dafoe that this was positively received as his showing merits high praise, but it won't be one I'll be revisiting any time soon personally."

One thing he hates in his career is drug business, but the rival gang wants him to join with them so they can sneak it without any problem.\r\n\r\nBut, Maari strongly opposes the plan. Meantime, there is Beeja also known as Thanatos (Tovino Thomas) who has vengeance against Maari for killing his brother. When Beeja escapes from jail, he works with Maari’s rivals and plans a cunning scheme to separate Maari from Kalai.\r\n\r\nBeeja’s idea works well and he nearly kills Maari and his lover Aarathu Aanandhi (Sai Pallavi). But they abscond, get married and settles in Tenkasi to lead a peaceful life. But situation forces Maari to return back to his area once again to finish off his rivals.\r\n\r\n‘Maari 2’ has all masala ingredients needed for a commercial film. The first half highly depends on Dhanush’s character, but this film is packed with action, romance, friendship, father-son bond, comedy, and all other required ingredients. Especially, the emotional sequences are something no one expect in ‘Maari’ series.\r\n\r\nSource: KollywoodZone.com"

You knew there was something not quite right, but no idea what. I couldn't even be certain the angle they were gonna play up was Octavia Spencer as a villain. Then every bit of marketing material afterwards showed the hand almost immediately. Ma's a headcase no doubt about it and that great act 2 twist we had waiting in the wings was ruined. Then I actually watched the thing, and, no, it's totally fair, because the escalation on her craziness is pretty much complete by the end of day 1. Things from the first trailer that I thought could maybe sow of doubt towards making the audience dubious about her intentions, in the actual movie take place **after** she's already commited murder in broad daylight. So my expectations were off, that's on me. All that aside though, _Ma_ really isn't that great. It is okay, not terrible by any stretch, but probably doesn't merit a revisit. Octavia Spencer's character does provoke both genuine sympathy, and an overwhelming creep-factor, and hitting those two opposing aspects is quite impressive, but there is so much that _Ma_ completely drops, it almost feels unfinished.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"

        "content": "West Side story: Gritty morality tale with an emotional punch. 85%\r\n\r\nNot having seen the stage production of \"West Side story\" or its first film version, which I understand is regarded as a classic, I really don't have a point of comparison for this new film version of the long-running musical theatre staple. Of course, with the US being so effective at exporting its pop culture around the world, I was aware of songs and scenes from the original Hollywood film, which had positive associations for me, even though I live in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe story was inspired by a much earlier tale, which I won't mention here because...spoilers. In any case, the second film version (presumably...at least as far as US film versions go) of this story is set in a slum in New York in the 1950s (the \"West Side\" of the title). The setting is very nicely established, with an opening shot of some partially destroyed buildings which a sign states are being demolished to make way for the gentrification of the area. The flats in the high-rise buildings nearby have a suitably \"slummy\" look without the aesthetic being overdone. From out of this no man's land emerges what turns out be a gang of Anglo background, known as \"The Jets\". You can tell that they they are bad because they soon terrorise the neighbourhood with dancing and singing, with no one daring to stop them. It has to be said, at this point, the realisation of a musical in the modern era hasn't lost my interest. Fit young blokes dancing and singing and clicking their fingers in time in the streets of a big city doesn't seem all that ridiculous now.\r\n\r\nWe soon learn that The Jets have a rival group which they want to remove from 'their turf', a gang known as \"The Sharks\", which are of Puerto Rican ethnicity. The basis of The Jets' animosity to The Sharks is basically an issue of race (and that is also the basis of the police department's animosity towards The Sharks as well). The Sharks do not 'belong' in the US and they should 'go back to where they came from'. The first encounter we see between these two rival gangs is a violent one and it's pretty clear that things will escalate from here between them.\r\n\r\nIf you're thinking that nothing thrown into this tinderbox could make it any more flammable, well...enter Tony (played by Ansel Elgort) and Maria (Rachel Zegler). Tony is the co-founder of The Jets but after a stint in prison for a shocking beating he gave to an Eyptian man, he is trying to be a better person, now holding down a steady job and no longer involved in his gang's activities. Maria is the sister of Bernardo (David Alvarez), a man who is trying to fight his way out of the slum (literally). Bernardo has a chip on his shoulder about the Anglos, who make life difficult for his community. He plays the father-figure at the flat that he shares with his girlfriend and Maria. The prospect of Maria dating a \"gringo\" is unacceptable to him, as we later find out when...Tony and Maria meet at a dance event and...instantly fall in love. He is also the leader of The Sharks.\r\n\r\nThat moment when Tony and Maria fall in love at first sight is very sweetly done. Maria, as played by Zegler, seems like an old-fashioned Disney princess at first, being very timid but then being quite forward...perhaps like a (modern day?) Disney princess? (Since I'm not well-versed in Disney films about princesses, I'll have to defer to the judgement of people more informed than me on this subject.) The lyric from the song \"Hurts so good\" by John Cougar comes to mind about her: \"you ain't as green as you are young\". Zegler/Maria is very attractive in a winsome way. Director Steven Spielberg has really captured a winning performance from her. It occurred to me after writing down my initial thoughts on this film that Zegler would be a worthy nominee for \"Best actress\" at awards time. Even though I haven't really seen many 'quality' films this year, I think I know a quality performance when I see one and I don't think that a best actress award for her would be undeserved.\r\n\r\nIf you think that Maria couldn't be any more adorable, well, you should hear her sing. She has a lovely voice, in my view. To me, she's the standout voice of the musical. Elgort tends towards falsetto at times. On the subject of the music, I'd say that I'm pretty sure that if you just wanted to listen to the musical on CD or whatever, then there would be better versions of that from previous productions of this story, whether on stage or screen. By that I mean perhaps the music elsewhere is bolder, brassier or arranged more pleasingly (to my ears, at least) and that would apply to the vocal performances as well. However, since I haven't heard other versions, I can't recommend one for you.\r\n\r\nIt also later occurred to me how similar Tony and Bernardo are (which I've retrospectively alluded to in my earlier comments about how both of them plan to get out of the slum). Another point of comparison with Bernardo would be The Jets' new leader, \"Riff\" (Mike Faist). They both mirror each other as far as attitudes to \"the other\" goes.\r\n\r\nIn any case, just when Tony thought he was out, Riff pulls him back in again, as far as gang activities go.\r\n\r\nI liked this film and had moments of recognition with it, with regards to clicking fingers and many songs. One event which did jar with me was how Maria reacted to Tony when she heard some fateful news about him. It just didn't ring true to me. Maybe with a greater passage of time it could have worked. Later, when the police officer goes over the whole timeline, the short duration was a shock too.\r\n\r\nThe film was on track for a score of 80% from me but since the drama near the end of the film elicited emotion from me, I added another 5% to my score to reflect that.\r\n\r\nRandom notes:\r\n\r\n*Is the ending different to previous versions of this story? If it is, you can either read it as a return to sanity as far as character motivation goes or as a Steven Spielberg tendency.\r\n\r\n*There is some realism to the violence, so not suitable for very young children, I don't think.\r\n\r\n*I couldn't quite tell if there was some strong swearing at times or if it was toned down.\r\n\r\n*Curios: 5c for a Milky Way chocolate bar, $15 for a fashionable store scarf, I think."

His role is simply too large to be ignored and impossible to compare to his co-stars’ formidable, sublime performances."

        "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nIn case you don't know, I'm from Portugal. Why does this matter? Well, The Hunt was delayed after a massive shooting in the USA, and since the movies' themes are extremely sensitive, the producers decided to postpone the film. At the time, I felt frustrated that, once again, movies have to suffer from real-life situations. Going to the theater is supposed to be an \"out of this world\" experience. The audience is transported into a fictional place where real-world problems can be forgotten for a couple of hours. So, I never handled these constant controversies surrounding films very well...\r\n\r\nWith that said, I believe The Hunt not only benefited from that delay, but its satirical story has even more impact now. There's no way around this. Craig Zobel's movie is meant to be one of the most divisive films of the last few years. I know it's a pretty basic analogy, but it's just like a dark humor standup show. If you don't have any issues with jokes about topics like racism, stereotypes, immigration, refugees, religion, politics, and every sensitive theme that your mind can imagine, then you'll find The Hunt a brilliant allegory of society's most extreme people. If you do have problems with this type of comedy, then stay away from this movie because Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse go all out!\r\n\r\nWhen I write that every remotely sensitive taboo subject or activity is unrestrainedly addressed, I mean EVERY SINGLE theme. This is a narrative completely packed with extreme, over-the-top cliches and stereotypes of both right and left political sides. At first glance, The Hunters feel like the \"bad guys\", in the sense that they're hunting innocent people for pure pleasure. Once the audience understands the reasons behind the selection of the people being hunted, one small but tremendously effective thought enters everyone's mind: \"you know what... the world would actually be a better place without this kind of people\".\r\n\r\nSuddenly, not a single character is worth caring about. To clarify, I don't mean \"caring about\" in the common, emotional way. No character is written with the purpose of making the audience worry about it. In fact, almost every character (maybe except Betty Gilpin's) is a despicable human being. Their view of the world is clouded by ideologically outdated mentalities. I love how the screenwriters use each character to represent a particular type of ... extreme personality, let's call it that. One of the best compliments I can give the film is that it didn't pick a side. Everyone gets blasted with jokes.\r\n\r\nIt's a dark yet hilarious satire of today's society with a special focus on the close-minded people that go online to try and spread their conspiracy theories and immoral beliefs. Everything that I just wrote so far resembles the movie's impact on the viewer: either you're okay with this type of screenplay and you'll be incredibly entertained; or you'll get extremely triggered by all this. It's one of those films that will end up on a bunch of \"Worst Movies of 2020\" lists simply due to its narrative's nature.\r\n\r\nHowever, the story isn't the only aspect that can make people give up on watching this movie. The actual hunt is as over-the-top as everything else. There's blood everywhere, ridiculously disgusting deaths, and absolutely no limits whatsoever in killing people in the most insanely entertaining way possible. Action-wise, The Hunt is better filmed than a lot of blockbusters. Beautiful wide shots when something (or someone) explodes, exceptional (and hilariously long) choreography for the \"final fight\", and excellent editing overall. It's genuinely a well-made, well-produced, and well-filmed movie. The score is also pretty cool.\r\n\r\nObviously, it's one of those films that's easy to pinpoint flaws. Every single paragraph that I wrote above can be interpreted as some of the worst aspects of the entire movie, depending on each person's perspective. In my opinion, I think the ending would have benefited from a more serious tone, but at the same time, it would probably clash with the widespread satirical one, so it's an inevitably difficult ending to completely get right. The cast is a bit hit-and-miss when it comes to each actor's performance (some are very bland), but Betty Gilpin delivers an outstanding display and seamlessly carries the whole film. Finally, there's a small part of the movie that involves military characters who don't belong to either side of The Hunt, and that portion didn't really work for me.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Hunt is a brilliantly dark satire on today's political views of the world. It's meant to be one of the most divisive films of the last few years, and it undoubtedly succeeds in its mission. Just like dark humor, either you're okay with it, or you're not. If you can't take a joke about the most extremely sensitive taboo themes (and I mean ALL of them), then stay away from this movie or you'll be triggered for a whole week. However, if you can see the fun side of this type of comedy, The Hunt is the most entertaining, witty, hilarious, bloody, over-the-top action thriller you'll see for a long time. Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse go all out, and they don't forget to approach a single topic. It's a well-made film all-around: well-written, well-produced, and well-filmed. A few minor issues regarding its ending and a small subplot don't diminish Craig Zobel's exceptionally captivating concept and Betty Gilpin's compelling performance. I definitely recommend it depending on how much you enjoy dark humor.\r\n\r\nPS: everyone knows the tale about the rabbit and the turtle, right? How the rabbit races the turtle, and all that? Well, The Hunt's version of that story just became my all-time favorite.\r\n\r\nRating: A-"

        "content": "> Review From **_Horror Focus_**\r\n\r\nGaining its momentum back in mid 2019, The Hunt stirred up quite a bit of controversy prior to its initial release, branding it too brutal for release due to the mass shootings in Ohio, Texas last summer. This Blumhouse picture was later rescheduled, and was at one point never to see the light of day, which would have been a crushing blow knowing how relevant this actually turned out to be. Luckily for us, Blumhouse soon caught on and realised movies like The Hunt are exactly what our cruel audience’s need right now, something with a sharp satirical bite with a gut-punching narrative reflective of modern society. Welcome to my favourite horror movie of the past few years.\r\n\r\nImagine a Twitter thread was made into a movie, this is The Hunt. What we have here is a film that functions on the confliction that exists in the real-world between liberals and conservatives, as they take chunks out of each other when discussing politics online, spilling blood on each side as opinions and views are torn to shit by the opposing party. What is depicted is literal death and carnage, which is representative of how the different identities and political views that are one person's beliefs, but another’s infuriating joke.\r\nImage result for the hunt 2020 film\r\nThe beauty here (which is addressed as a massive concern to most reviewers) is the lack of depth to these characters within The Hunt, and to their lifestyle choices and political standpoints. What works best is that it never takes a stance when mocking both sides of the political spectrum, and allows us as an audience to identify which whatever our political views lead us to, even if one side is draped in murderous overtones. I admire how we are left to decide where we would stand, and if what is happening is something we can sympathise with. To most, what I’m saying sounds ridiculous, but this lack of depth to these characters is very much reflective on the current state of our social media, having people who we know nothing about spreading their views which are toxic to half and relatable to others.\r\n\r\nIt’s that online façade that is at play here, as we witness comments and statements daily that tear down others, ruin people’s professional statuses or simply to spread offensive and insensitive comments online to troll others. This is the world we live in, and the characters in The Hunt exist within our real world. The characters within this may not be fleshed out, but to the online profiles with nothing but a name, a picture and a flurry of controversial tweets neither are they, and that certainly looks like modern day humanity to me.\r\n\r\nMuch of The Hunt’s satirical sting comes from its reliance on our current climate and political correctness, which leans on its accurate depiction of society to get its laughs in when it can. It’s understandable that this particular sense of humour might to a little too one-note for some, but it firmly has its own tongue planted in its cheek when openly mocking our current way of thinking, juxtaposing these characters with opposing mind-sets to create a genuinely clever and on-the-nose depiction on humanity’s contemporary views. Aside from the intelligent links to modern society, it’s also really enjoyable and highly entertaining when utilised to its full potential. One could be offended by some of the humour here, but when the film itself jokes on our own generation of snowflakes, it begs the question if The Hunt is pointing the finger at you, and calling you out for being said snowflake. It all really works for me on a sharply pungent level, one that had me tickled pink until the final credits. The Hunt ultimately holds up a darkly comedic mirror up to the political divisions in a way that hasn’t been explored to this stature.\r\nImage result for the hunt 2020\r\nThe action here is outstanding, with the violence being the appropriate level of over the top to match its exuberant premise. Betty Giplin is undeniably outstanding as she delivers a powerhouse of a performance in her portrayal of Crystal, a tough as nails heroine who easily establishes herself in the ranks next to such genre greats as Erin from You’re Next and Alien’s Ripley. Her level of badass is contagiously ferocious, making every scene she’s in an absolute blast to witness. Each fight scene is crafted brilliantly, looking seamlessly effortless with its high-energy intensity, most notably when we reach our final act in which our Million Dollar Baby Hillary Swank comes head-to-head with Giplin, which can only be described as one of the most entertaining fight scenes in recent horror memory.\r\n\r\nNothing is ever fully dripping in suspense, but you soon realise it doesn’t need to be when you’re watching enigmatic fight scenes that are as vicious as they are diverting. The film also works its best when it plays at its most unexpected, knocking familiar faces off like Drew Barrymore in Scream level of unexpected in ways so gleefully gory it will have you laughing with sheer shock. The Hunt may split audiences right down the middle, but there is one thing that is universal, and that’s that Betty Giplin’s Crystal is already this decades best Final Girl.\r\n\r\nVERDICT \r\nProving to be one of the strongest contemporary social and political horror movies in recent memory, The Hunt is a lean, mean, fighting machine that is as sharply satirical as it is viciously violent. Make room for Betty Giplin, our new final girl is in town.\r\n\r\n★★★★★"

Benjamin Sisko; Final words of \"In the Pale Moonlight\" (first aired, April 15, 1998)\r\n\r\nPremiering in syndication on January 3, 1993 and ending with the broadcast of its 176th episode on June 2, 1999, the thing that I loved most about _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ was the very thing that made Trekkies hate it - it just didn't feel like _Star Trek_. At least, not entirely. The Gene Roddenberry-created _Star Trek: The Original Series_ (1966-1969) and _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ (1987-1994) were both shows built around idealism, depicting how by the time of the 23rd and 24th centuries, humanity had put aside its petty squabbles, created global political harmony, and even done away with money, with Earth itself now a veritable utopia. Meanwhile, the human-led United Federation of Planets were very much the good guys, with Starfleet as the always-honourable, morally irreproachable _de facto_ police force of the galaxy, facing off against the nefarious Klingons, Romulans, Gorn, Tholians, Ferengi, Borg etc. They were shows about exploration and diplomacy, but above all, they were shows about optimism, about how humanity can rise above any adversity, about how hope should never be lost.\r\n\r\nAnd then came _Deep Space Nine_, or, to use a moniker originally intended as derogatory, but which has since been appropriated as a badge of honour by the show's makers and fans, \"dark _Star Trek_\". And what was so dark about it? Well, by way of illustration, let's look at the sixth season episode \"In the Pale Moonlight\", regarded by some (myself included) as the finest hour of the entire _Star Trek_ franchise, and by others as the episode where _DS9_ most egregiously violated the edicts of Roddenberry's creation. Deep into the Dominion War, (the concept of a prolonged and costly war, in and of itself, was fairly antithetical to the idealism of the franchise), the Federation and the Klingon Empire had been getting their asses handed to them for months by the Dominion (again, in Roddenberry's original conception, the good guys rarely lost). With the Romulans reluctant to get involved in a conflict that has little to do with them, they are tending towards a wait-and-see approach. However, Starfleet knows that if the war continues along the same lines for much longer, there will be no way back. And so, in an effort to ensure the Romulans enter the war, Captain Benjamin Sisko (the legendary Avery Brooks) lies, cheats, cajoles, and is a party to murder. And if that isn't bad enough, not only does he admit in his personal log that he would do it all again if he had to, he then erases the log entirely. This was psychological territory totally alien to Trekkies, raising the kind of moral questions one simply never encountered when dealing with such idealised characters as James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). This was some seriously dark material. This was not _Star Trek_.\r\n\r\nAnd, on that point, I agree. This was not _Star Trek_. This was better.\r\n\r\nAlthough created by Rick Berman and Michael Piller, the real creative force behind _DS9_ was executive producer and lead writer Ira Steven Behr. With Berman and Piller focusing their attention on _Star Trek: Voyager_ (1995-2001), from _DS9_'s third season onwards, Behr was essentially left to his own devices (and if _DS9_ is \"dark _Star Trek_\", _VOY_ is \"_Star Trek_ for kids\"). And, much like Michael Mann's involvement with _Miami Vice_, you can almost pinpoint the exact moment when Behr took hold of the reins (although in the case of _Miami Vice_, it was a dramatic dip in quality upon Mann's departure). From the last episode of the second season (\"The Jem'Hadar\"), Behr and his exceptional team of writers (Robert Hewitt Wolfe, Ronald D. Moore, Hans Beimler, and René Echevarria) would set about crafting a pioneering show that did things and went places not only unique for the _Star Trek_ franchise, but unique for syndication entirely. Long before the Second Golden Age of Television, _DS9_ occupied a fascinating middle-ground between the episodic storytelling of _TNG_ and the serialisation format employed by most shows today. Indeed, it has more in common with today's binge-worthy long-form narratives than with any of its contemporaries. This is one of the reasons why it has proved so popular on Netflix in recent years - it lends itself to watching six or seven episodes at a time so as to get a better sense of the overarching narrative tapestry, a tapestry which _TOS_, _TNG_, and _VOY_ simply didn't have. Often criticised at the time (if you missed even one episode, especially in the heavily serialised last two seasons, you could easily get lost), this style of storytelling is exactly what's expected by people who've never known life without streaming, and partly because of this, the show has aged extremely well.\r\n\r\nAll of which brings us to _What We Left Behind: Looking Back at Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, a partly fan-funded documentary directed by Behr and David Zappone. The documentary is built around three core components; the cast and crew looking back at their time on the show (often very emotionally), a writers' room mapping out the first episode of a hypothetical eighth season (which ends up sounding awesome), and everyone from military vets to clergy to TV producers to human rights campaigners to professors of history discussing just how ahead of its time the show really was. And thankfully, the documentary is absolutely superb, and something no _DS9_ fan can possibly miss.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Behr announced that he had reassembled most of the cast and many of the crew for an as-yet unnamed documentary. Partly complete, he explained that they were lacking sufficient funds to scan the original camera negatives and convert them to HD. With the documentary featuring 22 minutes of original clips, Behr explained they were only planning to convert a couple of minutes, with the rest being left in their original broadcast 480i format. Setting up an Indiegogo fundraising page to crowdsource the rest of the capital, the fund surpassed its target of $150,000 less than 24 hours after going live. Going on to raise over $631,000, the documentary team ultimately decided to convert all 22 minutes of original footage.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to an important point that I simply can't over-emphasise; it's worth the price of admission just for these 22 minutes. _TOS_ and _TNG_ have already had their 1080p conversions, but _DS9_ has only ever been seen in 480i, even on Netflix. With that in mind, the documentary offers a unique opportunity, possibly the only opportunity fans will ever get to see parts of the show in full HD (in 2017, Treknews.net published a fascinating interview with Robert Meyer Burnett, who was in charge of the _TOS_ and _TNG_ Blu-rays, where he explains in great detail why it's unlikely _DS9_ or _VOY_ will ever be converted to HD for any medium). Obviously, the space stuff looks truly amazing, with the epic battle scenes from \"Sacrifice of Angels\" standing up against anything you'd see in a big-budget movie in terms of scope and elaborateness. However, even the smaller character moments really pop - the colours are so much richer (especially the reds and blues in the uniforms), the blacks and shadows so much deeper, the makeup more nuanced, the subtlety of background detail more noticeable.\r\n\r\nIn a roundtable with Behr, Zappone, and producer/editors Joseph Kornbrodt and Luke Snailham, shown after the screening I attended, even Jonathan West, the show's director of photographer from the third season on, is shown as being amazed at how good the original footage looks after the conversion process. And not only is it in HD, it's also in 16:9. Like _TNG_, _DS9_ was originally shot on 35mm before being converted to video for editing, and broadcast at 1.33:1. However, unlike _TNG_, _DS9_ was framed to protect for widescreen (meaning that although it was shot with the intention of being converted to 1.33:1, so too was it composed as if widescreen was the intended goal). The same is true of _The Wire_, which was broadcast at 1.33:1, but converted to 1.78:1 for its Blu-ray release, a process made easier by the fact that it was shot to protect for widescreen. And as anyone who has seen _The Wire_'s magnificent 1080p/1.78:1 conversion will attest, the difference is night and day. In the roundtable, there are some split-screen comparisons between the clips as they originally aired and as they appear in the documentary, and it's like watching a completely different show. It's definitely my inner nerd coming out, but some of the footage gave me goosebumps. Literally.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with the cast reading extracts from some of the criticisms aimed at the show in its early years - mainly revolving around the fact that it wasn't _TOS_ or _TNG_, that it was too dark and morally ambiguous, that it wasn't as good as _Babylon 5_ (the temerity!), that it was on a station instead of a ship (how could it \"boldly go\" when it couldn't go anywhere, boldly or otherwise), that there were too many non-Starfleet characters, that the characters were too flawed. And whilst these criticisms are played for laughs, Behr and Zappone don't shy away from looking at some of the more painful moments - Avery Brooks being forbidden from having a goatee and a shaved head, so as not to appear, to quote then Paramount Television chairman Kerry McCluggage, \"_too street_\" (as Behr points out, \"_we were expecting Avery Brooks, one of the coolest cats on the planet, and instead we got the boring dad version of Avery Brooks_\"); Rick Berman not understanding why Behr wanted to introduce a war storyline, and later complaining that the show had become too violent (leading to Ronald D. Moore's famous rejoinder, \"_it's a fucking war! What do you mean it's too violent?_\"); Terry Farrell (who played Jadzia Dax) asking to be written out of the show with only one season left because she felt she was being mistreated behind the scenes; the entire cast (except Colm Meaney) not being especially happy with the arrival of _TNG_'s Michael Dorn in the fourth season; the lesbian kiss in the fourth season episode \"Rejoined\" that ignited huge controversy; the psychological toll that playing Benny Russell in the sixth season masterpiece that is \"Far Beyond the Stars\" took on Avery Brooks (who also directed the episode, brilliantly, I might add).\r\n\r\nThe film also spends a lot of time looking at some of the series' more politically-charged moments. _Star Trek_ in general has always done political themes very well, but whereas _TOS_ and _TNG_ tended to operate via allegory and metaphor, _DS9_ was more direct, shining an unflinching light on all kinds of issues. Terrorism, for example, was built into the show's DNA in the character of Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), a former member of the Bajoran Resistance who had waged a guerrilla war against the Cardassian forces during the Occupation of Bajor. This conflict was actually introduced in the fifth season _TNG_ episode \"Ensign Ro\", and the character in _DS9_ was originally intended to be the titular Ro Laren (Michelle Forbes). Ultimately, however, _DS9_ went much further than _TNG_, depicting Kira as suffering from PTSD and crippling survivor guilt. It's especially interesting to hear Behr and Visitor talk about how the character of Kira (a freedom fighter to the Bajorans, a terrorist to the Cardassians) almost certainly wouldn't work in a post-9/11 world. The film also reminds us how PTSD was also addressed when the character of Nog (Aron Eisenberg) lost a leg in battle during the seventh season episode \"The Siege of AR-558\", with the next couple of episodes looking at the psychological implications of his injury. The film presents several military vets attesting how much it spoke to them to see _DS9_ handling such weighty themes with dignity and grace.\r\n\r\nAnother important theme was racism, which was addressed many times, but never more explicitly or more successfully than in \"Far Beyond the Stars\", which is set in 1953, and depicts a writer, Benny Russell (played by Brooks), whose science fiction short stories are pulled from publication when word gets out that he's black, leading to what is hands down the most emotionally devastating and powerfully acted moment in the franchise's history. In relation to LGBTQ+ issues, the film points to the aforementioned kiss in \"Rejoined\" and also the long-rumoured but never confirmed theory that recurring character Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson) was in fact gay. Indeed, in relation to inclusivity, Behr laments that the show could have done better, arguing that one kiss and one rumour over seven years wasn't enough and that he should have done more, especially in terms of having the courage to reveal Garak's sexuality. It's a remarkable admission and the kind of raw honesty that's rare for a documentary made by the very people whom it is about.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the film addresses how _DS9_ was the only show on TV which depicted science and religion as co-existing. With most shows treating them as binary opposites, _DS9_ was unique in being a science fiction show where several of the main characters were deeply religious; indeed, Sisko is even a religious icon to the Bajorans, something with which he is initially uncomfortable, but which he later embraces, with religion becoming more and more important in the show's mythology. An issue that illustrates just how little acknowledgement the show has gotten is the importance of black characters. _DS9_ was not the first TV show with a black lead, that was the _Spencer for Hire_ spin-off _A Man Called Hawk_ (which starred none other than Avery Brooks), but it _was_ the first show to regularly feature scenes with _only_ black characters. When discussing this aspect of the show, Behr is unable to contain his frustration when he relates how an episode of _That's So 90s_ pointed to _Homicide: Life on the Streets_ (1993-1999) as being the first show to feature scenes of all black characters, never even mentioning _DS9_. This kind of thing is something the show's cast and crew (and fans) have gotten used to over the years, but it's still somewhat upsetting to see just under the radar the show was despite the pioneering work it was doing.\r\n\r\nAnd with that said, if the film has an overriding theme, it's vindication; the sense that the choices the showrunners made at the time, choices which were criticised and often not understood, have stood the test of time, with the show rightfully thought of today as unusually mature and progressive. Behr mentions, for example, how the writers always treated plot as secondary to character, something which was opposed from on-high, but they never wavered, writing stories whose primary function was to facilitate character development (contrast that with something like _Sons of Anarchy_, an entertaining show, but one which buried its characters under a never-ending avalanche of plot). Another example of this vindication concerns the three-part second season opener; \"The Homecoming\", \"The Circle\", and \"The Siege\". The first three-episode arc in _Star Trek_ history, the idea was met with considerable resistance, with Paramount execs arguing that a three-parter would never work. However, as the show would go on to prove time and again (ultimately doing an unprecedented ten-episode arc in the last season), being on a space station rather than a ship lent itself to multi-episode storylines.\r\n\r\nAnd one final point. The reveal of the \"greatest moment in the history of _DS9_\", which comes during the closing credits, is one of the most epic examples of Rickrolling you'll ever see (albeit with a _DS9_ twist).\r\n\r\nAre there some problems with the film? Yes, a couple. Most notably, Avery Brooks does not appear (there is some interview footage, but it's archival). This leaves a massive lacuna in the film, not just in a practical sense, but in an emotional one as well; he was the heart of the show (and the only actor to appear in all 176 episodes), so for him not to feature is massively disappointing. However, in the years after the show went off the air, Brooks has gradually retired from film and TV acting (his last credit was _15 Minutes_ in 2001) whilst also appearing at fewer and fewer _Star Trek_ events. A tenured Professor of Theatre at Rutgers University, he hasn't done anything _DS9_ related since his truly batshit insane appearance in William Shatner's _The Captains_ in 2011, and obviously, Behr was unable to persuade him to appear. Another problem is that with Behr conducting the interviews, there's a sense in which he lets both Berman and McCluggage off too easily, especially in relation to the Terry Farrell situation, whereas a stronger interviewer wouldn't have accepted their deflecting and ambiguous responses. Another small problem is that Behr occasionally \"stops\" the film entirely to intercut scripted moments, usually involving himself. As the director and primary subject, this technique crosses the line into self-indulgence, and yes, the scenes are supposed to be humorous, but they're nowhere near as funny as the off-the-cuff moments elsewhere, and they are both structurally awkward and thematically unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThat aside, however, _What We Left Behind_ is an exceptional documentary. _DS9_'s reputation as the \"dark _Star Trek_\" is not unearned, but as the film reminds us, it was often bleak but never cynical, often pessimistic but never nihilistic. On the contrary, what the film does especially well is remind us just how humanistic the show really was, perhaps the most humanistic iteration of the entire franchise, and that any bleakness or darkness was earned by the contrasting moments of levity and humanity, by the depth of the characters and their relationships with one another. Looking at its myriad of strong women, its commentary on the psychological cost of war, its engagement with racial tensions, its marrying of science and religion, the film is about what the makers of the show left behind, but so too is it about how the show changed the future of television. The interviews with the cast and crew really drive home just how much it changed their lives, whilst the clips of fans talking about why they love it so much illustrate the extent to which it touched people. And given that _Deep Space Nine_ was so long maligned, considered the \"middle child\" of the _Star Trek_ family, it's ironic that, in essence, _What We Left Behind_ is about the love which the show has engendered."

We're just like the soldiers down there: pawns to their leaders... BLINDED BY LOYALTY!!! \". \r\n\r\n______________________________________________________ \r\n\r\n**A \" HIGH POINTS \" :** 1- Just to \"Keep Things Fresh\", I'm going to shake it up a bit, & start with the Musical side of things, this time around. Ergo : \" So -{ Completely }- Enchanting, Engrossing, & just downright 'On-Point  was the -entire- soundtrack for \"Eternals\" ; with its -Utterly- captivating blend of Soft Rock, Celestial Choirists, 'Heavenly-Ethereal', Soprano Soloists & even a plain good old-fashioned 'silky smooth guitar-synth-vocal ensemble' from Pink Floyd . . . . . that I simply couldn't help but have the -Nagging- feeling that this goliath movie's veteran Music Director, ( Ramin Djawadi ), took an 'Inspirational' page out of Tom Holkenborg's sheerly -Fantastic- 'Musical Playbook' for 'GVK' ( 2021 ), & just ran with it, in the 'best way possible' \". 2- Visually, the picture is nothing short of -{ MESMERIZING 🌌 }- , comfortably living up to the \"Super\"-high standards set by -{ ALL }- of the past 25 MCU ( Marvel Cinematic Universe ) Creations, starting with the \"Fabulous\" And Indeed, -Groundbreaking- 'Ironman', all those years ago in '08 ( with Ramin -Also- doing the whole score for -that- particular Marvel film, incidentally ! ). The Art Direction, Fight Choreography, Stuntwork, Post-Production Digital Effects -and- the Live 'On-Set' - Physical- Special Effects are -all- 'Par Excellence', & well and -{ Truly }- leave little to be desired.\r\n\r\n3- Eternals's cinematography, entirely -Unsurprisingly- , is for the most part 'Lavish, Pristine, & often just outright Gorgeous' ; as is only be -expected- , I suppose, of a movie shot by the likes of -Veteran- lensman Ben Davis . . . . who clearly worked 'Hand-In-Glove' with its \"Frightfully\" Talented Directress, the one & only Chloé Zhao 🔥. At a 'diminutive' 5 feet 4 inches, the ever 'decorous', some might even say 'demure' \"Miz\" Zhao is fast becoming a veritable 'come-from-behind' \" CINEMATIC POWDER KEG\", in the world of all things Hollywood. When Marvel undertook its -{ \"Massive }- gamble by hiring the -Relatively- unknown ( at -that- point ) filmmaker to direct Eternals in Sept.'18 . . . . little did they know that she would not only go on to direct what was to later become the \"Best Picture\" Oscar Winner 2021 ( \"Nomadland\" - 2020 - Indie ) ; but that she would -Also- take home \"Best Director\" ; with the picture having been nominated in -YET ANOTHER FOUR- categories ; and having gone on to -Win- one more Oscar Award -Still- 👏❗ So in a nutshell, if you saw Nomadland and thoroughly appreciated its wide, expansive, & breathtakingly lovely shots, then Eternals -Is- likely to be immensely gratifying to you in -that- respect, without a question . . . with the latter -Not Only- 'generously' providing many, many -{ S P R A W L I N G L Y }- Beautiful Vistas for the eyes to 'feast' on . . . but -Also- giving you a few Mind Numbingly Stellar SPACE shots, as well. \r\n\r\n**B \" DRAW BACKS \" :** 1- I suppose I would be -Well- advised to say, at this point, 'Right-off-the-bat' , that Eternals is well and truly a -Genuinely- difficult film to fully, well . . . . -{ \" U N P A C K \" }- . . . . what with its myriad \"Revisions\" of not only Earth's natural history, but of that of the -Entire- Cosmos 🤷‍♂️❗, as well ; not to mention some -OUTRIGHT- \"Dichotomies\", -{ And }- a truly 'Massive' -Gaping- Hole in the story, towards the end of said movie. The 'gaff' in question is quite -literally- ...{ \"COLOSSAL\" }... as it pertains to a pointedly \"Spatial\" aspect relating to the Celestial 'Tiamut'-s \"Emergence\" ...( hinted at in multiple -Official- previews for the Eternals )... and occurs within the picture's grand finale. I won't reveal any more details about said mistake, because I'm trying very hard to keep this a -NON- spoiler review, ( and what's more, I am confident that if you pay close enough attention to said finale, you are -Very- unlikely, to miss it ). 2- Also, the 'Deviants', ( a.k.a alien ' Apex Predators 👾 ', one of whom is prominently seen fighting Angelina Jolie's 'Thena' on a beach in the aforementioned trailers ), appear a bit too \"Wire Fram-ey\" ....for lack of a better phrase.... for at least the -Entire- first half of the film. In other words: the WIRE-FRAME look that they embody hurts that whole proverbial 'Suspension-Of-Disbelief' thing . . . . to a small, albeit -{ Significant }- . . . . degree. Other than that, as I'm -Immensely- pleased to report, the film boasts nothing less than a -{ \"Stunning\" }- level of CGI prowess, all the way through. \r\n\r\n**C \" FINAL SUMMARY \" :** This is EASILY Marvel s -{ Most }- \"Thought-Provoking\" movie, Although 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame', ( with all of their -Own- varied and multitudinous complexities ), are not necessarily -All- that far behind. The fact is, this veritable cinematic collosus boasts not only -Several- Intensely { HUMAN } moments . . . . but also a level of -Philosophical- , ( and I'm going to be -Very- honest here ), 'straightup', you guessed it, -{ EXISTENTIALIST }- mind fodder, as well . . . which most certainly makes it 'the exception and -Not- the rule', in the world of modern day, massive-scale, 'Contemporary Popular Entertainment'. What's more, the absolute- totality of the -Principal- actresses and actors, bar -NONE- .....( it's a sheer 'Who's Who' ensemble cast of about 13, hence too many to mention here )..... do an undeniably -Wonderful- job bringing these 'super-Exotic' characters to life ( almost ) -directly- out of the late great Jack Kirby's ( Rest In Love ! ) comic-book pages. If I just -Had- to pick the performance that stood out for me though, it would unquestionably be Miz. Chan's ( 'Sersi'-s ) truly august & dignified, um, \" Gemma 💎 👏❗Of A Performance\" ( sorry peeps, -Just- couldn't resist that one ! ) . . . on account of the Deeply Beautiful \"HUMANITY-AND-EMPATHY\" that she so effortlessly appears to bring to her -Leader's- role, in Eternals. **Thus, it's going to be : A \" Solid, Whole Hearted . . . . And Indeed, -{ \"Super\" }- Appreciative 8.75 Marks Out Of 10 Marks \", From Yours Truly.**"

Let’s face it: unless we are very intelligent or very beautiful, if a Marvel film actually came to life around us, our roles would be as helpless victims either saved or killed as collateral damage. So we are talking vicarious involvement here. The only Marvel film I would keep watching any time it comes on is Ant Man and the Wasp, as I find its wit and humor irresistible.\r\n\r\nAs I watched Eternals, I absorbed what I felt were a couple of plot holes large enough for an eternal to fly through. And I am not talking about the science; I give a lot of leeway to scence fiction and similar genres in order to serve the plot. I mean, they went to the trouble of explaining why the Eternals weren’t around to help out with our boy Thanos, but considering the origin story of the Eternals, I did wonder why there didn’t all have every superpower rather than one each.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I will not do a deep dive into how this entry serves the overarching Marvel story arc, because I am not a Marvel fan, per se. (After all, I was a DC comic reader as a young lad!) Suffice to say Eternals did not insult my intelligence as a movie viewer but rather, as mentioned at the outset, it held me all the way through it."

The plot revolves around the fact that a certain deity sends detachments of superheroes endowed with superpowers to protect intelligent life on different planets from evil predatory creatures remotely resembling ancient lizards, which they almost successfully cope with, but it turns out that the main characters fought absolutely the wrong evil and the main battle they are ahead. The first hour of the film is mostly banal chatter and shots telling about previous events, but towards the end there is an increase in the intensity of events up to an epic massacre of good and evil. The plot does not carry a global mystery and everything is clear from the very beginning, and small plot twists are guessed even before the viewer sees them. And judging by the finale, the audience will be fed one more, and maybe several films on the topic."

        "content": "The premiss here is quite fun - 7,000 years ago a diverse race of immortals arrive on Earth to protect the population from a monstrous race of \"Deviants\" who are bent on eating us all up. Their \"Prime Directive\", if you will, is that they must not interfere in human conflict, so once they have cleared away the beasties, they split up and lead separate lives. That is, until \"Sersi\" (Gemma Chan), her pal \"Sprite\" (Lia McHugh) and her beau \"Dane\" (Kit Harrington) are set upon in London by a newly empowered creature only to be rescued by \"Ikaris\" (Richard Madden) - and that incident forces them all to reassemble. Pretty soon they discover the body of their erstwhile leader \"Ajak\" (Selma Hayek) and must now combine their forces to thwart their ever strengthening enemy and learn why they have resurfaced. Unfortunately, what now follows is a stunning looking, but really pretty dull series of set-piece scenarios that rather clunkily combine mythology and melodrama, romance and action. The camera loves Madden, but as an actor - even clad in blue leather - he is little better than a handsome man. Kumail Nanjiani (\"KIngo\") has a soupçon of charisma, but the rest of the cast including the really out of place Angelina Jolie (\"Thena\") and Harish Patel (\"Karun\") who is intent on videoing everthing at considerable risk to himself, really offer little by way of characterisation and the attempts at humour misfire most of the time. The story has some great effects, but so what? That's what we expect from the most mediocre of productions nowadays. What was needed here were far fewer actors and a much more robust story - and, yes, it could probably have lost the half an hour spent justifying the enormous budget in far-lung locations (real and imaginary). There's a final scene midway through the credits that really does not bode well for the sequel either. I was really pretty bored with this film and though undoubtedly a colourful, action-packed big screen experience, it is an entirely forgettable film to watch."

        "content": "Although it was nice to watch a Marvel movie which is not just a rehash of the same old universe and which was reasonably woke-free for once this movie was unfortunately pretty meh. It is not as bad as many of the detractors claim but it is miles away from being as good as some of those who liked it claims. It is actually pretty meh.\r\n\r\nOn the good side there are some decent special effects but that is more or less to be expected. It is the one thing that Marvel movies usually have going for them after all.\r\n\r\nIt is a fairly serious movie that is not so polluted with comic relief as some of the Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nThe story is a interesting one but it is unfortunately a bit wasted by the implementation in this movie. Also, it pretty much screws up evolution from the extinction of the dinosaurs as well as any form of religious theories (not that I am a great believer in those though). But then this is pure superhero fantasy so I’m not too bothered by that.\r\n\r\nMy main gripe with this movie is that it, as is way to often the case with Hollywood, portrays the Eternals more like a bunch of bickering dysfunctional children than the wise thousands of years old beings that they are supposed to be.\r\n\r\nIkarus in particular is a pure Hollywood asshat. He reminds me of that pervert asshole Homelander in the depraved Hollywood creation The Boys. However Druig and Sprite also grated on me in a lot of the scenes. I never like characters that betray people, stick knifes in peoples backs (literally) and so on.\r\n\r\nThe movie also felt a bit slow. There was a lot of rather boring filler material between the actual action or advancement of the story, and a shitload of flashbacks. I hate flashbacks but then that is probably personal. To me they just interrupt the flow.\r\n\r\nThe movie also does not really feel very positive. It ends rather sadly actually. Also, at the end they may have saved Earth but, if the story is to believed, by doing so they prevented billions and billions of beings from ever being created. Not really a win-win is it?\r\n\r\nIt is clear that this movie was setting things up for a continuation and, despite my reservations about this one, I think there is a pretty good oportunity to create something decent from this. It all depends on whether they pick a decent write/director or one of the woke Marvel hacks."

Now, if the Eternals predate the Avengers by a few millennia, and have been actively and openly involved in various periods of human history, where where they during the events of the last two Avengers movies?\r\n\r\nSince those (mis)adventures had nothing to do with “Deviants”, the Eternals presumably couldn't be bothered to lift a finger. If that’s the case, why did they stay on Earth so long after the Deviants had supposedly been eradicated?\r\n\r\nAnd if the Deviants are at least as old as the Eternals, why are they called after a word in a language that wasn't going to exist until eons later? This question actually has an answer, albeit a nonsensical one: as far as I can discern English is, for some unfathomable reason, the lingua franca of the Universe, which of course includes both the Earth and Olympia.\r\n\r\nOne Eternal even communicates with sign language, which I guess means she invented it. Moreover, several Eternals have an unambiguous ethnicity; are we to understand that they originated these, for lack of a better term, races on our planet?\r\n\r\nOr is it just a big coincidence that Olympia has Mexicans, Irish, Scottish, Pakistanis, and South Koreans? And speaking of inventions, it seems that ancient civilizations were more (or less, as the case may be) technologically advanced than we had previously thought; specifically when it comes to the CGI that they apparently used to build their cities.\r\n\r\nThis imagery that looks straight out of Age of Empires is the reason that Eternals never generates the slightest sense of urgency (and if it did, it could never keep it up for the more than two and a half hours of running time).\r\n\r\nWho cares about the destruction of the world when the world in the first place is plainly phonier than a diploma issued by Megatrend University? Hell, the entire Universe seems to consist almost exclusively of green screens.\r\n\r\nHow much respect or fear can Arishem and the Deviants respectively inspire or instill when they are nothing more than shapeless masses of pixels? All things considered, the only redeeming thing about this film is that it points out (unwittingly, I must assume) the arbitrariness of everything that has to do with the MCU: \"Five years ago, Thanos wiped out half the population of the universe ... But the people of this planet brought them all back with a snap of the fingers.\" Now imagine a 7,000-year long finger-snap."

It follows teenager Murdo as he travels from Scotland to Alabama following the death of his mother. Murdo plays the accordion, but the tragic disruption in his life has caused him to set it aside for a while. It starts out as a sort of road movie, then, before settling down a bit.\r\n\r\nDuring a lull in the trip by bus to Alabama, Murdo hears accordion music being played. He seeks it out and finds Queen Monzee-ay, a regionally well-known cajun singer performing. He gets to know her and she invites him to perform with her in an upcoming event. Her attention and his experience with her people awakens Murdo's interest in his music. This causes a slight rift between him and his father, who out of good intentions is perhaps a bit controlling of his son.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed this movie. The story is strong and told simply. No flashbacks or dream sequences - what we get is a drama about grief and family, strong characters in an ensemble cast, and a lot of music. It doesn't hurt that I really enjoy Cajun music.\r\n\r\nIf I could suggest anything, I would like to have seen a bit more conversation between father and son. There is a lot of silent staring and halting tidbits which do convey their sense of loss. But as someone who lost my father and a brother at a young age, and whose family didn't talk a lot about it either, I felt I could almost have written some strong scenes of dialogue to show more character growth. But that is a minor observation. I would recommend the film to anyone, as long as they also enjoy or at least tolerate the music."

        "content": "While audiences are thankfully seeing more female-driven horror films in the movie world, black female horror is even more of an anomaly. That’s why writer / director Justin Simien‘s “Bad Hair” is so damn interesting. The story of one woman’s ambition and her (literal) killer weave is an absurd yet astute satire of popular culture with a meaningful message. This is one you’ll be talking about long after the final credits roll.\r\n\r\nSet in Los Angeles circa 1989, Anna (Elle Lorraine) prefers the au naturel look after a traumatic childhood hair accident left her with a burned scalp. She’s a hardworking assistant on a music video show for the Culture television network, but struggles to get a promotion due to the way she looks. When Anna’s supportive boss is fired and a former supermodel (Vanessa Williams) is brought in as a replacement, Anna is scared of being let go and decides to do something about her appearance. She gets a gorgeous new weave and learns her flowing locks may just be the key to success that she was missing — until her hair gets a taste for blood.\r\n\r\nThe hair-raising (snort!) story is cleverly based on fictitious slave myths and superstitions that weave in (pun intended) the idea of mystical African folklore in relation to what the horror of everyday life feels like (including the pain some endure in pursuit of beauty) for black women in America.\r\n\r\n“Bad Hair” is a nontraditional horror film that’s presented in a traditional way. There are jump scares and a silly finale, but Simien blends humor with horror in this campy thriller.\r\n\r\nIt’s also a pensive style of social horror that will likely be more meaningful to women as well as people of color. The film tackles the absurdity in everyday life and in particular, the system of oppression that preys on African-American women the most. The women in the film are tricked into becoming their own oppressors, all in the name of fitting in with what society defines as beautiful.\r\n\r\nThis movie is super smart, brutally honest, sometimes scathing, and highly uncomfortable, but it’s also really funny."

        "content": "This movie is actual special. While it is billed as a kung-fu wiseguy mashup, it is really a story of coming to terms with who we are, and also a love story. The lead character 'Vinny' Chow, is a Chinese guy in NY who wants to date an Italian girl. Why not, right? But she only dates wiseguys, so he figures to get her attention he will become one, too. Thing is, he can't, and this causes all the fun trouble in the film. Also, in the middle of all the macho men is a a gay black guy, Lawrence, who is the only one in the film who is secure in who he is. He speaks with a high-pitch voice, flirts, does theater and is the most bad ass fighter of them all. He is successful because he is comfortable being himself. Vinny is not, and so his life is a mess. Then the two funny homeless sages turn out to be all in Vinny's head. They are his conscience, the angel and devil on his shoulders, helping him figure himself out. And with so many Easter eggs references to classic mob and kungfu movies, I'll tell you, one second and third viewing this film really shines. It is a delight that is much deeper than first-glance chuckles."

Images and props from other films. The writer did a great job smashing stereotypes by directing fun at them, not playin on them. He actors played their parts straight, with silly dialogue. I think this is the first time these two genres have been mixed, and at the core is a story of self-identity and love. Really good. Not a 10, but sure to be a Cult Classic and a study for film students for decades to come."

The first trailer made me more excited, because seeing those god-awful effects only made me want to see it more. I always get excited for big-budget musicals because it means we could get more, but ‘Cats’ just fails on every level. It’s a boring musical with forgettable songs and uninteresting choreography... and then it also fails as a bad film, since it offers no batshit fun. Poking fun at the CGI is all well and good, but you can do that from the trailer, so there's no point being bored for two hours during this holiday season.\r\n\r\nMeow, that hurt indeed.\r\n- Chris dos Santos\r\n\r\nRead Chris' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-cats-no-bad-kitty-no-one-is-the-jellicle-cat"

To question it is to deceive yourself.\r\n\r\nPersonally I've never believed that Cats is a great musical but perhaps its success says something else but even so a film adaptation in my view just could not work. I didn't see how, especially considering the costumes but it was being made so the question now was how it was going to look.\r\n\r\nI know there's already a ''movie'' but that's basically a recording of the play.\r\n\r\nThen the trailers appeared and what they showed looked weird, off putting and scary, but the visual work is not always everything in a movie, yet something decisive was being played here.\r\nEventually the defeat was inevitable.\r\n\r\nCats is full of good intentions but it's a failure, not only because of terrible work in CGI and how it makes you feel but because it never manages to immerse you in the world of the story and is a bizarre world and I can have fun in bizarre worlds, it's only that this one is pretty misguided.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's that huge fiasco that a lot of film critics are saying it is and maybe eventually will find its niche and audience, after all worse films have become cults films, so that can surely happen but right now Cats is simply an idea that didn't work, that it wasn't well executed or directed and that although it's not a monumental catastrophe, it's indeed a gigantic disappointment."

It turns out that these are just two of a plethora of heroes from the \"Justice League\" who try to keep the evil \"Lex Luthor\" from achieving world domination. What nobody expects here though, is that a meteor that \"Luthor\" had hoped would give him the power to finally defeat his nemesis ends up in the hands of a loved-up guinea pig (\"Lulu\") - and a clever and scheming guinea pig at that. She rather adeptly uses her new-found powers to embolden an army of other, now ninja, guinea pigs to capture and imprison the \"Justice League\" so she can get prove her worth to the love of her life - the ruthless \"Luthor\". There is a glimmer of hope! The meteorite that enhanced the rodents has also fallen the way of a few others, and together with \"Krypto\" they band together, learn to harness their powers and the scene is set for a final showdown. The animation is perfectly adequate, but the story is weak and far too thinly strung out. The turtle has a few quite witty lines of dialogue but the rest of it mixes cheese and sentiment in an almost cringe-making fashion. There are far too many characters and by the end it has a sort of chaotic \"Avengers Endgame\" (2019) scenario that was as devoid of jeopardy as it was dull and repetitive to watch. At times, indeed, it was almost as if DC wanted to make a film to remind us that not all super-heroes were developed by Marvel.

And with great cinematography.\r\n\r\nIt is 1975. Claudio (Darío Grandinetti) is the Doctor, a prestigious lawyer from a town in an unnamed province of Argentina, married to Susana (Andrea Frigerio) and with a teenage daughter. A tense incident with a stranger (Diego Cremonesi) in a town restaurant will be the first in a series of events that will call into question the Doctor's calm.\r\n\r\nActually, the first scene of the film is another, a powerful fixed shot over a house, in a scene of enormous eloquence. For those who do not know, or do not remember, in 1975 Isabel Perón ruled and Argentina was already devastated by the kidnappings and murders of the Triple A (Alianza Anticomunista Argentina), a parapolice organization linked to the Government, in a true advance of what that it would be state terrorism established by the civil-military dictatorship that overthrew Isabel in 1976.\r\n\r\nRed is a remarkable and disturbing film. Its plot suffers an apparent drift by situations that seem disconnected but that in reality are integrated into a powerful and implacable X-ray of an era: violence (sometimes left out of the field), disappearances, dispossession, looting of the victims, the swindle, the silence, the imposture, the impunity. But all under a layer of apparent normality and within the framework of a province intervened to \"restore\" it.\r\n\r\nNaishtat's film could be defined as a sociological and political black cop. Each scene is a necessary note (and never underlined) on the general picture, including the successful scene on a beach in Mar del Plata.\r\n\r\nFrom the formal point of view, the filmic recreation of the time is remarkable, with that tone between faded and sepia that dominates photography and its red titles. There is a great use of still shots and beautiful wide shots in desert locations.\r\n\r\nGrandinetti's very good performance, while the apparent over-acting of a character who later appears in charge of Alfredo Castro (the actor from I'm afraid of a bullfighter), also has its justification.\r\n\r\nThe school device could not be absent in this story, when a teacher (Susana Pampín) rehearses with Claudio's daughter and other classmates the dance Los Salvajes from the opera Las Indias Galantes by Rameau (a luxury of the soundtrack) for an act school and what he says to put them in position for the scene, in what constitutes a disturbing stagin"

This figure includes adults and children. The number of homeless families has increased by 83% since January 2016. More than one in three people in emergency accommodation is a child. However, this number does not include 'hidden homelessness' which refers to people who are living in squats or 'sofa surfing' with friends. Furthermore, women and children staying in domestic violence refuges are not included in these homeless emergency accommodation counts. The_ _national figure also does not include people who are sleeping rough._\r\n\r\n> _In November 2018, the official rough sleeping count confirmed 156 people sleeping rough in Dublin, with an additional number in the Night Café, without a place to sleep._\r\n\r\n>[...]\r\n\r\n>_In the past, most people using emergency accommodation were single adults. But in the last three years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of families becoming homeless, and in January 2019, there were 1,614 families accessing emergency accommodation. This includes 3,624 children._\r\n\r\n>[...]\r\n\r\n> _According to Focus Ireland research and analysis, the overwhelming number of families becoming homeless had their last stable home in the private rented sector, and the crisis in this sector is the immediate cause of their homelessness - landlords selling up or being repossessed, shortage of properties to rent, scarcity of properties accepting rent supplement, and high rents._\r\n\r\n> _Most of the families becoming homeless have never experienced homelessness before and never thought this could happen to them. Thousands more families are struggling on very low incomes or social welfare and many are falling into serious housing difficulties as rents continue to rise._\r\n\r\n>[...]\r\n\r\n> _At the end of January 2019, there were over 893 young people (adults aged under 25) living in emergency homeless accommodation. This represents an 84% increase from January 2015. 65% of these young people live in Dublin._\r\n\r\n>[...]\r\n\r\n> _What you see above is the 'official' homeless figures. It is widely recognised that large numbers of young people live without a permanent home but do not enter homeless services. These young people survive by sleeping on a friend's sofa, squatting or staying in other insecure or unsafe places._\r\n\r\n> _We know so little about the real numbers of young people facing homelessness in this way and the challenges they face that Focus Ireland has referred to them as 'the forgotten homeless'._\r\n\r\n>[...]\r\n\r\n> _The right to housing is recognised by the United Nations (Article 25 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) and the UN has been active in highlighting homelessness as a violation of human rights._\r\n\r\n- \"About Homelessness\"; Focus Ireland\r\n\r\nTackling the current homeless crisis in Ireland, specifically in the capital city of Dublin, _Rosie_ is as relevant and timely a film as you're ever likely to see. Directed by Paddy Breathnach (_I Went Down_; _Shrooms_; _Viva_), and written by Roddy Doyle (_The Commitments_; _The Snapper_; _Family_) in his first feature since _When Brendan Met Trudy_ (2000), the film is an intimate character drama rather than an angry piece of protest cinema. Not concerned with pointing fingers at who may be responsible for this situation, examining why it is getting worse rather than better, engaging with the economic complexities, or analysing the wider socio-political implications, Doyle is instead more interested in imparting to the audience that homelessness could happen to almost anyone. Rather than evoke ire, he wants to evoke empathy, something that is, sadly, often lacking in our inured social media-obsessed society. One need only look at some of the comments on previews of the film to see what many people really think about the homeless – in short they're all lazy scumbags looking for a handout; one particular comment was, \"why would I want to see a film about wasters on the dole trying to con themselves into a gaff?\" For whatever reason, Irish society in general, and Dublin in particular, has become one of great bitterness, void of empathy for those struggling on the margins, and this film tries to go some way to addressing that. Unfortunately, the lack of major stars, the almost non-existent advertising campaign, and the grim subject matter will hamper its commercial prospects, and whilst I'd love to say this is going to be the Irish equivalent of Ken Loach's _Cathy Come Home_ (1966), enacting change on a grand scale, the chances are it will pass from cinema screens without much of an impact. Maybe if there was a superhero in it, more people would go to see it. Whatever the case though, irrespective of its commercial achievements, or lack thereof, _Rosie_ is an exceptionally well made film.\r\n\r\nAs with much social realist cinema, _Rosie_'s plot is simplicity itself. Set on Dublin's Northside over the course of roughly 36 hours (from 16.30 on a Wednesday afternoon through to the early hours of Friday morning), the film tells the story of the Davis family; mother Rosie (Sarah Greene), father John Paul (Moe Dunford), and four young children - thirteen-year-old Kayleigh (Ellie O'Halloran), eight-year-old Millie (Ruby Dunne), six-year-old Alfie (Darragh Mackenzie), and four-year-old Madison (Molly McCann). Several days previously, the family were forced to leave their rented private home of seven years when the landlord decided to sell the property, giving them only two weeks' notice. With most of their possessions at John Paul's brother (Lochlann O'Mearáin) and his wife's (Natalia Kostrzewa), the couple have packed the essentials (spare clothes, toiletries, a toy rabbit named Peachy, who is practically another character, etc.) into their car, out of which they are now effectively living. As John Paul works every hour he can washing dishes in an up-market organic restaurant, Rosie spends the day looking after the kids and trying to arrange temporary alternative accommodation by calling the numbers provided to her by Housing Welfare; hotel rooms where the family can stay, with the bill paid by Dublin Corporation via the oft-mentioned \"_Dublin City Council credit card_.\" However it soon becomes apparent that finding somewhere in the stretched-to-bursting system is not going to be an easy task; she starts the film asking for somewhere for \"_a couple of weeks_\", before dropping to \"_three or four nights_\", and finally pleading for a single night's accommodation. Meanwhile, she has to get the three older children to their various schools, and later pick them up, all the while trying to keep Madison entertained. Attempting to organise such things as washing the clothes, bathroom visits, and the completion of homework all from the confines of the car, Rosie quickly learns that without a roof over your head, even the simplest of tasks becomes a complex logistical nightmare. With all this going on, she has no time to look for a new house, so John Paul attends an open property-viewing on his lunch break, a trip which ends with a foreboding and infuriating realisation. In this situation, the last thing the family needs is more trouble, but when Rosie goes to pick Kayleigh up from school, the sullen teenager is nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nDoyle began writing _Rosie_ two years ago after listening to an interview with a woman who explained that although her husband worked full-time, the family were living out of their car, finding themselves with literally nowhere to go after being evicted from their rented accommodation. The woman emphasised that she never imagined such a situation for herself or her family, explaining that ordinary people don't realise how easily this can happen to them. And this is precisely the theme Doyle emphasises in the film. The Davis family are a completely normal working-class family, meeting none of the commonly held (mis)conceptions about the homeless, and the film challenges at every turn the stereotypical images we have of such people. As Greene tells RTÉ,\r\n\r\n> _audience[s] are often very quick to place judgement on people in these situations – that they might be cheating the system, or taking benefits, and this is not the case. It's that the system is failing thousands of families._\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Davis family are an \"ordinary family\" enables Doyle to demonstrate that no great economic cataclysm or personal defect is necessary for people to be cast into the void, it's as much to do with bad luck and bad timing, and, in this sense, the film explores the extent to which the housing crisis has begun to cross class borders.\r\n\r\nSince Doyle began writing, the crisis has worsened significantly, making the film even more relevant now than it was two years ago. Indeed, a scene in the film in which the family are told to spend the night in a Garda station is as \"ripped from the headlines\" as is humanly possible. When asked about the film's topicality by RTÉ, Greene states,\r\n\r\n> _I think that's why Roddy wrote it, because he was so angry at the situation, and felt ashamed, being a citizen of Ireland, at this happening. We're not a Third World country, we're a very wealthy country, and it is shameful to see so many families in this situation. It's not okay._\r\n\r\nDunford adds,\r\n\r\n> _this story is about normal people who are just in a desperate situation, and it could happen to anybody. It's the last thing that they considered ever happening to them._\r\n\r\nAs this may suggest, Rosie is a piece of social realist drama in the tradition of Ken Loach or Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne. However, it is much less concerned with constructing a left-wing world-view than the French brothers (I'm thinking of something like _L'enfant_ or _Deux jours, une nuit_), and far less melodramatic than recent Loach output (the most obvious point of comparison is the predictable and manipulative _I, Daniel Blake_ (2016), a decidedly inferior film to _Rosie_). As with all social realist cinema, Rosie speaks to the privations of the working class, and voices a critique of prevailing social structures. However, the nature and target of that critique is less conspicuous than we often find in the work of Loach, Mike Leigh, or Antonia Bird, with the film placing more emphasis on private character beats than synecdochical situations or character archetypes.\r\n\r\nOne of the strengths of Doyle's script is that he has been able to transmute emotionless news headlines and dry statistics concerning the rising tide of homelessness into a deeply effective and emotional story which does, by all means, work as a call-to-action, but which is much more forcefully a call-to-care. Doyle is not overly interested in sermonising about the failings of the State, concerning himself much more with what the housing crisis means to real people in practical terms. Avoiding overarching socio-political protest, he focuses on eliciting empathy and compassion for a situation about which the majority of people simply don't care. Sure, when a homeless person dies on our streets, there is much head shaking and \"isn't it terrible\" remarks, a few fingers pointed at our officials, but the majority of people do nothing – they don't give to charity, they don't volunteer, they don't give people a few euro on the street, or buy them a coffee and a roll, they don't campaign, they don't care. _Rosie_ dares you to care. It demands that you care.\r\n\r\nIn exploring this issue, Doyle's script is remarkable for its sense of restraint, avoiding condescension, cliché, predictability, and melodrama. Rather than the characters speechifying about their plight and the state of the country, they devote all their energies to simply getting through the day, dealing with each on-the-spot challenge (such as going to the toilet) as it arises. As a result, they never come across as a manipulated political device, existing only at the level of symbolism or allegory, merely a means to allow the screenwriter some socio-economic grandstanding (indeed, the wider-ranging homeless crisis itself is literally never mentioned in the film). However, this is not to say that the film avoids looking at how this kind of situation can exist in a country whose GNP has dropped only twice in the 21st century, and has risen steadily since 2009, and markedly since 2014. The film very much deals with the issues arising from the housing crisis, but in subtle ways.\r\n\r\nFor example, during a small disagreement between Rosie and John Paul, she criticises his job, saying the restaurant where he works make \"_organic lunchboxes_\". Her derision at the incongruity that her family is on the street, whilst others enjoy this kind of luxury is never explicitly stated, but it is there in Greene's performance, which offers a novel take on the old \"_the gap between the haves and the have-nots is widening_\" speech. Another example is found when John Paul attends an open-viewing for a house he and Rosie are thinking of buying in the East Wall area of Dublin. Finding the house crawling with people obviously considerably more wealthy than himself, John Paul asks the real estate agent to put his name down, only to be told the house \"isn't really suitable for a family.\" Again, the real meaning behind this remark is left unsaid, but the critique of gentrification is unmistakable. An extremely important scene in this respect is when Rosie visits her brother-in-law and his wife. When he refers to the family being homeless, she quickly chastises him, telling him \"_don't use that word_\", and denying that the family are, in fact, homeless. This speaks volumes as to cultural stigma and social labelling. The family are very clearly homeless, but Rosie is unwilling to use the word or acknowledge that status, as to do so would place her amongst a social class that has been utterly cast off, and is generally seen as less than dirt by the populace at large.\r\n\r\nAside from the way in which it handles the housing situation as a national crisis, Doyle's script is surprising in other respects. For example, something I didn't see coming is that Rosie's mother (Pom Boyd) has a decent-sized house, and a good relationship with her grandchildren, who she is more than happy to let stay with her. However, she and Rosie have had a falling out recently over something unspoken concerning Rosie's deceased father, and her mother won't let Rosie back into the house until she takes back whatever she said. Rosie, for her part, refuses to apologise, and as she also refuses to split the family up, that means the children can't stay with their grandmother. In this respect, one of the sub-themes of the film becomes one of personal ethics – will Rosie abandon her principals in order to put a roof over her children's heads? Another nice piece of writing is that Doyle doesn't have Rosie and John Paul at each other's throats the whole film, as we might expect. Instead, they support each other 100%, working together to try to keep the children's spirits up, and only seriously arguing once (which, tellingly, they do away from the kids). One of the film's most salient themes is that theirs is a marriage of genuine love and respect, and that goes double for their family. The film may be asking for empathy from the audience, but it also depicts a great deal of empathy, as Breathnach and Doyle stress that this is a tight-knit family unit filled with love and affection. Their situation may be grim but they are in it together. Doyle has also fashioned an absolutely knockout ending, which somehow manages to be both extremely uplifting, yet utterly soul-shattering.\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, Breathnach's direction is utilitarian, wisely avoiding any kind of directorial gymnastics which would draw attention away from the story. Which is not, however, to say that the film is visually uninteresting. One particularly well-blocked scene sees Rosie talking to a school principal, with the sequence shot in such a way that the two-shot is demarcated by a computer monitor, literally cutting Rosie off from the well-to-do world represented by the principal. The scenes in the family's car (which comprise a sizable portion of the film) are suitably cramped and claustrophobic, with a palpable sense of unrest growing ever more prominent as the film continues. In contrast, however, many of the exterior scenes are shot in such a way as to feel disconcertingly empty, with Rosie and her family often dwarfed within the frame, creating a real sense of hopelessness and swimming-against-the-tide. Additionally, almost the entire film is shot with handheld cameras, with a lot of the exteriors consisting of long single-take Steadicam shots which create a sense of urgency, as well as depriving the characters of any sense of the control with which they could be imbued by editing. Much of this works to enhance the film's prevailing aesthetic style, which is a kind of pseudo-_cinéma vérité_ documentarian approach, with the on-screen _milieu_ feeling completely authentic.\r\n\r\nOne especially well managed aspect of the film is how it deals with the task of ringing around the various hotels trying to find a room, going through the exact same conversation over and over and over again. Before we see any images, we hear a radio report talking about the homeless crisis, followed by Rosie ringing the first number on her list. Then the image fades in. This conversation becomes a refrain, and is continued throughout the film, serving almost like a chorus punctuating the rest of the days' activities. It's also worth noting that Rosie's mobile phone is visible in practically every scene.\r\n\r\nI'd be remiss here if I didn't address the performances. Greene is simply outstanding as Rosie, carrying the bulk of the film, and most of the emotional weight (a good 70-80% has her front and centre). Her attempts to remain calm in front of the kids, never losing her temper or chastising them for being frustrated with their situation, and her sorrow and regret on the few occasions when she does, are utterly heart-breaking. Her brave face slips a couple of times, and when it does, there is no sense of catharsis, no feeling of pressure being released. There is just sadness, and acknowledgement of her suffering. Despite her outward optimism, the ominousness of the situation is always there, right beneath the surface. It's an extraordinarily subtle and layered performance of just a few emotional registers, but it's completely effective and rings completely true. The ever-reliable Dunford is also excellent in the slightly under-written role of John Paul, imbuing the character with a warmth and fragility, especially noticeable in a heart-breaking scene in which he reveals to Rosie his shame at not being able to adequately provide for or protect his family.\r\n\r\nAlthough _Rosie_ is about a national crisis, it is also intensely personal. Doyle may not be outwardly concerned with the politics, but his sense of anger is unmistakable as he attempts to show that the ordinary and decent people of this country are being humiliated and degraded on a daily basis. Speaking to RTÉ, Dunford states,\r\n\r\n> _this is about our people, this is about Ireland, this is about a bigger picture. It's about our brothers, it's about our sisters, it's about how they're being taken for fools by weasely people in government who are cowards, and something has to be done. That's what it's about._\r\n\r\nIn this sense, Rosie should make audiences angry. And it probably will. The problem is that it will have a very small audience. This is not _Cathy Come Home_ being watched by 12 million people on the BBC. This is a small independent film playing on a few screens across the country, a film of which the vast majority of the cinema-going public have never heard. In the end, despite the fact that it's exceptionally well made, deeply affecting, and flawlessly acted, _Rosie_ won't make much of a difference or have much of an impact. And that's a crying shame."

        "content": "Guava Island musically enraptures its tropical aesthetic through severe self-indulgence. Donald Glover’s rhythmically-inclined alter-ego, Childish Gambino, is an inspirational talent. A rare find that cements the credibility of the current generation’s ability to produce harmonious tunes with a political trajectory. His “Awaken, My Love!” studio album infused psychedelic funk with soul and hip-hop, while his latest singles “This Is America” and “Summertime Magic” provide insight into his meticulous thought process. He is an artist through and through. So it comes to much astonishment that Guava Island, a miniature film that was clearly targeted at fans of his discography, was unable to find its footing amidst the soothing tropical breeze. A local musician/celebrity attempts to hold a music festival for the oppressed town of Guava Island, albeit ignoring the threatened warnings from the local dictatorial business magnate.\r\n\r\nIt commenced with an animated folk tale, narrated by the stunningly beautiful Rihanna (“Te Amo”!), describing the origins and current state of Guava Island. Considering the runtime, totalling just under an hour, this method of expressionistic exposition was required to construct the foundations of the basic narrative. Delightful, if somewhat mundane. Murai, in his directorial debut, then proceeds to the live-action bulk with a stylised 4:3 ratio filter equipped with grainy visuals for authenticity. Considering the economic and structural climate of Guava Island, it was immersive and enhanced the world Rihanna lovingly described to us.\r\n\r\nGlover goes about his day, carrying his wooden guitar, singing and reinterpreting his latest singles. The infamously abnormal dance moves proceeded with “This Is America” in the middle of a factory. Then it hit me. Guava Island is essentially a “musical” to coincide and/or boost the promotional material of Gambino’s songs. Disagree? Well, he then proceeds to serenade Rihanna with “Summertime Magic” before winning my heart over with “Feels Like Summer”.\r\n\r\nA fundamental question then dawned on me. Can the artistic integrity of music be translated effectively to a narrative feature? Perhaps, but Guava Island is not a good example of that. The musical spirit of the island’s residents being suppressed by a totalitarian state is nothing new and, unfortunately, conveyed obviously. The relationship between capitalism and the affected individuals of its grotesque aftermath failed to empower. This is due to Glover’s self-indulgence blurring the clarity of the story. Rihanna’s Kofi and her relationship with Deni is almost non-existent, despite the ‘Romeo & Juliet’ introduction. These characters are so focussed on portraying eccentricity, that the dynamics between them fell flat. Glover’s frequent collaborator and older brother was unable to balance all aspects in such a condensed time constraint within his screenplay. It’s so “to the point” that it loses that flavoursome flair that makes Gambino the artist he is.\r\n\r\nThat’s not to say the music isn’t catchy and Uzowuru’s rhythmic score won’t make you sway, as the musical aspect will have the biggest effect. The acting is serviceable, even if Glover can’t escape his exaggerated TV tendencies, and Sprenger’s cinematography is sublime. Unfortunately though, Murai’s inability to balance the film and rein in Glover’s overpowering talent taints Guava Island to be a drinkable albeit sour beverage."

After watching the movie, I felt that my entire soul was polluted and poisoned, and I was almost afraid that my clothes were all full of radiation. It was a shocking thing for me.\r\n\r\nWe have seen what humans do in certain things they make and don't think about their consequences even if they know their consequences. There are companies that do not care about any of the creatures on the planet, only seeking and crawling for money.\r\n\r\nThere have been films similar to Dark Waters such as A Civil Action 1998 by John Travolta and Erin Brockovich 2000 by Julia Roberts.\r\n\r\nThis movie, which contains destruction, pollution, and damage, harms a frightening number of living creatures. The movie portrayed major companies as a scary monster that devours humanity and living creatures, even seaweed.\r\n\r\nI loved Mark Ruffalo in this movie. He played the role of a person who makes huge sacrifices in order to reveal the truth. He waited 15 years for the American judiciary to issue the final ruling in the case, and we saw how big and giant companies rule the country regardless of the law. Mark Ruffalo's acting was strong and I liked it, but it doesn't reach the perfection that deserves an Oscar.\r\n\r\n\r\nBill Camp impressed me the most in this movie. He could be an Oscar star. His scenes were powerful and breathtaking, and the pain was heart-wrenching.\r\n\r\nThe sequence of the story and events was somewhat flopped at the beginning of the movie, sometimes it becomes interesting and sometimes it becomes boring. I understand that the story is long and its events took place over a period of years. I think it is worth making a series for this instead of a movie, in order to see a more coherent story.\r\n\r\nI don't think that Dark Waters deserves an Oscar, but it deserves to be nominated for an Oscar, and it is a good drama movie, and I wish it would be done in the form of a series"

They understood how to hide the budget in the lighting and they understood how to bring faces out of a dark environment.

In the woods many miles north of Atlanta, a nubile female is forced to leave her homestead and hooks up with a Confederate cavalry in the area.\r\n\r\nBased by the book “Perfect Disguise” by Lydia Hawke, “The Confederate” (2018) is a Civil War movie, but of the low-budget Indie variety similar to \"War Flowers\" (2012), \"The Last Confederate: The Story of Robert Adams\" (2005) and \"Dog Jack\" (2010). As such, the production values are rudimentary with wooden acting and the service of Civil War reenactors. This is the least of the four with “War Flowers” and “The Last Confederate” being the best.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem is that it’s impossible to buy the protagonist (Heather Clark) as a male. The big-budget Western \"The Ballad of Little Jo\" (1993) had the same problem. \"Just One of the Guys\" (1985) was able to succeed with this challenge because Joyce Hyser looked stunning as a female, but also convincingly passed for a dude when made-up appropriately. So, to appreciate this flick, you have to imagine the protagonist looking more male than depicted. \r\n\r\nIt's vital that a movie like this have human interest (otherwise it's a lost cause) and it scores pretty well in this area if you can roll with the very basic production values. I was able to acclimate to its limitations and enter into the world of the characters and enjoy it. \r\n\r\nThe folk songs by Jennifer Gatch are a highlight, particularly the outstanding “I Am a Rebel Soldier (and Far From My Home).” \r\n\r\nIf you like quality low-budget Civil War flicks, like \"Pharaoh's Army\" (1995) and \"The Colt\" (2005), and don't mind micro-budget Indies with the corresponding flaws, give it a try.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 45 minutes, and was shot in the Augusta, Georgia, region, which includes nearby South Carolina.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-"

We cannot eat nutritious food. We don't have a good life, we live in pain for the rest of our life and die in pain. Low wages is the main reason. How much burden can a woman take? Husband, children, house and factory work – can we manage all these with such a meagre salary? So we are caught up in the debt trap. Is there no solution for our problem? The targets are too high. They want 150 pieces an hour. When we can't meet the targ__ets, the abuse starts. There is too much pressure; it is like torture. We can't take breaks or drink water or go to the toilet.

They jumped to their deaths in front of the very people who purchased the clothing they made. The outrage of seeing these people die lead to consumer and political activism to ensure this did not happen again. Better fire safety, building safety, and workplace safety standards came out of this activism. And during the twentieth century Americans fought and demanded for change. We got the minimum wage, the eight-hour day, workers' compensation, Social Security, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and a whole lot more._\r\n\r\n>_By the 1960s and 1970s, the corporate response eventually became to move production overseas, first to Mexico, then to east Asia, and today all across Asia and Central America. They did so not only for cheap wages, but to avoid workplace safety regulations and environmental regulations. So in 2013, when over 1,100 workers die at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, it is the same industry as the Triangle Fire, with the same subcontracted system of production that allows apparel companies to avoid responsibility for work as the Triangle Fire, and with the same workforce of young and poor women, the same type of cruel bosses, and the same terrible workplace safety standards as the Triangle Fire. The difference is that most of us can't even find Bangladesh on a map, not to mention know enough about it to express the type of outrage our ancestors did after Triangle._\r\n\r\n>_This separation of production from consumption is an intentional move by corporations precisely to avoid being held responsible by consumers for their actions.

Someone on the national minimum wage would have to work 69,000 years to get paid £1 billion, and a newly qualified nurse would have to wait 50,000 years. No one needs or deserves to have that much money, it is obscene._\r\n\r\n- John McDonnell (Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer), speech on November 18, 2019\r\n\r\nWe live in an era where wealth is distributed upwards and the gap between the haves and have-nots has become wider than ever. According to inequality.org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth, whilst adults with less than $10,000 capital make up 64% of the population and control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the _milieu_ of _Greed_, a hilarious satire from incredibly prolific genre-hopping writer/director Michael Winterbottom (_Family_ (TV); _Welcome to Sarajevo_; _24 Hour Party People_; _Code 46_; _A Cock & Bull Story_; _A Mighty Heart_; _The Killer Inside Me_; _The Trip_ (TV); _The Emperor's New Clothes_). Examining how the rich get richer whilst the poor get unpaid jobs building faux-Roman coliseums on Greek islands, the film focuses specifically on a successful British clothing entrepreneur, and its bread and butter is the concomitant grotesquery that results when an individual has the same wealth as a small country. Effectively mixing send-up and satire with more serious socio-economic points, _Greed_ doesn't really do or say a huge amount that hasn't been done or said before, but it's entertaining, amusing, and undeniably relevant.\r\n\r\nSir Richard McCreadie (Winterbottom's regular leading-man Steve Coogan in full-Steve Coogan mode) is one of Britain's richest men, and in possession of Britain's whitest teeth. The perma-tanned \"self-made\" billionaire is the owner of several thriving clothing chains and is known as \"the King of the High Street\", although a less complimentary nickname is \"Greedy\" McCreadie. The non-linear narrative depicts three main events in McCreadie's life. We see his rise to power, when, as a young man (played by a wonderfully loathsome Jamie Blackley), he opens multiple businesses (all of which fail) as he learns the ins and outs of asset-stripping, the importance of using foreign sweatshops, and how to exploit realty and tax practices without breaking the law. In the modern-day, we see him hauled before a Parliamentary Select Committee convened to investigate the bankruptcy of one of his chains. And, in the film's present, on the Greek island of Mykonos, the final (chaotic) touches are being put to McCreadie's Roman-themed 60th birthday bash – complete with mandatory togas, a fake coliseum, and a real, albeit somnolent, lion (McCreadie is obsessed with Ridley Scott's _Gladiator_ – and yes, the fact that there were tigers rather than lions in that movie is brought up several times). The party is scheduled to take place in a couple of days, or at least it will if the underpaid Bulgarian workers will ever finish the coliseum, the optically-unappealing Syrian refugees will ever leave the nearby public beach, and the litany of celebrities who promised to swing by will ever stop cancelling.\r\n\r\nMuch of the story is told through the lens of McCreadie's \"official biographer\" Nick (David Mitchell in full-David Mitchell mode), a classically-trained literature buff who drops quotes from Shakespeare and Shelley into everyday conversation, and who hates himself for agreeing to write a fawning celebration of McCreadie – a task which sees him shadow the man himself on Mykonos, having previously visited McCreadie's Sri Lankan sweatshop to talk to the workers about how much they love their job and 'appreciate' McCreadie for employing them. We also meet Margaret (Shirley Henderson in heavy makeup), McCreadie's acerbic Irish mother, who's been with him every step of the way; Samantha (Isla Fisher), McCreadie's ex-wife, who's come to Mykonos with her spectacularly French boyfriend, François (Christophe de Choisy), although it's obvious she and McCreadie still have feelings for one another; Naomi (Shanina Shaik), McCreadie's current wife; Finn (Asa Butterfield), McCreadie and Samantha's obviously damaged son, who has a penchant for bringing up Oedipus's patricidal tendencies to anybody within earshot; Lily (Sophie Cookson), McCreadie and Samantha's daughter, who's filming a (staged) reality TV show with her obviously gay 'boyfriend' Fabian (Ollie Locke); Melanie (Sarah Solemani), the under-pressure party-planner; Frank (Asim Chaudhry), the world's most laid-back lion handler; Amanda (an extremely impressive Dinita Gohil), McCreadie's overworked PA, who comes to occupy the spotlight in a very unexpected manner; a cadre of (hilariously bad) lookalikes for all the guests who've cancelled, in an effort to fool the press (the Rod Stewart and George Michael jokes are especially worth looking out for); and a host of (real) celebratory cameos, including Stephen Fry, James Blunt (a viciously self-effacing appearance that's one of the funniest moments in the film), Pixie Lott, Ben Stiller, Colin Firth, Fatboy Slim, Ed Sheeran, and Caroline Flack (to whom the film is dedicated).\r\n\r\nThe idea that a billionaire could be so cut off from workaday reality as to stage a Roman-themed birthday party on a Greek island may sound far too on the nose, too ridiculously hubristic to say anything of any worth, and too over-the-top to even function as satire. However, it's worth noting that McCreadie is based on Sir Philip Green, chairman of the Arcadia Group (which owns, amongst others, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Topman, Topshop, and Wallis), avoider of taxes, exploiter of the working-class, asset-stripper, and enemy of the #MeToo movement. Similarly, many of the details of McCreadie's ludicrous birthday are lifted verbatim from Green's very real 50th birthday celebrations in 2002 – when he flew 219 guests to Cyprus for a three-day toga party which featured live performances from Tom Jones and Rod Stewart (and, while we're on subject, the party for his 60th was even more lavish).\r\n\r\nMcCreadie, of course, is a hilariously despicable slimeball, a man who unironically feels hard done by when Syrian refugees show up on the (public) beach he's using for his birthday, and both Coogan and Blackley portray him as not only narcissistic and void of conscience, but as a completely classless philistine – whereas Nick, for example, can quote Shakespeare and recite Shelley, lofty symbols of Englishness both, McCreadie proudly gets his cultural know-how from BrainyQuote (unless he's quoting _Gladiator_, which he appears to know word-for-word). However, the important point is that for all his loathsomeness, McCreadie is a symbol for the system that gave rise to and sustains him. He and those like him didn't arise in a vacuum; he's simply the result of an economy that takes from the poor and gives to the rich. For all his crass hubristic excess, McCreadie is neither an aberrant individual nor is he a criminal – he's an especially vulgar product of the system. And, with the crushing defeat of Labour in the 2019 English general election, it seems he's the product of a system which the vast majority of people appear to support.\r\n\r\nThe film gets pretty serious towards the end, and before the closing credits, a series of title cards detail some of the facts and figures of global economic disparity, particularly concerning the vast gulf between those who make the clothes we wear and those who sell them to us. Originally, these cards named specific brands as especially guilty of exploiting sweatshop employees, pointing out, for example, that workers in Myanmar earn $3.60 a day making clothes for H&M, whilst owner Stefan Persson is worth $18 billion, and workers in Bangladesh earn $2.84 a day making clothes for Zara, whilst owner Amancio Ortega is worth $68 billion. However, Sony Pictures International, which financed the film with Film4, refused to allow Winterbottom to use these cards, with company head Laine Kline telling him, \"_we're worried about the potential damage to Sony's corporate relations with these brands_\". And so replacement cards were used, which feature much of the same information but without reference to any specific companies or people. So how do we know what the original cards said? Because Winterbottom, very much in the viciously sardonic spirit of the film, read them out on-stage after the world première in Toronto! Kline, who was in the audience, was far from impressed, which may account for the shoddy advertising campaign, with the film being released into theatres with virtually no market awareness. Whatever the case, Kline seems unaware of the irony of his actions – in relation to a film which accuses the rich of all manner of shenanigans to insulate and protect themselves and their fortunes, a massive corporate entity has exerted its authority to protect other massive corporate entities. It's like something McCreadie himself would do.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the film employs a plethora of techniques, including non-linear editing, direct-to-camera addresses, YouTube videos to provide exposition, split-screen, fake news footage, and title cards. It's all very Guy Ritchie, busy and flashy, presumably to mirror McCreadie's own excess. However, the film is at its most effective when at its simplest, particularly in scenes involving the wonderful Gohil. Amanda's interactions with Nick provide the emotional core of the story, and there's nothing bombastic or ostentatious about their construction – it's all simple shot/counter-shot editing and blocking. And by far the film's best sequence, which comes towards the end, is another simple setup involving Amanda, McCreadie, and a third character who I won't name, as it would be a spoiler. With a terrifically emotive piece of music by Harry Escott (_Shame_; _The Selfish Giant_; _Journeyman_), this scene tells its story not through aesthetic construction or even through dialogue, but through the expression on Gohil's face. It's the moment during which Winterbottom drops all pretence of comedy and focuses on the more serious issues that have hovered at the fringes since the opening seconds.\r\n\r\nI've seen it said by some critics who disliked Greed that taking pot-shots at the super-rich is easy, which is undoubtedly true. But does that somehow imply we should stop doing so, that they're not a valid target for satire? Just because criticising such ilk is \"easy\", that doesn't mean such criticisms are invalid. That's like saying, \"_Nazis were evil and all, but they're an awfully easy target for criticism_\". Yes, they are. As they should be. Personally, my biggest problem with the film would be two underdeveloped subplots. The reality TV show subplot provides for some very funny individual moments, but it contributes nothing whatsoever to the main plot. Additionally, the fact that McCreadie and Samantha are still in love with one another never really goes anywhere, which is a shame, as it could have provided some much-needed character development for her and some shades of grey for him.\r\n\r\nSociety does not need billionaires. Capitalism would be just fine without billionaires. But, for better or worse, we live in an age where there are more billionaires than ever before and the gap between their wealth and the wealth of the poorest members of society is only growing wider. Equal parts funny and disturbing, _Greed_ is a comedy about the excess and disconnect of such people, but so too is it a cautionary tale, a reminder that just because we're removed from exploitation doesn't mean such exploitation isn't happening."

The film tries to tackle too many hot topics, including the selfishness and sins of the mega-rich, the excesses of the fashion industry, the exploitation of mistreated factory workers, and the plight of impoverished refugees. Its themes may be crowded, but the film is never boring.\r\n\r\nThe movie tells the fictional story of luxury fashion retail honcho Sir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan), an idiot narcissist billionaire who is an excellent villain for modern times. Sir Richard is planning a spectacular themed 60th birthday party on the Greek island of Mykonos, and price is no object when it comes to having proper silverware, a “who’s who” guest list of the hottest celebrities, the finest gourmet cuisines, and a hand-built replica of the Roman Colosseum, complete with a gladiator match featuring a live lion.\r\n\r\nThere’s a moral outrage that intensifies as this slightly satirical story turns darkly tragic, and the dialogue is crisp and witty as screenwriter (and director) Michael Winterbottom aims his pen squarely at the target of Western capitalism. But despite an extremely satisfying ending and the film’s heart being in the right place, “Greed” isn’t as hard-hitting as it could (or should) be. It feels far too real for that."

        "content": "It is probably best just to assess this satirical comedy on a superficial level; otherwise the hypocrisy is overwhelming. Steve Coogan plays a self made gaziliionaire who is organising a no expense spared celebrity 60th birthday party for himself on Mykonos. In cahoots with his ex-wife Isla Fisher and his mother Shirley Henderson we are exposed to the most vulgar and crass aspects of the mega-rich lifestyle in which they live whilst at the same time exploiting just about everyone that they come into contact with - regardless of gender, education or ethnicity. Jamie Blackley \"Young Richard\" takes what plaudits there are in this. He is expelled from his posh private school school for regularly fleecing the other pupils; next he is fleecing those in the London rag trade before setting up a discount store that sets the ball rolling for his future billion pound enterprise. Coogan is good as the odious and exploitative \"McCreadie\"; David Mitchell really wooden as his autobiographer \"Nick\" and we have a few scenes for Asa Butterfield as his slightly geeky son \"Finn\" but the rest of this has mis-information and double standards written all over it. The comedy is obvious; the constant parodies from \"Gladiator\" (quite why the lines spoken in that film by Richard Harris were being delivered by Coogan is an Australian accent was a bit puzzling) grate after a while and the ending just downright ridiculous. If it is attempting some sort of social commentary on how the wealthy get rich on the backs of others then it needed to be much better informed and make some attempt to reconcile the aspirations of rich and poor alike - as well as those of the ever-thrifty, something for nothing consumers living in countries of the \"west\" and their mind-numbingly incompetent legislators."

        "content": "At times, you can't help but feel like Mike Cuenca's full-length feature _I'll Be Around_ is as aimless as the characters themselves, though this isn't nearly the insult you might be thinking it is and it actually tends to lend the film a natural spark that makes even the most sluggish, mundane moments quite entertaining throughout the film's just over two hour running time. \r\n\r\nThe film is set against the backdrop of a post-punk music festival and centers around a literal slew of eccentric thirtysomethings struggling with life, society, work, their art, and the seemingly impossible task of weaving all of these things together. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a film with a cohesive plot, look elsewhere. _I'll Be Around_ goes around and around a myriad of different story arcs, some matter and some really don't particularly matter. In essence, that may very well be what the film is ultimately about. \r\n\r\n_I'll Be Around_ features special appearances by several familiar faces, a nice touch of authenticity, including J Mascis (Dinosaur Jr.), Frank Agnew (The Adolescents), Casey Royer (D.I.), punk icon Pleasant Gehman, and Mystery Science Theater 3000's Jonah Ray. The action takes place over the course of a day, before and during the festival, and the film's music definitely kicks some serious ass. \r\n\r\nWhile the special appearance are cool, _I'll Be Around_ ultimately gets its groove from its actual eccentric characters that populate the film from beginning to end. Among the special appearances, Jonah Ray shines brightest as a hilariously twisted hypnotist whom you're definitely going to remember. It's Sarah Lawrence who truly stands out, her Eve Valentine a successful rock vet who's seemingly lost her identity and vacillates between bickering with her manager and fans and showing us glimpses of the rock star with whom everyone likely fell in love. Lawrence does a beautiful job of capturing Eve's broad spectrum and offers a performance here that demands Hollywood take a bigger look at the actress. \r\n\r\nBrendan Takash's Kip is also incredibly memorable. He's another one you fall in love with from his opening scene, an introverted weirdness that is both compelling and definitely punkish. You'll identify with him more than a little and yet Takash creates an incredibly unique character who defies the stereotypes often found in this type of role. \r\n\r\nDrew Clapp shines as Cooper, somehow transcending a storyline that isn't particularly engaging and selling us on Cooper anyway. Emma Koffroth gives a charismatic turn as Babs, while Kat Yeary's turn as Joanie takes that old \"I'm a musician but I gotta pay the bills\" storyline and adds some substance to it. Grant Moninger and Jesse Gavin have a good time as a couple of thieves with their own artistic bent. There are others, quite a few others, as _I'll Be Around_'s interweaving storylines involve right around 50 characters whose presence varies greatly amidst the film. \r\n\r\nThe third feature film from Cuenca, _I'll Be Around_ is a crowdfunded effort that had just kicked off its festival run when COVID-19 stormed its way into the U.S. and disrupted fests nationwide and around the world. The film picked up the prize for Best Independent Film at the Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival and seems destined to pick up a few more awards along its indie/micro fest journey once COVID-19 gets kicked to the curb. \r\n\r\nCo-written by Cuenca with Dan Rojay, _I'll Be Around_ possesses a strong naturalism throughout and Cuenca and Rojay have a strong ear for dialogue even if the overall film tries a little bit too hard to accomplish a little bit too much and occasionally falls a wee bit short. \r\n\r\nFor the most part, these modest lapses are excused because the film's so incredibly engaging and the characters are just a joy to travel with even in their relatively irrelevant moments. In fact, with such a large cast it seems weird to not mention a few more. So, what the heck, let's give some major kudos to Sofia Grace as Phoebe and Joey Halter's surprisingly meaningful turn as Rex Dollar$, a smooth talker with a bit of an ejaculation issue. \r\n\r\nJessica Gallant's lensing is strong throughout and while the music itself is a little more secondary than you might expect, it gives the film practically a perfect vibe and energy. \r\n\r\nFor more information on _I'll Be Around_, be sure to visit the film's website and watch for it at an indie fest for you. Solid music features are rather hard to come by and _I'll Be Around_ is a definite winner. \r\n\r\nWritten by Richard Propes\r\n**The Independent Critic  **"

The current global pandemic closed movie theaters worldwide, but fortunately, some countries already opened them, including my own. My IMAX screening of Tenet was my first trip to a theater since February! As a firm believer and strong advocate of the so-called \"cinematic experience\", I would always remember fondly the day I returned to a place I hold very close to my heart independently of my opinion about the film. Nevertheless, it became an even more special day once I left that enormous screen behind with a happy face.\r\n\r\nNowadays, people complain about everything, especially on social media. So, I'm not surprised that the \"savior of cinema\" marketing tagline triggered so many souls. If Nolan didn't have enough haters, it surely got a few more after this campaign. Me? I look at it like any other marketing scheme: it's intended to hype its own movie, so I don't really understand why this specific publicity caused so much controversy. Obviously, \"savior of cinema\" doesn't mean Nolan is going to save theaters from dying. It's just a tagline trying to hype the first major blockbuster in several months! It's a marketing strategy to try and convince people to give Tenet a go. If there's a film meant to be seen at the biggest screen possible, this is the one.\r\n\r\nI'll get the outstanding technical achievements out of the way. Inception and Interstellar boast impressive visuals that are hard to compete with, but Tenet is up to the challenge. With uniquely complex, stunning, grand set pieces, Nolan delivers riveting action based on a mind-blowing temporal concept that will make every single viewer scratch their heads. I lost count to the number of times I tried to open my eyes more so I could see (and understand) everything that was going on. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is handheld for a lot of action sequences, and he has such control over his craft that he was able to capture some of the most jaw-dropping action moments of the last few years through gorgeous angles and a firm grip.\r\n\r\nNolan said that Tenet would be \"the hardest movie to cut\" for any editor. Jennifer Lame's editing plays a vital role in the time inversion sequences. It's relatively easy to imagine how brutal of a task she must have had. She's incredibly consistent throughout the runtime with perfectly timed cuts that elevate even the simplest of scenes. I wish I could be more specific, but in order to avoid spoilers, I'll just write this: she has a bunch of nominations coming her way, including an Academy Award. Ludwig Göransson's score is tremendously powerful, and it definitely adds to the magnificent action set pieces, especially in the third act.\r\n\r\nFinally, Nathan Crowley (production designer) creates such a realistic look that it almost made me believe this could actually occur in the real world. CGI has come a long way, and it's indisputably a tool that can completely transform films into something fascinating when used correctly. However, practical effects will always offer a feeling impossible to replicate through computerized images. It's probably the aspect I appreciate the most about this movie: its massive application of practical effects and real stunts. It surrounds the physics-defying premise within a bubble of realism, and that's only achieved with talented people in the right technical departments.\r\n\r\nStory-wise... this is where it gets tricky. I have to be honest about my experience: I found it surprisingly okay to follow and not that challenging to understand. This doesn't mean that it isn't a remarkably complex, layered narrative with ideas that will be incredibly hard for some people to comprehend. I'm not trying to patronize anyone, far from that, but some viewers will inevitably leave the theater without completely understanding what they just saw, simply because it's a two-hour-and-a-half movie packed with heavy exposition about a fictional quantum physics concept. For example, in the same way that some people genuinely can't have a 3D perspective, other people will also have visual difficulties in distinguishing the inverted sequences.\r\n\r\nThe need to be vague about plot details doesn't let me explain a lot, but the unique concept Nolan develops in Tenet is undoubtedly an exceptionally intriguing idea. As crazy as it might sound, I found the visuals more confusing than the actual scientific explanations that they go with. Unfortunately, that's one of my main issues with the film. Throughout the entire runtime, there's an excessive load of exposition about the time shenanigans. It's a massive amount of information for anyone to be able to remember every single detail. Even worse, some dialogue sequences feel so incredibly forced that it's almost like the movie stops for quick breaks where the characters explain something directly to the audience.\r\n\r\nThis last point leads me to another problem. John David Washington gets better and better as time goes by, but he feels like a mediator between the film and the audience for the first half of the movie. His dialogue revolves around asking questions about what's happening and how the time inversion works, which is obviously understandable given the character's circumstances, but the execution of these conversations lacks that spontaneous vibe. It really feels like someone yelled \"Action!\", the actors did their lines, and that same someone yelled \"Cut!\". Washington isn't exactly a worldwide, well-known actor (Ballers, BlackKklansman), and this is his first big blockbuster appearance, so his inexperience didn't help him through these moments.\r\n\r\nHowever, he ends up being a fine protagonist (no pun intended). Robert Pattinson is charming and quite funny, actually. I couldn't avoid the \"humorless\" review headlines, and being totally honest, it's surprisingly a lot funnier than I thought it would (not) be. His character has a vital role in the whole story, and it's through him that most of the knowledge about the intricate concept at hand is developed. Elizabeth Debicki is probably the spotlight stealer, though. With a remarkable performance, she represents the emotional arc of the film, and she delivers one of her best interpretations ever. I was afraid that her storyline would turn into a forced romance, but fortunately, it only helped build Washington's character traits.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Kenneth Branagh plays a cliche Russian bad guy with generic motivations who feels way too formulaic for such a ground-breaking movie. But ultimately, that's what Nolan presents. His astonishingly talented methods as a director and his obsession with detail as a writer make Tenet a certainly flawed yet phenomenal film with a concept that might be the hardest he's ever had to pull off. As long as people can remove themselves from the real world and enter a whole new one with entirely different mechanisms and rules, it will be the so-called \"blockbuster of the summer\" that everyone deserves this year.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Tenet undoubtedly boasts an incredibly complex narrative with a unique temporal concept impressively demonstrated through spectacular, loud, jaw-dropping, practical action set pieces. Christopher Nolan is a masterful director and a fascinating writer, but he has to thank its technical crew for creating such a visually stunning blockbuster. From Hoyte van Hoytema's riveting camera work to Jennifer Lame's seamless editing, passing through Ludwig Göransson's powerful score and Nathan Crowley's beautiful production design, Tenet is one of the most technically mind-blowing movies of the last few years. With the help of a remarkable cast (especially Debicki and Pattinson), the definitely intriguing story makes the epic runtime feel a bit shorter, despite some scenes being unnecessary. The heavy and forced exposition throughout the entire film transforms an otherwise entertaining flick into a fictional physics class that will confuse thousands of viewers. It also doesn't help to have a generic MacGuffin and a formulaic villain at the core of such an unconventional movie. In the end, Nolan isn't the \"savior of cinema\" (no one will be), but he certainly delivers the blockbuster everyone's been waiting for since the beginning of the year. As long as people are able to accept and enter his new world, Tenet will be received as one of the best films of 2020.\r\n\r\nRating: A-"

        "content": "There is a moment midway through this film where you can suddenly feel everything clicking into place. Up until this point, the film has been entertaining, with some great set pieces and a scope that is trademark Nolan, but the central hook of the film - “time inversion” - has felt almost superfluous to the plot, albeit a clever visual conceit that gives the film a different vibe to your average spy thriller. But then comes the “moment” - a simple act of crossing a threshold - where suddenly you realise how the visual conceit is going to figure into the rest of the film and also how most of the first hour has been pure setup for what is to follow. It’s the kind of twist that isn’t really a twist at all as it is a visual explanation that the film has really been waiting for. Nolan has taken quite a gamble in delaying this “moment” for so long and there is always the feeling the film is hiding elements of the plot in the first half. This means the explanation may have come too late for some to invest in the film fully, but if you are still with it, there is a sudden feeling of exhilaration of knowing to an extent some of what is about to follow and the film lets loose with some fantastic set pieces that are hugely satisfying if you have been paying attention.\r\n\r\nPerformances are great, with Branagh in full scenery chewing mode and the score is suitably Zimmeresque and loud. It doesn’t quite hit the highs of its closest cousin - Inception - but it’s scope is similarly impressive and it’s going to lead to plenty of theories and explanations in order to follow each major character’s journey through the film. Great stuff in the end, but it was touch and go there for a while."

More precisely, the laws of science are unchanged under the combination of operations (or symmetries) known as C, P, and T (C means changing particles for antiparticles. P means taking the mirror image, so left and right are interchanged. And T means reversing the direction of motion of all particles: in effect, running the motion backward). The laws of science that govern the behaviour of matter under all normal situations are unchanged under the combination of the two operations C and P on their own. In other words, life would be just the same for the inhabitants of another planet who were both mirror images of us and who were made of antimatter, rather than matter._\r\n\r\n>_If the laws of science are unchanged by the combination of operations C and P, and also by the combination C, P, and T, they must also be unchanged under the operation T alone. Yet there is a big difference between the forward and backward directions of real time in ordinary life. Imagine a cup of water falling off a table and breaking into pieces on the floor. If you take a film of this, you can easily tell whether it is being run forward or backward. If you run it backward you will see the pieces suddenly gather themselves together off the floor and jump back to form a whole cup on the table. You can tell that the film is being run backward because this kind of behaviour is never observed in ordinary life._\r\n\r\n>_The explanation that is usually given as to why we don't see broken cups gathering themselves together off the floor and jumping back onto the table is that it is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics. This says that in any closed system, disorder, or entropy, always increases with time. In other words, it is a form of Murphy's law: things always tend to go wrong! An intact cup on the table is a state of high order, but a broken cup on the floor is a disordered state. One can go readily from the cup on the table in the past to the broken cup on the floor in the future, but not the other way round._\r\n\r\n- Stephen Hawking; _A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes_ (1988)\r\n\r\n> _Imagine you and a friend decide to go to Pisa, with one of you standing atop the famous leaning tower and the other located down at the bottom. From the top, whoever throws a ball off the edge can easily predict where it will land down on the bottom.

Time reversal can be thought of the same way as motion reversal: if the rules are the same whether you run the clock forwards or backwards, there's true T-symmetry. But if the rules are different when the clock runs backwards from when the clock runs forwards, the T-symmetry must be broken._\r\n\r\n- Ethan Siegel; \"No, The Laws Of Physics Are Not The Same Forwards And Backwards In Time\"; _Forbes_ (July 5, 2019)\r\n\r\nWatching _Tenet_, the latest film from writer/producer/director Christopher Nolan (_Memento_; _Inception_; _Interstellar_), I was reminded of an apocryphal story about NASA – during the space race, in an attempt to tackle the problem of how to write in zero gravity, NASA poured millions into developing the Fisher Space Pen, whereas the Russians simply gave their cosmonauts pencils. And it seems to me watching this overblown mess of a film that Nolan has become so fixated on the grandiosity of the pen that he has completely overlooked the humble pencil. More so than any of his previous work, _Tenet_ is focused on mixing philosophy and real(ish) science with over-the-top mainstream entertainment to such an extent that he ignores such basic narrative principles as character arcs, empathy, motivation, and interiority. Now, don't get me wrong, I love filmic experimentation (two of my favourite directors are Terrence Malick and David Lynch), but _Tenet_ isn't an especially experimental film – it's a humourless and badly written shambles, convinced of its own portentousness, and created by a man who has achieved such popularity that it seems no one in his circle is willing to tell him when something is a bad idea.\r\n\r\nSpending almost ten years working on the story, and five writing the script, in Tenet, Nolan is yet again examining the vagaries of time. It's a theme that's front and centre in _Memento_ (2000), _Inception_ (2010), _Interstellar_ (2014), and _Dunkirk_ (2017), and to a lesser extent in _Following_ (1998) and _The Prestige_ (2006) (I haven't seen any of his _Dark Knight_ trilogy so I can't attest to their thematic concerns, and we shall not speak of his remake of _Insomnia_). It's undeniably fascinating to see a tent pole Hollywood production engaging with issues such as entropy, thermodynamics, reversibility and irreversibility, time's arrow, the grandfather paradox, and T-symmetry, all the while keeping proceedings housed firmly within the spy genre (it's a Bond movie in all but name). Indeed, one of the film's central questions is especially noteworthy – if what and who we remember from our past defines who we are in our present, do things that haven't happened to us yet also speak to our identity? Do our future actions determine who we are as much as our past actions? It's a fascinating question. And one with which Nolan does precisely nothing. However, the film's main problems aren't related to the squandered existential potential, the much-ballyhooed complexity, the puzzle-like structure, the philosophical musing, or the thematic similarity to Nolan's previous work. Rather, they are more fundamental, existing almost entirely at a structural level (although some of the performances don't help matters, nor does the abysmal sound mixing). The film looks incredible, the practical effects in the action scenes are extraordinarily mounted, the cinematography is stunning, and the editing is superb, but there simply isn't anything of note under the shiny veneer. It's a film with virtually no interest in human beings.\r\n\r\nThe premise of _Tenet_ is straightforward in outline. The film opens as a CIA operative known only as The Protagonist (John David Washington) infiltrates a team of bad guys looking to find a spy at the Kiev Opera House. He finds the man before they do, but during their escape, he sees something which should be impossible – a bullet seems to travel backwards in space and a bullet hole is \"un-shot\", as if time is reversed for that bullet, even though everything else is moving normally. The Protagonist is able to smuggle the spy outside, but their escape goes awry, and to avoid being captured, he swallows a cyanide tablet. Rather than dying, however, he awakens to be told that he has passed the test to join an ultra-secret international espionage squad known as Tenet. His mission is fairly simply – at some point in the future, someone has figured out how to reverse the entropy of objects, effectively being able to send them back along the timeline without having to reverse time itself. The implications of this are catastrophic and have set humanity on course for World War III, and probable extinction, unless The Protagonist can figure out who is doing it and put a stop to their machinations. Along the way, he makes the acquaintance of Neil (Robert Pattinson), his infinitely better-informed handler; Andrei Sator (a spectacularly miscast Kenneth Branagh giving new meaning to clichéd villainy), a dangerous Russian oligarch; Kat Barton (Elizabeth Debicki), Andrei's oppressed and deeply unhappy trophy wife; Priya (Dimple Kapadia), an arms dealer; Ives (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a Tenet soldier; Michael Crosby (Michael Caine), a British intelligence bigwig; and Barbara (Clémence Poésy), a scientist specialising in all things temporal.\r\n\r\n_Tenet_ is an event movie in every way; this 150-minute, $200m+ original idea (when was the last time a non-franchise, non-comic book original movie got that kind of budget) is a massive studio tent pole written and directed by the most popular filmmaker alive. And I will say this. The budget is on the screen. Oftentimes, you'll see a movie that's cost a ridiculous amount and you'll sit there thinking, \"they must have spent a lot on catering.\" With _Tenet_, however, it's all there, front and centre. No small amount of that money, of course, must have gone on the practical effects (incredibly, the film has only 280 vfx shots) – whether it be our heroes bungie-jumping onto the side of a building, a close-quarters fight where one of the combatants moves in reverse, a Boeing 747 jet crashing into a building (which was shot for real), a highway chase where some of the cars are going forward in time and others are going backwards, or an all-out battle scene where, again, some of the soldiers travel forward whilst others move in reverse. Even Ludwig Göransson's score gets in on the act, employing only melodies which sound the same whether played backwards or forwards.\r\n\r\nAs cinematic spectacle goes (on a purely visual level), I've never quite seen anything like it. It's one of those films where you'll genuinely be asking yourself, \"how the hell did they do that?\"; a question that's become increasingly rare in our CGI-reliant times. Tenet looks like it was an exceptionally difficult movie to make. Along the same lines, the cinematography by the great Hoyte van Hoytema (_The Fighter_; _Spectre_; _Ad Astra_) is stunning, with van Hoytema mixing 15-perf 70mm IMAX film (shot at 1.43:1; projected at 1.90:1) with traditional 70mm stock (2.20:1) and a few 35mm sequences in a manner where the shifts in aspect ratio are barely noticeable (although I saw it on an IMAX screen; aspects shifts would be more obvious on a smaller screen). It's the kind of film that could only exist in the medium of cinema – no other artform could even begin to approximate its aesthetic design and splendour, and I admire that a great deal. A celluloid purist, Nolan has always made a big stink about the artistic importance of cinema, and _Tenet_ finds him pushing the aesthetic boundaries of what the artform can accomplish, foregrounding innovation in ways that big budget mainstream studio productions simply don't, and celebrating the possibilities it affords those with sufficient enough imagination.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no matter how visually unique or aesthetically impressive it may be, no amount of gloss can hide the fact that the screenplay is a turgid mess and suffers from some fundamental problems – most notably, it's bereft of emotion and populated with cardboard cut-outs that are supposed to be characters. The problems start early when The Protagonist is told that the future of humanity depends on his mission. This is precisely when I started to tune out. Any film that declares its story is none-other than saving humanity has gone so big as to render the people who populate its narrative as insignificant. It's also a cliché, it's dull as dishwater, and we've seen it done a million-and-one-times. The idea of saving all mankind simply doesn't pack any kind of emotional punch any more, far better to stay smaller and focus on character.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to those characters. Good lord, they're badly written. The Protagonist isn't a person with an interiority; he's a cipher, the audience's surrogate so that Nolan can explain the plot to us. But there's nothing more to him – he's utterly emotionless, seemingly void of any kind of relatable motivation, has no psychological through line, and nothing even resembling a character arc. I'm not a huge fan of Washington in general, who I feel has played every part in the same sombre, disinterested manner, so there could be some prejudice at work, but I am a huge fan of Branagh, and he's even worse. Think of the most clichéd Russian villain you've ever seen. Now square that and you'll be some way towards imagining how ludicrous Sator is. He isn't a person – he's a collection of near-satirical tics, clichés, and elements from other, better films. Maybe with a more menacing actor in the role it might have worked, but all I could think whenever he was on screen was \"that accent is hilarious.\" Pattinson's Neil and Debicki's Kat fair better, but neither set the screen alight. Along the same lines, much of the second half of the film hinges on the fact that The Protagonist and Kat find themselves drawn to one another, yet Washington and Debicki have zero chemistry. At a human level, there's nothing to take a hold of the audience, nothing to make us care about any of these people; they're gears in the machinery of Nolan's plot.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Kat, a common criticism of Nolan's filmography as a whole is that his female characters tend to be victims whose deaths motivate men or who need saving by men, and/or women who define themselves almost entirely in terms of their relationship to men. Now, I'm not saying that Nolan is _obliged_ to write more rounded female characters. He isn't. Much like one of his favourite filmmakers, Michael Mann, Nolan's films are androcentric. And there's nothing wrong with that. However, in Mann, there are to be found strong female characters with considerable agency, whereas in _Tenet_, Kat is nothing more than a pawn in a game played by powerful men who effortlessly control her. She defines herself almost entirely in terms of her role as a self-sacrificing mother, and whilst this is an interesting trait the first couple of times it comes up, by the time Nolan is reminding us of how much she has sacrificed for the 237th time, it had become obvious that this was going to be the extent of her characterisation.\r\n\r\nAt one point early in the film, Barbara tells The Protagonist, \"_don't try to understand it, just feel it_\", which is advice that Nolan is also offering to his audience. The problem is that there's nothing to feel. _Tenet_ is a puzzle, the impenetrability of which will depend on each individual viewer (and how much of the appallingly poorly-mixed dialogue you can make out), but unlike _Memento_ (which remains Nolan's best by a long way), which packed a seriously emotional gut-punch when we finally learn what was at the heart of the puzzle, _Tenet_ offers us nothing more than the task of deciphering it for its own sake. There's a twist towards the end that I literally saw coming from about 10 minutes in, but aside from that, there's no payoff. There's nothing to make us want to penetrate a story that seems more intent on reminding us how clever it is instead of trying to depict real people or establish real emotional stakes; it's a film more enamoured by the complexity of its own design than by any of the people contained within. It's an emotional void – all technical virtuosity and surface sheen with next to nothing at its core."

Also, we do not see any coherent story during the film and the events of the film do not form a script at all. There is no characterization in the film, the protagonist character is not made at all and is not believable, also the other characters are completely caricatured and extra, also during the film and its artificial communication, not a bit of feeling is created. Aside from the fact that the film does not even come close to form, it is also very beginner in terms of technique, excessive cuts, and sometimes weird and inappropriate! The opening and closing sequences of the film are highly artificial, and the final sequence is saturated with a large number of cuts, aerial shots and rudimentary special effects. The only slight positive aspect of the film is its acting, and the acting of the antagonist character is defensible. In general, the film is considered to be a very bad and weak film, which is like a puzzle without a pattern, meaning that after putting the white pieces together, which is not a difficult task, it has nothing to offer."

It is more often than not that the author gets it more or less spectacularly wrong and it turns into a mess.\r\n\r\nWell, I have to say that, in my mind, this movie was a bit of a mess. I felt confused and found it difficult to follow the various twists more than once. Also, at least in the beginning, the parts about bullets jumping up in your hand instead of falling out because the bullets where travelling backwards in time sounded somewhat unbelievable to me. I can accept something travelling backwards in time but for such a bullet to jump up into someone’s hand, seemingly on command, no I do not think that’s very believable at all.\r\n\r\nOnce I had watched the entire movie to the end, then finally, some of the first parts started to make sense. Personally I don’t like that I spend a large part of the movie wondering what the f… even if it (mostly) becomes clear towards the end.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to say, it was a quite cool mess.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I quite like the main protagonist. Whether he’s traveling forwards or backwards he kicks ass and he’s intelligent. He is very much a James Bond type of character which I like.\r\n\r\nThere’s also a shitload of action in this movie and it is both well done as well as cool. Of course, with the budget this movie had I would really be disappointed if there wasn’t good special effects in it. However, one thing that made the effects and action to stand out in this movie compared was this concept that for some people, and objects as well, time moved backwards. Watching some of the larger scenes where some explosions where actually explosions and some where implosions. Cars moving both forwards and backwards in car chases etc. etc. I have opinions about the plausibility of that but it looked cool at least.\r\n\r\nFor me the enjoyment of this movie was the main protagonist which I liked and the cool action. The story itself and its rather convoluted (but original I have to say that) time travel concept, well I’m not sure I was (am) too trilled about that except for the fact that it allowed these rather original special effects."

This one ditches his unconvincing attempts at emotional/philosophical depth and just focuses on the very creative core concept of inverted time. There's no labored soliloquies about the power of love, no epic aspirations of cultural poignancy - it's mainly just a bunch of exposition interspersed between some truly breathtaking visual and audio spectacle like nothing else. \r\n\r\nNolan is an artist first and foremost. His films always have a level of craft that is beyond comprehension for mere mortals like me. And in this one he turns that up to eleven. Honestly, I actually enjoyed the challenging sound design. It reminded me of the film Primer (another time bending mind melter) where the discussions about complicated ideas are drowned out by background noise and music because he knows we won't understand and it's not important anyway. What is important is that we \"feel it\" (as is literally said). \r\n\r\nDon't try to figure it out. Just enjoy that an arthouse abstractionist who somehow gets 100+ million dollar budgets to make quirky stories with set pieces that will blow your mind."

The entire plot is so purposefully convoluted that it is really hard to follow. Christopher Nolan whips from one scene to another so fast to cram as much exposition in that so many moments just got right over the audience's head. Half the scenes are just exposition dumps with audio so poorly done that you have to read the subtitles the entire time to even understand what they're saying. The acting is all fine in this movie, but I spent so much time trying to understand the film that any mishaps could have gone right over my head. The only redeeming aspect of this film is the fights and heists. These scenes were filmed with incredible precision that really showed off the scope that the protagonist was trying to accomplish. I had a good time with that, but that was few and far between.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Poor_"

What Nolan is trying to convey to the viewers is an adventure that is difficult to imagine on your own. It is also difficult to imagine its events and facts.

Fear that my mind will be distracted by this wonderful drama.\r\n\r\nThe story of the film is about the attempt of some people to stop the end of the world. This person is known in this film as the Protagonist, as he does not know anything about the mission or how to end the world except for one word, which is Tenet, and the meaning of this word will appear through the events of the film, but frankly, the aesthetic of talking about this film lies In penetrating the events and talking comfortably about the events of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe photography was aesthetic with things that neither the mind nor the eye could have expected while you were sitting in front of the screen. The photographic ability in this film exceeded many stages and reached a stage of dazzling. It exceeded the choice of angles or even the duration of the shot. We have different dimensions and a new method in how to photograph.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetic of the story is not in asking ourselves what the story is. The aesthetic of the story is in how the story is told and explained. The narrative of the story and the photographic capabilities greatly exceeded the events of the story and anything else in the film, where scientific and physical facts and theories were used that greatly assist in storytelling. They greatly help in explaining the events and how they pass. Events and these scientific theories and physical facts that boggle your mind and drive you crazy have made my eyes stop closing while my time to sleep came."

        "content": "When audiences last saw Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy); the journalist and his parasitic symbiote Venom; had just saved the day and cemented their unusual bond with one another.\r\n\r\nIn the new film “Venom: Let There Be Carnage”; Eddie and Venom are at the end of their Honeymoon phase as Venom is lingering to be free to eat bad people and do what is natural for him. Eddie meanwhile wants a more conservative approach feeding Venom chicken and chocolate as he knows the eyes of the authorities are still upon him and he has to convince the world that Venom is dead and no longer a threat.\r\n\r\nAt the same time; serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) has selected Eddie to interview him in San Quentin and the two form an unusual connection as Cletus cryptically speaks to Eddie which underlines a deeper motivation.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Venom; Eddie is able to decipher clues found on the walls of Cletus’s cell which leads authorities to several of his victims. This results in a rapid rise in status for Eddie and fast tracks Cletus for execution as his main means of leverage is now gone.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a rift where Eddie and Venom split and each has to struggle to adjust to life without one another.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the film has mainly been odd bits of whimsy between Venom and Eddie around the establishment of the plot and threat. However, things go into chaos mode when Cletus becomes infected with a Symbiote and turns into a destruction spewing death machine known as “Carnage”.\r\n\r\nCletus and Carnage both have their own agendas and Cletus uses Carnage to exact his revenge as well as locate a figure from his past that is as big a danger as he is.\r\n\r\nAs any fan of films of this genre knows; this scenario leads to a showdown between the central characters which are awash in abundant CGI, loud noises, and destruction. While this is not a bad thing and certainly one of the main reasons I enjoy films of this type; the film never seemed to fully click for me and as such was not as good as I thought it could have been.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, the film reminded me of how comic-based films were done before Marvel started their own studios and their phenomenal run of hits based on their work.\r\n\r\nThere have been multiple attempts to adapt comics into films over the last few decades and many of them have not lived up to expectations or failed outright. One of the biggest reasons is in my opinion is that those behind the projects were hindered by the studio, wanted to put their own spin on the material and strayed from the source; or failed to show the attributes that made the characters so appealing to fans.\r\n\r\nWhat we often get is action sequences and CGI galore but without stories or characters that fully draw in the audience and fail to capture the essence of the comics.\r\n\r\nDirector Andy Serkis has done a great job with the visuals of the film but the tone seems off. The early part of the film is filled with comedic moments that are either hit or miss. Some of which was almost to the point where I wondered if it was supposed to be a parody.\r\n\r\nThe plot is fairly linear with nothing unexpected as it is simply bad guys get loose; bad guys cause death and destruction, can the heroes stop them. The climactic scene lacks any “wow” moments for me as it was mainly CGI characters rapidly moving around causing damage to one another and their environment. There was no real tension for me and the ultimate resolution seemed a bit anti-climactic.\r\n\r\nFor me the best moment of the film was a mid-credits scene that really popped as it sets up all sorts of interesting options and indicates that Venom may be about to graduate to bigger and better things.\r\n\r\nFor now; the cast is solid as is the CGI; I just wish the story was more engaging as it had the potential to be so much more.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5"

The story regarding the birth of Carnage is different than the comic but works in the time they used to show this story.  The movie does not give a ton of back story on the dual villains in the story but they show the love they have for one another.  \r\n\r\nThe movie is short and very fast pace.  It also has plenty of comedy between the hosts and the symbiotes.  \r\n\r\nOverall the movie sets up for a Venom 3 and an inclusion of Venom into the MCU.  If the relationship between Sony & Marvel can continue to be good fans of the franchise will have a bright future ahead."

Once a bad guy (though not in this universe apparently) he now tries to do the right thing while keeping within acceptable norms to exist among humans.  \r\nThis movie was a good attempt but, it came across as contrived and a bit cookie cutter as far as the bad guys, Woody Harrelson and Naomi Harris, were portrayed.  Psychoes enjoying newfound freedom after a fail death sentence, and lifelong incarceration is soooooo....bland.  In short, \"It's been done (before).\"  \r\n\r\nThe story from there is hit 'n miss with comedy, plot, and tension.  The movie pretty much happens in that manner as well.  It jumps as if each of the scenes are little movies banded together with no smooth transitions : Hardy really needs to workout or pass the character to someone else; his age is showing.  Harrelson and Harris' characters really didn't mesh, the half deaf cop never really fit into the story, we didn't hear enough from Carnage, and Venom's night out didn't actually go anywhere.  \r\n\r\nThe vibe of the movie felt clunky.\r\n\r\nI'll always like Venom.  But this was not particularly thrilling.  There is mixed opinion on which of the two movies is better.  I'll have to fall into the camp of those who liked the first Venom movie.  The second, more than not, simply let me down.  So, I will wait and see if another company can do better with the character than its predecessors.  3/5 stars."

A task that should be easy, but Incheon is not as deserted as they thought it would be.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of action scenes and good visual effects, Peninsula failed in the casting of the support roles. The main actors are pretty good, but the acting of the foreigner (that is, non-Korean) characters is laughable. Also, parts of the plot and some actions scenes are highly implausible, to say the least.\r\n\r\nHowever, Peninsula is still a very good movie, ranking high in the \"Best Zombie Movies\" list.

Therefore, I couldn't help but feel incredibly excited about another installment set in the same world. It's not a direct sequel to the original's story, but it seems to be placed just after the pandemic began. Unfortunately, it ends up being a huge disappointment.\r\n\r\nDespite the jaw-dropping stunt work and the extremely intense action sequences, the reason why Peninsula's predecessor works so well is due to its focus on the characters. By giving them a compelling development and a strong emotional bond, the zombie outbreak becomes instantly more effective because of our immense concern for everyone involved. Every technical element is dialed up to its maximum, transforming the film into an emotionally devastating, heart-wrenching story.\r\n\r\nYeon Sang-ho tries to follow a shortcut to achieve that same emotion of his previous movie, dooming this \"sequel\" from the very beginning. Every relationship feels forced, and the supposedly heartbreaking decisions/events are a complete target miss. Even the action scenes fail to live up to the original's level due to excessive CGI in ridiculous car chases. Every fifteen minutes, a major logical issue arises, and some characters are either straight-up dumb or unbelievably smart for their age/experience. Peninsula takes the realistic environment established by Train to Busan and fictionalizes it way too much.\r\n\r\nRating: C-"

It is too long, and at times it drags a little - but director Seong Hun Kim manages to create one of the more authentic looking desert adventures featuring loads of gunfire, some rabid dogs, a fun car chase down an alleyway and I found this to be way more watchable than some more recent, bigger budget, action films with Hollywood stars atop them. It's a fun watch this, with a good dynamic between the two men on their quest; the script is occasionally quite funny and the whole thing has a sort of light-heartedness to it that I quite enjoyed. Based on a true story, too - who'd be an emissary?"

        "content": "13 Fanboy is so bad it makes Halloween Kills look like a masterpiece in comparison. This movie is like Wes Craven's New Nightmare minus the budget, talent, visual effects, creativity, and intelligence. \r\n\r\nSome of these shortcomings are because this horror movie co-written and directed by Deborah Voorhees (whose last name helped her land an audition and win a role in Friday the 13th: A New Beginning) is, as the title suggests, a glorified fan film that has no official connection to the Friday the 13th franchise — but then neither did Friday the 13th: The Series, and yet that TV show was an entertaining product that went beyond exploiting an intellectual property to which it was attached by the most tenuous of links.\r\n\r\n“An obsessed fan stalks his favorite actors from the Friday the 13th films and beyond ... The cast includes a myriad of real life actors and actresses from the Friday the 13th films as well as iconic scream queens” (IMDb).\r\n\r\nThe first problem with this is that Friday the 13th, unlike Nightmare on Elm Street, Hellraiser, or Halloween, doesn't have an iconic scream queen, so Voorhees was forced to borrow them from other movies: for example Dee Wallace, who in the 70s and 80s appeared in The Hills Have Eyes, The Howling, Cujo, and Critters, and in the 2000s in Rob Zombie's Halloween\r\n\r\nAs for the \"myriad\" of \"favorite actors\", the killer must be the only person on the face of the planet able to recognize them and distinguish any particular one from the others. Lar Park Lincoln? Judie Aronson? Tracie Savage? Jennifer Banko?\r\n\r\nThese are names so esoteric that Voorhees herself doesn’t trust the audience to be able to identify them, so she plasters the screen with their names, their characters’ names, and the movies in which they appeared. \r\n\r\nI can understand that C.J. Graham, by the nature of his character, would be unrecognizable, but even Kane Hodder who, mask or no mask, is arguably the 'poster child' of this franchise, gets the equivalent of 'name, rank, and serial number'. The question is, if Voorhees didn't make this movie for the kind of viewer who would instantly recognize Kane Hodder, for whom exactly did she make it?\r\n\r\nAll this demolishing of the fourth wall is a deliberate choice as well as a necessity brought on by the public's understandable ignorance of who the fuck these people are, so here’s another question: why even bother with this meta-bullshit? Why not just go full-on film-a-clef? \r\n\r\nInstead of real-life nobodies (and the cumbersome, intrusive exposition they cause), you could have fictional characters standing in for some of the actors who actually became household names post-Friday the 13th; that is, characters that would be, albeit justifiably so, as unknown to the viewers as Mr. Graham and Mrs. Banko, and at the same time belong to a familiar frame of reference. \r\n\r\nSince I’ve mentioned Graham twice, I’d be remiss if I didn’t observe that he takes in this movie’s single memorable moment; face to face (or, rather, face to mask) with the villain, who confesses he’s \"been waiting my whole life to fight you, Jason\" (although only a few scenes ago he had already fought Hodder), Graham blurts out: \"What do you say, boy? You want a shot at the title?,\" his delivery punctuated by a conveniently timed flash of lightning. \r\n\r\nThis and no other is the spirit in which this film should have been made; with enough of a sense of humor to be able to make fun of itself. Unfortunately, Voorhees takes her material too seriously — almost as if she believed she's actually related to Jason."

Using a combination of guile and brass neck, he is soon in situ, where he encounters the cynical journalist Arthur Coates (Russell Crowe) before embarking on his trek to deliver his beer. If it were not fact, it would really beggar belief this - the hand that serendipity plays in ensuring not just his safety, but the manner in which he blags his way around this tortured land, is sometimes just a little too difficult to believe. Efron is never going to be a good versatile actor, but to give him his due he delivers well enough here with a decent script and once we enter the final phase that involves more of a contribution from Crowe, the film picks up giving us some indication of just how perilous life was for those facing the Viet Cong's stealthy advance. It's not without it's humour and it illustrates amusingly just how afraid everyone was of falling foul of the CIA - a confusion which he was able to take advantage of on a regular basis! It's a tale of camaraderie in it's truest form, and though not really a cinema film, is at the better end of the Apple productions we have seen so far. It is half an hour too long - it takes way too long to get going, but once we are in Asia, it's a watchable enough drama."

        "content": "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\nWhat bugs me the most about “The Greatest Beer Run Ever” is director Peter Farrelly’s indecisiveness. He can’t seem to pick a tone and stick with it. The first part is filled with lighthearted moments that make it seem like the film is a tailor-made crowd-pleasing movie. The last half of the film (and the strongest) is firm in its anti-war messaging. Farrelly tries to be too many things to too many people, and the result is a film that feels at odds with itself.\r\n\r\nSet in 1967, the film tells the true story of Chickie Donohue (Zac Efron), a man who wants to do something special to show his support for his neighborhood friends serving in Vietnam. He gets the outrageous idea to hand-deliver cans of beer to them on the front lines so they can have a little taste of home, and to show them that somebody back in New York still cares. When the locals start to encourage (and count on) Chickie to complete his mission, the man sets off for the jungles of Vietnam with a rucksack full of Pabst Blue Ribbon.\r\n\r\nIt’s a terrific story that should make a great film. The problem is that there isn’t much to the movie other than the premise. Some of the situations Chickie finds himself in are ridiculous, and there’s no complexity to the story at all. It’s as straightforward as they come, in what I can only presume was a conscious effort by Farrelly to keep it easily accessible for mainstream audiences.\r\n\r\nThe film briefly touches on the political and social impacts of the Vietnam War, including the division between Chickie’s family and friends. The film gets better once he heads back to Saigon and the story settles into its strong anti-war stance. It’s heavy-handed in its “war is hell” messaging, and it’s where the film gets away from its actors.\r\n\r\nEfron is fine as the film’s leading man, but the role requires a depth that seems to be a bit too much of a stretch for him at this point in his career. He’s talented, but is asked to do more than he’s comfortably capable. Bill Murray is a high point of the film, although he only makes a very brief appearance as the neighborhood barkeep. The best work comes from Russell Crowe as a photojournalist.\r\n\r\nThere are some memorable scenes in “The Greatest Beer Run Ever,” but they will be soon forgotten under the weight of the film’s boilerplate script. Just because the movie is based on an interesting true story doesn’t automatically make it a winner."

These arches are so honest and vulnerable, I found very compelling.\r\n\r\nThe performances were top notch all around, and I would expect nothing more from a stacked cast of actors including Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt. But the surprise of the bunch was Diego Calva. He was fantastic and stole many scenes he was featured in with both Robbie and Pitt. He is the true lead of this film and does an excellent job bearing the load.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed almost aspects of the film, but towards the end there are some sequences that I feel got away from Chazelle. They are so over the top and kind of feal out of place in this somewhat grounded story. The tension is there in these scenes, but it just doesn't fit.

A tale that starts off with all the excesses and hedonism of the cocaine fuelled, sexually lascivious antics where even an elephant isn't too much for a party hosted by a movie mogul. It's here we meet the three characters who provide the thread for the rest of this maelstrom of a movie. Firstly we have the young, naive, but quick-thinking \"Manny\" (Diego Calva) who manages to attract the attention of the much-married, established and former silent screen star \"Jack Conrad\" (Brad Pitt) all whilst Margot Robbie's ambitious and outrageous \"Nellie LaRoy\" is sniffing, snorting, dancing and generally sexifying everything she touches as she bids to get into the acting business. What now ensues is a really well crafted and thoughtfully entertaining tale of the rise and fall and rise and fall of these three characters and of how their success brings failure as surely as the sun comes up. Robbie is on excellent form, a truly convincing performance as a character ill-equipped for the journey she is so determined to undertake. Pitt, likewise, plays well here. His character has less in the way of shock factor to deliver, but that storyline offers us a rather more effectively stolid appreciation of just how fickle success can be: there, then gone - in what might seem like a blind of the eye. Finally, the aspirational but (initially) more measured, head-screwed-on Calva who falls in love, and ends up trying to fight the inevitable like King Canute! There's a quirky effort from Tobey Maguire, an alligator and a rat-eater; and a rather scene-stealing contribution - especially at the end - from Jean Smart's Hedda Hopper-style gossip journalist \"Elinor St. John\" - possibly the only honest character in the entire thing! It's a pastiche and/or an homage to all things cinema at a time of the gradual emergence and then dominance of sound pictures, and we are frequently exposed to the car-crash lifestyles as everyone adapted, re-adapted, and continued to stay on their toes as their industry and their audiences did not always want to take everyone with them - and at break neck speed too - as tastes changed. It's got everything from Cecil B DeMille to Baz Luhrmann to it, takes a swipe at the pompous-thinking stage theatricals (from the East Coast), the shallowness of the whole industry - and yet, it never loses a sense the these are still people. Human beings! It is not difficult to imagine Kenneth Anger advising on the script - it \"could\" all be true\". Maybe a bit on the long side, it certainly sags now and again - but it's definitely a big screen experience that delivers solid, engaging performances that are not over reliant on - even, rather comically (and dangerously) illustrating just how films were made before - CGI! No point in waiting for this to come to television - it's a must for the cinema around which it's story is told."

It's an extended series of disparate Melanie Martinez music videos with a wafer-thin membrane of overarching connective tissue. If you are a fan of her music, then, obviously, you should probably watch _K-12_, not even just to \"support her\" but because her music is what makes up 90% of the runtime. Personally though, I don't care for it, which I figured meant the best option I was left with was to basically ignore all that, and just judge _K-12_ on the narrative. Which is not great. Bad, even, I think I could argue. I know that that's not the point, it's not an actual story, it's a music presentation. But to watch this **as a movie** it doesn't work. I even watched _K-12_ with somebody who specifically does like Melanie Martinez's music, and even she was yelling at the screen's nonsense. The pastel colour scheme/lolita fashion thing is also not my speed, but I appreciate the dedication to it. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"

Do we have to use it in every other sentence? After all, when the writing gets a bit serious or romantic, the swearing disappears. But maybe even the overuse of cursing is a form of satire. In any case, it was laugh out loud funny for me at other times and harmless fun, and even if you don't find it as entertaining as I did, it is under 90 minutes long, so stick it out and let yourself join in at laughing at your relationship with your phone.

A rabbi asks him if will act as a \"Shomer\" - a person who sits with the deceased to recite prayers and generally ward off any evil before burial. As he watches over the body, the usual spooky things start to happen - lights flicker; things go bump etc; and on that score it's all a pretty routine horror flick; but as his fears start to build, he begins to confront his own demons as much as he must the predatory \"Mazzik\" that feeds from his fears. Save for a few short appearances from the widow - Lynn Cohen, it's essentially a single-hander and Davis does an OK job - aided by the drearily-lit room and some suitably tense - if frequently over-the-top musical accompaniment.

There’s a cute little girl (Matilda Lawler), a fuzzy squirrel (created from choppy CGI), and a story that throws in a handful of positive life lessons, but the slapdash action scenes, dumb pratfalls, and dull storytelling combine to form a family film with an unredeemable lack of magic.\r\n\r\nFlora (Lawler) is an avid comic book fan and cynic, who is having trouble dealing with the fact that her parents (Alyson Hannigan, Ben Schwartz) have recently separated. One day, the 10-year-old girl saves a squirrel who has been sucked into a vacuum cleaner. Flora names her rescued pal Ulysses after she discovers he possesses superhero powers (and can write poetry). The duo go on a series of adventures while avoiding an animal control officer (Danny Pudi) who wants to capture and kill the potentially rabid squirrel.\r\n\r\nThe film feels like a dated Disney flick, with a simple message that relies heavily on mom and dad style humor. There is a good theme of what being a “true hero” means wrapped up with a couple of platitudes about the importance of family, but the more positive ideas seem buried under the lifeless action scenes (and dopey slow motion) that makes the project barely rise above the lowest quality t.v. movie.\r\n\r\nThere can’t be an unhappy ending of course, so Ulysses helps Flora fix the broken elements in her life. The little girl hopes her estranged parents will get back together and that her mom will be able to rise above her writer’s block. She wishes humans would treat animals better too, and thankfully her new squirrel buddy convinces most of them that he’s worth saving.\r\n\r\nIf you or your kids really like squirrels, are very bored, and are easily entertained, then “Flora and Ulysses” may be good enough for family movie night. The film starts out really rough and despite a mild improvement about halfway through, it never gets over the hump of mediocrity."

        "content": "QT8: The First Eight is the wrong title for this documentary/hagiography of Quentin Tarantino. Never mind the cacophony of of having two 'eights' (even if it is, as I suspect, a reference to the Crazy 88, it’s still pretty lame); a more accurate title would be The First Three That Actually Matter and the Six (counting Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) Bloated, Masturbatory, Overrated Ego Trips that Followed.\r\n\r\nLike it or lump it, there is a 'before and after' Jackie Brown. Tarantino’s transition from genius to raving lunatic began with Kill Bill, and reached an apex with the pointless exercises in historic revisionism that are Inglorious Basterds and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nBack to QT8, I would normally dismiss a documentary about a living person wherein that person is conspicuous by his absence as nothing more than a fucking waste of everybody’s time — in this case, however, I’ll file it under 'addition by subtraction.' Arguably the best thing about this movie is that Tarantino is nowhere to be seen or heard.\r\n\r\nThe second best thing about about the film are the contributions of Michael Madsen, Sam Jackson, and Christoph Waltz (and, to a lesser extent, Tim Roth, Bruce Dern, Kurt Russell, and Jamie Foxx). Their interventions are entertaining and insightful, and carry the weight of credibility. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, when I hear some nobody saying \"Watching [Reservoir Dogs] with enough audiences ... [Tarantino] realized that he needed to give the audience permission to laugh,\" I’m like, you’re not telling me what he thought; at best, you’re telling me what _you_ think _he_ though — then again, that’s par for the course in a documentary where everything, regardless of whether the source is trustworthy or not, is secondhand information.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, Tarantino is not there to explain the actions that led him to almost killing Uma Thurman and apologize for them — not that he needs to, though; since this is a Quentin lovefest, the blame somehow gets shifted to Harvey Weinstein, which is a bad move even if Weinstein is bad himself; blame the man, and rightfully so, for the crap he’s done (god knows there’s plenty of that), nor for the crap he didn’t do just, especially not just so you can get your golden boy off the hook.\r\n\r\nAt one point, to illustrate Tarantino’s infectious enthusiasm, Waltz says \"It's like going to a whore house to get infected with the syphilis.\" I’m sure it sounded better in his head, but this ill-conceived simile unwittingly makes a good point. I’m reminded of Doctor Faustus, a novel by Waltz’s compatriot Thomas Mann, whose hero literally and willingly contracts syphilis because he equates madness with artistic genius; the ensuing progressive disease reduces him to an infantile state in which he lives out the remainder of his short life under the care of his relatives. I’m going to go out on a limb and assume that Tarantino doesn’t have syphilis — but then, what’s his excuse?"

Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.\r\n\r\nAs if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.\r\n\r\nDesperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.\r\n\r\nAs more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.\r\n\r\nThe film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.\r\n\r\nWhile there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.\r\n\r\nThere is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5"

It surpassed my expectations in every way possible, to the point that I'd say it beats <em>'Avengers: Endgame'</em> as my favourite production from the MCU. This is a next level superhero movie, it's easily the most I've consistently enjoyed a film in this series and genre - no question.\r\n\r\nThe cast are all outstanding, it's ace how they work everyone in from previous iterations of <em>'Spider-Man'</em> - even away from the main universe. Seeing Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire together onscreen as Peter Parker is tremendous. The film does it in the perfect way, at no point does it feel forced or needless and the humour between the trio is excellent; in fact, the whole film is funny when it intends to be.\r\n\r\nZendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon (his best showing of the trilogy), Jon Favreau and Marisa Tomei also add positives things to this 2021 film. Jamie Foxx, Alfred Molina and, most pleasing for me, Willem Dafoe all reprise their characters from past releases and are all a joy. I'm a fan of Dafoe so was particularly happy to see him reappear.\r\n\r\nOnto what we see onscreen. The plot is great and I wouldn't change anything about it, there is one or two things that I had question marks about whilst watching but those quickly dissipated. The pacing is top notch and the music is superb, the respective screen times of everybody was pinpoint and, along with the already noted humour, the film also packs a punch on a more serious level to boot.\r\n\r\nThis really is top tier Marvel! Would watch again, would recommended etc. Awesome!"

I would very much have liked a Peter Parker / Spider Man that behaved like a real superhero instead of this naïve kid who constantly thinks he knows better than the grown ups and, of course, constantly bungles things up.\r\n\r\nIn addition I was not too thrilled about the story itself where Spider Man right at the beginning is framed as the bad guy. I know, I know, it is rather consistent with the original comics but Hollywood do not hesitate so change things if they feel like it so why not make a good change for once?\r\n\r\nThe good thing about this movie is the special effects. They are quite cool. Especially the parts in this weird space where Doctor Strange and Spider Man dukes it out. Unfortunately that is pretty much it.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie is really dragged down by the childish and stupid behavior of Peter Parker. Him being a real idiot and constantly trying to change the spell was just cringe worthy. Then he continues screwing things up because he do not want notorious criminals to go back to their real place because they will actually die there. Typical Hollywood sob story. Despite what that dumb bitch said towards the end, yes Peter Parker you did something wrong, you screwed up big time and the wrong people died because of it.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that was really annoying throughout the movie was listening to that moron Jonah Jameson from The Daily Bugle. He was spewing almost as much fake news as CNN and it just pissed me off every time he was on screen.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame really. One would have thought that, given that they already did the young and immature Spider Man in Spider Man: Far From Home, they could have made him more experienced and mature in this one. You know, character advancement.\r\n\r\nInstead they just piled on the childish, naïve and immature behavior with a good dose of juvenile jokes making what, with some actual intelligent script writing, could have been a great movie with all those cool special effects (and I really do like Doctor Strange) to be one just barely watchable."

The massive combined gravitas generated by Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx would be enough to save any other movie; the problem is that this film is not theirs to save, and it’s barely a film at all to begin with – it’s more like the superhero equivalent of that Pink Panther movie they made with spare parts from previous Pink Panther movies.\r\n\r\nIf I want Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, why not just revisit 2002’s Spider-Man? Similarly, if I have a hankering for Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, why not just rewatch 2004’s Spider-Man 2? The latter was, according to Roger Ebert, “the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with \"Superman\"”. How the mighty have fallen. It’s great to see Dafoe and Molina sharing screen time, but once the novelty – or rather the nostalgia – wears off, we are left with only a reminder of how comparatively superior Sam Raimi’s trilogy was, as well as a testament of how downhill things have gone since then.\r\n\r\nWhen Molina finally arrives, following an excruciatingly dumb, seemingly endless first half hour, he does so like a godsend; unfortunately, as much as we welcome the company of someone with a gleam of intelligence in his eyes, Doc Ock’s edge has been dulled by poor stylistic choices – first, his mechanical tentacles are 100% computer-generated (as opposed to Spider-Man 2, which used CGI to enhance, but not fully replace, a set of prop tentacles), and second, Molina was digitally de-aged (as was Dafoe), though in this case, unlike for example The Irishman, the unintended uncanny valley effect might have been a blessing in disguise; after all, Doc Ock is supposed to be a comic book villain, so that grotesqueness actually becomes him.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, everything and everyone endemic to the MCU Spider-Man is as flat and artificial as cardboard (our sympathy inevitably lies with the villains because, goblins and octopuses though they may be, they remain at all times more human – and certainly have a cleverer sense of humor – than any of the heroes with the exception of Tobey Maguire, and while Spider-Man may prevail over Norman Osborne, Dafoe totally obliterates Holland in terms of acting); at the same time, all the best parts are almost exclusively lifted from the work – and not even the best work at that – of a much more talented filmmaker. To put it bluntly, Spider-Man: No Way Home has absolutely no reason for being."

Allison's initial reaction is to laugh incredulously, and rightfully so; this is an incredibly stupid idea, not only as a parenting method (which of course doesn't stop people from practicing it in real life; e.g., Garner herself), but also as a movie plot – at best, this is sitcom material (in fact, Nickelodeon’s Victorious used the same premise about eight years ago).\r\n\r\nThat notwithstanding, she obviously will end up saying yes to this, and to several other things; otherwise there would be no film (we should be so lucky).

Cigarettes are not just cigarettes; they symbolize the protagonists’ ennui.\r\n\r\nSmoking is not just killing yourself; it’s killing time. It’s a habit you pick up for lack of something better to do. There must be long, uneventful stretches aboard the spaceship in 3022, just like there were in the Nostromo (that is, before the characters get to the point where they’d rather be bored than dead).\r\n\r\nThe Pangea space station refuels spacecraft bound for Earth's first space colony, Europa One. Rotating crews from different countries maintain Pangea in 10-year shifts. Four American astronauts arrive to begin their term.\r\n\r\nThey are Captain John Laine (Omar Epps), Engineer Jackie Miller (Kate Walsh), Dr. Richard Valin (Angus Macfadyen), and Lisa Brown (Miranda Cosgrove). Jackie and Lisa must really like space, if they’re willing to leave to an infant daughter on Earth and spend the better part of their twenties, respectively, on a space station.\r\n\r\nThey certainly have no complaints for the first two years. By the third year, however, tedium begins to set in, which may partly explain John and Jackie's romantic relationship; sex being a reasonable substitute for tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe first lustrum is wordlessly and effectively summed up in the opening montage, a series of vignettes accompanied by a piano and strings. The plot proper is set in motion when Richard is forced to diagnose John, who suffers from, among other things, night terrors, with space madness (or words to that effect).\r\n\r\nJohn is not mentally capable of continuing to captain the mission, which for some reason means that the rest of the crew must also leave their posts, which in turn makes Jackie fear for the future of their careers. These concerns will soon become irrelevant when they discover an asteroid field where the late, great planet Earth used to be.\r\n\r\nEpps, Walsh, and Macfadyen do a good job forging their own unique paths to madness. As for tasty little Cosgrove, she doesn't have time to do much more than use language that will shock iCarly fans.\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s the special effects, which run the gamut from a distractingly phony fire to exterior (so to speak) shots reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey. 3022 is a much more modest effort, but a worthy one."

But there were some pretty good performances, set pieces, and brutal action that raised this movie from mediocrity.\r\n\r\nThe plot is incredibly bare bones: a plane gets damaged in a storm and crash lands on a desolate island. We've seen this used in countless films and TV shows throughout the years but, the way this is handled is pretty incredible. We see it from the pilots perspective as he and the stewards are trying to navigate the situation to create the best course of action to survive. It was done in a very believable way, giving us a glimpse at crash landing procedure and how truly indestructible planes are. The entire 30-minutes sequence had me on the edge of my seat even though I knew it was coming from a mile away. The CGI in this section was quite rough though as the plane looked like something rendered in an Xbox 360 game.\r\n\r\nThe movie does fall into some pretty classic tropes in movies like this. One being that almost all the \"good\" people are the classic white American men and woman, but the \"bad\" people (the island combatants and our main prisoner hero) are individuals of color. It is subtle, but something I noticed that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Also the depiction of how the Philippines refused to assist in their own territory was laughable. But it opened the way for the good men of the American military were there to save the day and kill some island terrorists. It has some minor military propaganda that didn't totally take away from my experience, but worth a mention. \r\n\r\nThe performances were all pretty good. Gerard Butler played his usual role, I enjoyed his charisma as a pilot but also the gruff and militaristic persona he pulled out from his previous service. Mike Colter was great as the ultimate badass of the movie, killing terrorists with whatever he could get his hands on. This was nothing against his performance, but I hated how they wrote his characters ending in the film. It did not do his character arch any justice and felt out of place. The rest of the cast was decent.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie delivers exactly what it promised in a short concise runtime and I cannot ask any more than that.\r\n\r\nScore: 63%\r\nVerdict: Decent"

However far from praised for his actions the passengers decide it’s rather an inconvenience and complain constantly as the crew try to repair the communications.

More deaths ensue, however Brodie and his new friend, Louis are the only two to avoid capture after killing a few rebels along the way. Brodie and Louis work together to dispatch more rebels in an attempt to rescue the hostages.\r\n\r\nWhat ensues is a Die Hard style action thriller but based at New Year rather than Christmas. “Plane” does have some tense moments but very much ticks every Die Hard trope box it can. What is extremely notable, much like Die Hard, a rather large number of rebels are killed compared to hostages.

Now we happen to know that one of his few charges was also under the charge of the police, and now \"Brodie\" and the erstwhile captive - and useful - \"Gaspare\" (Mike Colter) must unite to fend off the venal bandits lead by their chief \"Junmar\" (Evan Dane Taylor) whilst getting a message to the rescue parties that can hopefully come and save their bacon. This film is so far-fetched that you might as well leave any need for reality at the door as you go in. The dialogue is pedestrian and the plot lurches from one implausibly half-baked scenario to another with consummate ease. That said, it hots up nicely for the last twenty minutes of gunfighting and that does rescue it a little from the mediocrity it probably deserves. It passed an hour and an half in the cinema easily enough, but it is not a film you will ever remember watching."

Nothing less.**\r\n\r\nPlane is a low-budget action/survival movie that checks all the boxes and provides plenty of gritty Gun fights and brutal melee combat along the way. The film that didn’t spend much time picking a clever name also didn’t waste much time on character development. Instead, the plot is centered on Gerard Butler as he works to secure the safety and survival of a small group of passengers. Unfortunately, the island they crash-landed on is full of a bunch of pirate/terrorist types, so Butler does some shooting and punching, and choking to save the day. Plane won’t win any awards, but it is a solid action movie that I would watch again and recommend renting (probably not a whole $20 purchase to own, though) to any action fan. I’m glad it got a theatrical release so people can trust that it’s a little bigger budget and higher quality than most straight-to-stream action films."

When you watch the movie, you feel that it is a film in the early 2000s, and this makes you feel that you need to watch this type of movies from time to time. The movie managed to grab my attention because there is a factor of isolation. Isolation in the air while boarding the plane and the problems that occurred during take-off and after landing on the ground, which is the isolation of staying on the island.\r\n\r\nImagine you land the plane in an area controlled by separatists and the killers are people who don't follow the law. This movie has become a kind of survival, which is the struggle for survival, and these movies have a large type of viewers, regardless of the usual plot and the familiar and expected ending.\r\n\r\nIf i am from the kind of audience whose movies only depend on the plot, I will criticize the movie from beginning to end, but there are sometimes movies that you should watch for fun, like Plane 2023. Cinema is the art of conversation, but it is also an enjoyable experience. Each movie has a specific goal for viewers. This movie is for entertainment purpose."

        "content": "Let’s start at the top when talking about “End Zone 2,” billed as the long-awaited sequel to the 1965 horror film “End Zone.” The history of these films is completely fabricated. There wasn’t an original in the 60s and part two wasn’t really made in 1970 (although the clever filmmakers have created a very convincing IMDB page for their project). This supposed sequel is presented as a “restored” version of the original movie (which again, doesn’t really exist), making it a form of cinematic performance art where the audience may or not be in on the joke.\r\n\r\nSet fifteen years after the events depicted in “End Zone,” bullied high school football player turned cannibal Smash-Mouth is back to finish off the gaggle of cheerleaders who killed his mother. According to legend, the original film was a supposed horror cult classic that’s well known in genre circles for its missing final act. Again, none of this is actually true, but the back story is well-developed.\r\n\r\nIt’s a modern day movie that’s crafted in a way to make it look and feel like a genuine retro slasher flick. Through clever use of sound, well-placed film scratches and burns, and orange-tinged visuals, director August Kane nails the vintage tone so well that it’s easy to believe the film was made in the 1970s. The deliberately stiff acting, erratic editing style, costumes, and lighting all work to sell the grift even further.\r\n\r\nThe film’s clever tone and sense of humor are a perfect homage to those old slasher movies that you’d watch at slumber parties when you were a kid. There’s a genuinely creepy séance scene that would’ve scared me out of my wits when I was 11 years old (ditto the goofy looking Smash-Mouth, whose makeup reminded me a bit of Large Marge from “Pee Wee’s Big Adventure”), and the film brought me back to that time in my life. It’s an achievement to make a modern day film look and feel so much like one that’s decades old.\r\n\r\nDespite the silly humor in “End Zone 2,” a little goes a long way. The brevity of the film’s runtime definitely works in its favor. The ending doesn’t land, but Kane makes a valiant effort."

        "content": "_Most Likely to Murder_ disappoints on several levels. The major craft flaw--plot holes big enough to drive an SUV through--is a symptom of the basic content flaw. Which is: this film sends the message that bullies know what they're doing, and that you should stay out of their quarrels with their targets, because those quarrels are worse than none of your business. In fact, here the bullies are looking out for the safety of the community!\r\n\r\n**SPOILER ALERT:** this review will necessarily spoil the Big Reveal at the end, the one thing that makes sense of the anti-heroine's behavior. Anyone wishing to view the film first should read no further than this line.\r\n\r\nIf you've gotten this far, you know the overview. Casey Paulson was at the top of a girl's \"Junior High\" game. (That's odd; haven't they been calling it \"Middle School\" and expanding it from Grades 7-8 to 5-8 for the last twenty years or longer? But I digress.) Then, early in high school, she has it all: she's even a cheerleader, the top of the girls' social order in any school. Then, as we are supposed to believe, tragedy strikes. Fire breaks out in her home, kills her father, and burns her hair down to her scalp.\r\n\r\nFast-forward to the present day. She's coming back to school, wearing a wig. But two cheerleaders take her wig off and throw it in the toilet, as spiteful revenge for some seemingly petty slight that predated the fire. And when she shows up for class, wearing a wig that still smells a little rank, they start joking about that in class. Then at recess the cheer captain lays down the law on the bullies: stop, or you're off the squad. Another cheerleader decides to befriend Casey and bring her out of her shell.\r\n\r\nThat's not good enough for the bullies. They steal Casey's cellphone, lock it up in one of their lockers, and deliver an ultimatum: stay away from the girl who wanted to be her friend. So she does two things, one of which you can approve, the other, not so much. The good thing is that she smashes the lock on the locker where the thief-in-charge has put the cellphone, and takes her property back--without disturbing anything else. But then, at a critical moment when the squad is practicing a pyramid maneuver, Casey pulls the fire alarm. The distraction causes the pyramid to break--and the thief-in-chief falls and breaks her leg.\r\n\r\nThe school counselor investigates--but not too closely. Casey, of course, denies everything--after all, no witnesses.\r\n\r\nBut the other bully, who took part in the theft, won't let that go. So when Casey delivers a speech to let everybody know how important fire safety can be, this other girl records it on video and threatens to post it on-line. Excuse me? If she just delivered that speech for the class, why does she not say, \"Do your worst, if you really think I don't want that to go viral; I will admit nothing, and not do your bidding.\" Instead Casey anonymously rats the girl out--falsely--for taking drugs, resulting in her expulsion. Naturally the girl attacks Casey in her yard at home--whereupon Casey cracks the girl's skull with a baseball bat.\r\n\r\nSelf-defense, right? Wrong. Evidently Casey does not want the police to investigate too closely--something about the true cause of the original fire. So she and a neighbor boy _bury the girl in a local park._\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the girl with the broken leg now tells Casey's well-meaning friend that she has \"created a monster.\" And everything comes to a head when Casey wins the \"Most Inspiring Student\" award. Here is the Big Reveal: _Casey started the original fire._ She had gone to counseling for \"anger issues,\" and the counselor received a police report casting suspicion on Casey. Why did she burn her own house down? Because her father had been abusing her and her mother both. But the neighbor boy confessed to starting the fire out of carelessness. Investigation dropped.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the friend brings Casey down at her moment of triumph, because she recorded Casey's confession without Casey knowing about it. And the slight that the cellphone thief had complained about? Turned out to be a real and serious injury--of what kind, the narrative never explains.\r\n\r\nThe plot holes should be obvious to anyone, even ignoring how the video of the confession could be that good while Casey is knocking out the girl making it, and tying her to a chair. Why didn't the counselor figure out that child abuse was going on? Why didn't Casey's mother say anything to the police? Why were the arson squad so quick to believe that other boy's confession? Are arson investigators really that sloppy?\r\n\r\nWhy did the two cheerleaders decide to take matters into their own hands? If they thought someone ought to look a little more closely into Casey's role in the fire, why didn't they speak up before Casey returned to school? And if someone has done you dirty, you don't pull a stupid stunt like dunking her wig in the toilet. That makes you just as bad as she is.\r\n\r\nOf course, the girl who broke her leg couldn't admit to robbing Casey of her cellphone before the incident. But who failed to check the girl's locker and verify that, broken lock or no, nothing was missing? Why did the other girl, facing expulsion, not lay her beef before her attorney? Are we to believe she never got one?\r\n\r\nAnd Casey burying the girl was the most stupid thing she did in the whole movie. The neighbor boy told her: self-defense! He could testify! (In fact the other girl had both hands around Casey's throat when Casey grabbed the bat she had brought, to investigate a noise, and whacked the girl upside the head with it.) She had so smoothly dealt with the initial suspicions after the leg-break incident. Now suddenly she is burying a body in a park? That's nothing but a boatload of fertilizer.\r\n\r\nBut the most stunning idea in this whole film is that it placed _bullies in the right._ That is something one should never do. Furthermore, it suggests that bullies serve a vital function for community protection and social-order maintenance. When they do that, they destroy any moral authority anyone has to bring the target of the bullying to book. One vital fact stands out: never, until the very end, did Casey strike out at an innocent person. And even at the end, she didn't kill the one who had befriended her.\r\n\r\nThe film ends, as most Lifetime/Reel One/Mar Vista/et al. films tend to do, with Casey in the reformatory, accepting a roommate. If that reformatory suddenly sees the emergence of an all-girl vigilance committee among the inmates, the authorities will have none to blame but themselves. And if this film causes someone to imitate Casey, the filmmakers will have none to blame but _them_selves for _that._"

It all centres around the intrigues and plotting over the succession to the Chozha throne in 10th century India. It transpires that the current emperor \"Sundara\" (Prakash Raj) came to the throne because the rightful successor was too young. Many years on, this ageing gent has nominated his own son \"Karikalan\" (Vikram) to succeed him, but there are growing murmurings amongst his nobility that the succession ought revert back to the original line. The Prince's confidente, \"Vandiyadevan\" (Karthi), is charged by the prince to garner as much intelligence as he can and deliver it to his Imperial father - a rather dangerous and perilous mission as he finds himself constantly (and energetically) jumping from frying pan to fire, unsure who to trust. What now ensues is really well paced and enjoyable. It mixed the fun elements of films like 'Prince of Persia\" (2010) with then grand scale battle scenarios of something like \"Marrakar\" (2021) with an host of glamorous and exquisitely dressed characters to keep the pot well and truly boiling. Aishwarya (\"Nandini\") and Trisha Krishnan (\"Kundavai\") also prove that the men folks are, frequently, being cleverly manipulated by their shrewd and intelligent spouses. I can't say the musical numbers always worked though. At their best, the expertly choreographed performances served the story well - illustrating just how important celebration was in convincing the populace that all was well. At times, though, they are a bit extended and can serve to disrupt the pace of this otherwise quite intricately constructed exercise in court-craft, betraya and seduction that has quite a bit of humour too. Stylish and glorious to look at (even if the visual effects are not always the best), this is entertaining and at just shy of three hours, it flew by remarkably quickly. It's also the first time in a long time that I've heard a cinema audience cheer the stars as they charismatically own the screen.

We love our life style and each other. Apparently, Hang Sang-Soo and Kim Min-Hee have such a relationship.\r\n\r\nRather, I think the film is a comment on the drama that many people cannot seem to escape. It is the so-called Law of Attraction, is it not? My wife and I have friends who live in this world of drama and we tire of listening to their stories of the same drama again and again.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the film may be just this comment. \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting a different result.\" (Incorrectly attributed to Einstein.) Kim Min-Hee views others' drama through the lens of her life, depicted in the film as watching others through a cinematic screen. She finds the peacefulness in being alone with her filmmaker.

Even the terror of running into your ex-girlfriend and current sugar daddy at a shiva.\r\n\r\nThat’s the general plot of Emma Seligman’s impressive debut, _Shiva Baby_. The movie begins with college senior Danielle (Rachel Sennott) waking up in her sugar daddy Max’s (Danny Deferrari) apartment. She’s running late to a shiva (we don’t ever find out who died) where she meets her parents (Fred Melamed and Polly Draper). Among the other guests are her ex-girlfriend Maya (Molly Gordon), Max, Max’s wife (Dianna Agron), and their infant child. Danielle sees all of these people in the same room, and her anxiety skyrockets. The movie takes place over the course of about two fictional hours, and the action occurs almost entirely in one home. It is a brisk 78 minutes, and that’s a perfect runtime. Another moment of this familial, heart-racing anxiety would have been too much for the audience to handle."

        "content": "I Used to Go Here is an alleged comedy about a hack who admits that “I'm not good enough to write a good book so I wrote a sh*tty book.” Not only has this premise been lifted from a Family Guy episode, but the movie's sense of humor is half-assed at best (but what can you expect from producers Andy Samberg, Jorma Tacone, and Akiva Schaffer?).\r\n\r\nFor example, there is a character named Bradley Cooper. That's it. That's the joke. What scriptwriter/director Kris Rey fails to see is that it's not enough to name a character after celebrity; you have to actually do something, go somewhere with it (I'm reminded of the 'Michael Bolton' character in Office Space). What's the point of naming the character Bradley Cooper if no one is ever even going to acknowledge it? You keep waiting for the other shoe to drop, and when it never does, it becomes nothing more than an annoying distraction.\r\n\r\nFollowing the release of her new book, novelist Kate Conklin (Gillian Jacobs) receives an invitation from her former college professor, David Kirkpatrick (Jemaine Clement), to speak at her alma mater, the fictional Illinois University.\r\n\r\nHer novel is called Seasons Passed, and from its cover and what little we hear of it, it wouldn't be out of place in the Nicholas Sparks canon; that is to say, it's the kind of book that gets its author invited to Oprah, not to a higher learning institution.\r\n\r\nKate accepts the invitation, and “rediscovers her college, but now through the eyes of the students living there” (All Movie), in whose lives she “finds herself deeply enmeshed” (IMDb). Actually, what Kate \"rediscovers\" doesn't go much farther than the house where she herself lived as a student, and where she spends most of her stay; meanwhile, the current tenants drop everything (even intercourse, because what kind of college students would have sex when they could get involved in the depressing problems of a 35-year-old instead? The same kind of college students who are never seen attending any classes) to be at her beck and call.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Kate hijacks this group of supposed college students, spends a night with one of them, and then leaves without learning from or teaching them anything; she even turns down a teaching position at the university, though it's not clear what exactly would qualify her for that position in the first place."

I don’t think it’s hyperbole to call the first 10 minutes a blood orgy – I mean, a waterfall ends up literally flowing red with the blood of the dead. This is all great stuff, brutal and uncompromising. Unfortunately, it’s also the best part of the film, after which it doesn’t take long for things to go downhill.\r\n\r\nThe plot goes in autopilot, following a very familiar path – and, as they say, familiarity breeds contempt. For starters, we have all the usual suspects; Liu Kang (Jordan Rodrigues), Sonya Blade (Jennifer Carpenter), and Johnny Cage (Joel McHale). The latter is the designated comedic character, at which he fails miserably – though the only laugh to be had here does have a little to do with him (or, rather, with a poster for one of his fictional films).\r\n\r\nOnce the inevitable Tournament begins, the movie gives up completely and becomes an animated remake of the 1995 Mortal Kombat – and, I guess, an animated prequel or something to the 2021 version. Scorpion's Revenge is without a doubt the best looking of the three films; it’s also the closest to the game, and while that’s good in terms of gore, it’s not so good in terms of storyline.\r\n\r\nIt’s just one fight after another, with little to distinguish each from the one before or the one after, and the characters are just as one-dimensional as their video game counterparts: Sonya is constantly trying to prove herself as good or better than the men, Cage is a buffoon who persists beyond the limits of reason in believing that the MK Tournament is his latest movie, and Liu Kang's dialogue consists almost entirely of Buddhist pseudo-koans. Furthermore, the script has a plothole so big a giant stalagmite could pass through it – and literally does."

Enter the handsome \"Maicon\" (Rafael Teóphilo) clad in leather astride a Harley Davidson (?) and both men have a new fantasy. There is plenty of fairly graphic sex - (though nothing compared to any French equivalent) and in a post-AIDS environment, these older guys seem to have little concern for their own, or each other's wellbeing - but it isn't just about casual sex. There is something more visceral about it - once the physical lusts have been sated, a semblance of a love story emerges and at times that is quite touching. It's quite a slow burn, but it isn't boring - give it a chance and it shows a side of gay storytelling devoid of the usual vacuous pretty boys in thongs and the ending is anything but straightforward."

It presents a sequence of events that is perhaps helpeful to those who only became aware of the bumps in the story, the times it hit the headlines. It seems it focuses less on Barrymore and a bit more on the victim, Stuart Lubbock. \r\n\r\nAs an American, the story rather naturally reminds me of the JonBenet Ramsey case, where the crime scene investigation was also bungled by the police first on the scene. And the small circle of party guests are either innocently telling the unhelpful truth, or else one or more are sticking to their lie like glue. And in both cases, wealthy persons are suspects (though the Ramseys weren’t full on celebrities until the unwanted attention after JonBenet’s murder). And neither case is ever solved. The rich are in fact different and the justice system reflects that. (I am not inferring that Barrymore is guilty, just that, except for the tabloid maelstrom, his money shielded him in ways that wouldn’t be open to you or me.)\r\n\r\n I have watched a lot of British tv, but not game shows or other programs with presenters, so Barrymore was unknown to me, and therefore this story was of little interest to me. It was just good enough for me to keep it on, letting it wash over me as I did something else. It will be of more interest to British viewers, I assume. But it is well made, I can say that much. Perhaps the most revealing part to me is when the victim’s father spends an hour with Barrymore, years after the fact, and admits they were lost in chatter and laughter, small talk, he calls it. They barely touched upon the death of his son. He was played, he said, by Barrymore. But really he was played by the colt of celebrity and fame."

Sure, I’m with you.\r\n\r\nIt is tempting to state that the goal of the scientists in this show is to take a picture of a black hole. But of course to them the journey is nearly more important than the result. So much has been learned in the 20 years plus they have pursued this, not merely about black holes but about how the universe works. Again, however, it is hard for me to appreciate all of it because it is all theoretical and seems to have nothing to do with the lives we live on this blue speckled planet.\r\n\r\nSo at times the information is fascinating, while at other times you are rolling your eyes and thinking, “Come back people, say something I can understand.

Before he knows it, his placid existence is being disturbed by increasingly popular - and disturbing - rumours that the French are to restart nuclear weapons testing nearby. Of course he is assured not, and makes similar assurances to the population himself, but when local girls start to go missing the presence of the military and a general sentiment amongst the locals seems to encourage a view that it's time to assert their own independence. This creates more problems that begin to cause our diplomatic quite an headache. Can he sort it all out? Is there even anything to sort out? The thing with this film is that it is far, far too long. The story could easily lose an hour and no harm would be done. The plot, political mischief and island intrigues, would benefit from that tightening up too - perhaps sparing us from the many shots of his car! Magimel delivers an efficient characterisation here, but he is largely left to his own devices as the supporting cast struggle to build upon a rather thin storyline that needed a bit more shoring up to sustain the interest as it rambled on.

Aline Brosh McKenna manages to elevate the genre's narrative formulas with her personal, intelligent storytelling, offering an unusual point of view for the emotional growth between two protagonists separated for practically the entire runtime. Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher deliver good performances, along with the rest of the amusing cast, taking advantage of the long takes to flex their acting muscles. Predictable and lacking memorable messages, but I couldn't recommend it more for fans of the genre.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-"

Aside from Affleck, I didn't care for any of the other performances and therefore any of the other characters.\r\n\r\nIt's not even a bad film, it's just so, so boring - for me, anyway."

        "content": "It's not often I find myself writing this, but Ben Affleck is comfortably the best thing about this otherwise rather lacklustre adaptation of JR Moehringer's autobiographical coming of age tale. It depicts the story of his childhood - through the eyes of the engaging young Daniel Ranieri - before he heads to Yale in the guise of Tye Sheridan. The first half hour, maybe, is quite entertaining. This young lad living with his mother (his selfish father is estranged from them, living the mobile life of a late night radio talk show host) in the home of his mildly eccentric grandfather (Christopher Lloyd) and their home is a lively, buzzing environment in which the youngster thrives. Chief amongst the residents is his charismatic, worldly-wise uncle \"Charlie\" (Affleck) who runs a local bar populated with a decent, working-class clientele who take to the young man and encourage his obvious academic talents. That half hour peters out, though, and the rest of the film is really a rather uninspiring story of a young man, his \"first love\", a youth who is looking for some sort of positive male \"role model\". I find Sheridan a rather sterile actor. Sure, he is pretty, but he doesn't ever stand out with his performances. They are all just a little bit by the numbers, and here is no different. He speak words of passion, but his acting conveys none of that adequately on screen. The soundtrack is left to do much of the heavy lifting when it comes to dialogue, and it feels longer than the 1¾ hours it takes to watch. I am glad I watched it - on a big screen in London with just one other person - but I don't think I would ever bother watching it again."

        "content": "This film, written by William Monahan and directed by George Clooney on autopilot is yet another shallow glimpse into the formative years of an wannabe writer. This is hardly virgin territory, having already been thoroughly covered by the likes of Unstrung Heroes, Almost Famous, and Neil Simon’s ‘Eugene Trilogy’, to mention but a few examples.\r\n\r\nJ.R. Maguire (Daniel Ranieri, Tye Sheridan), based on American novelist and journalist J. R. Moehringer, grows up in an eccentric family straight from Central Casting — we have the long-suffering single mother, the deadbeat dad, the curmudgeonly grandfather with a secret heart of gold, and the cool uncle who doubles as a father figure. The only thing, and it’s nothing to sneeze at, that The Tender Bar has going for it is that the grandfather and uncle are played by Christopher Lloyd Ben Affleck.\r\n\r\n“When you’re 11, you want an Uncle Charlie,” says J.R. I can’t disagree, especially considering that Uncle Charlie owns The Dickens Bar, its shelves filled with booze and books. Now, this and no other is the movie they should have made: one wherein Ben Affleck is a self-taught philosopher barman who doles out drinks and folk wisdom in equal parts, and Christopher Lloyd is his best customer.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately what we have here is such hackneyed material that Affleck’s and Lloyd’s combined efforts can hardly raise it above the commonplace (how’s this for a cliché: to illustrate the fickleness of J.R.’S stereotypically unattainable romantic interest, the soundtrack breaks into into Paul Simon’s “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover”), whence it crumbles back whenever they’re off-screen.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t help either that the potential shown by Sheridan in Mud and Joe apparently didn’t survive the actor’s puberty. In these two films Sheridan could boast of going toe-to-toe with Matthew McConaughey and Nic Cage; here Affleck acts circles around him.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, we hear from a number of people how good a writer J.R. is, but we’re never given any concrete reason for that — only platitudes, such as invoking some ineffable je ne sais quoi or just unilaterally deciding that “You are a writer the moment you say you are.” What he fails to realize is that talking business and meaning business are two very different things."

The plot is compelling and features a lot of heart, it certainly uses the usual Disney/sports biopic beats but there's a lot of goodness in there as well. On this note, it has a decision scene where I half expected Chuck Norris to appear. Iykyk.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the cast. Jay Reeves gives a terrific performance as Ray, while Thaddeus J.

U.N. officers and the blue helmets had the duty to protect the population and prevent the invasion. Aida is an interpreter working for the U.N., helping during the negotiation between the Bosnians and the blue helmets. While the time quickly passes, colonel Karremans doesn’t receive any updates or support from the U.N., NATO, or the Dutch government. The situation is dangerous. Thousands of people gathered near the U.N. compound seeking help. But they are too many, the blue helmets struggle to keep control, and general Mladic is ready to enter the city."

While the body count is lower than I like in a shark film, the director does a great job of having the shark attack and terrify characters in more ways than just getting drug under. The kills that do happen are more intense because The Reef: Stalked shows the shark attacking rather than saving money on the victims just disappearing. While some of the acting isn’t incredible, and there are the typical clumsily falling into the water moments throughout, the characters make some smart decisions and fight back rather than just getting picked off one by one. I enjoyed The Reef: Stalked much more than its predecessor (thankfully, you can see this one without seeing the first one). It's nowhere near as good as The Shallows, but it’s a decent movie if you're a shark movie fan."

It turns out that \"Terrance\" (Aaron Pierre) has come from the supra-governmental agency that's in charge of populating space - yep, the planet is on it's last legs - and that \"Junior\" has been selected to go live upstairs leaving is wife behind. No chance says \"Junior\", no choice says \"Terrance\" but there is some silver lining for \"Hen\". They will make her a carbon copy of her husband to \"keep her company\" whilst he is away. To that end, their visitor must remain for a few weeks to gather information on every intimate detail of their lives together so that \"Junior 2\" can be as authentic as possible. Now we don't actually know this, but it's safe to assume that somewhere in the ensuing proceedings, there is a body swap otherwise the rather dreary and drawn out denouement would make even less sense that it actually does. Is this suppose to be a crit on the nature of human relationships, or of the human psyche? If you went to bed at night and awoke to an identical partner that had been swapped in the night, would you even know? That's the problem. It's a complete non-story that limbers towards it's conclusion without really engaging on any level. That said, man-of-the-moment Mescal does turn in an emotional performance at times, but Ronan is really rather wasted here and the thinly developed characterisation of \"Terrance\" just further consigns this to the doldrums of what looks a short story laggardly dragged out for all but two hours. It's a slow and rather listless film for the most part and contains nothing new. Disappointing."

The script is good enough not just to make these two characters overly simple.\r\n\r\nMcKay finds himself again being a messenger right back in the wars (after after he starred in 1917) with the world being on the verge of WWII. He just must be made of the right stuff - or at least the running stuff.\r\nIrons thrives as the miscalculating Chamberlain PM, while the film shows him to be harshly treated by history. Everyone seems anxious as if there was a war on or something.\r\n\r\nThe theme of personal need versus national duty comes up as well as the sacrifices required come in opposite directions when some are sacrificing for the country and others are against it. The film serves as inspiration and a warning for future skirmishes. \r\n\r\nViewers can be glad the filmmakers resisted the temptation of calling this Hitler’s Translator. It’s an effective international thriller since the audience know the ending and its accompanying tragedy."

However, the director embraces the fictional way more than the historical one, and the film becomes an enjoyable drama enriched with some taste of a thriller. **- The Story -** In autumn 1938, Europe was on the brink of war. Hitler claimed back the territory of Sudetenland, belonging at that moment to Czechoslovakia. If Hitler invades the Czech, France and Britain must protect them. Prime Minister Chamberlain and his staff have less than 24 hours to find a diplomatic solution and prevent a tragic European conflict. Behind the lines, two old friends, Hugh Legat and Paul von Hartmann weave the web to keep the peace and change the course of history. The solution seems to be a quick agreement to give back to the Germans the Sudetenland. But will it be enough? Who are Hugh and Paul? And what is behind this story and the conspiracy? - **Full analysis at https://www.spotamovie.com/munich-the-edge-of-war-movie-review-and-explanation-2021-movie/**"

Likewise, the young \"Adri\" (Luana Giuliani) looks a bit like Cruz too - who plays her mother \"Clara\". The story is set in a Roman 1970s of floral patterns and bell-bottomed trousers, post-war development and centres around the young daughter who really wants to be a boy. This isn't an in-your-face drama about sexuality, it's more nuanced than that and whilst the underlying frustrations of \"Adri/Andrew\" serves as a spine for the film, there is also a relationship between husband and wife, a broader familial one and the hint of a slightly undercooked romance between \"Adri\" and her new, less privileged, friend \"Sara\" (Penélope Nieto Conti). It's that last relationship that rather sums us the pretty bitty narrative here. We see snippets of their lives, but they are not necessarily that well connected to the theme. It's episodic without enough explanation. The marriage is failing, yes. Why? Well that we don't really know. The father/husband \"Felice\" (Vincenzo Amato) role is left hanging all to often, we have no idea what makes him tick nor, really, do we get to grips with what is troubling the loving and caring \"Clara\". Their son \"Gino\" (Patrizio Francioni) has a rather curious habit of leaving little deposits on the carpet and, indeed, it's really only the young \"Diana\" (María Chiara Goretti) who brings any sanity to this family arrangement. There is humour here, permitting us to take a breather from the frequently over-intense writing and there are a few musical numbers that showcase both Cruz and Giuliani as talented and skilful at their craft. It's worth a watch, and it looks stylish and classy, but I'm afraid I found it all just a bit too messy and superficial."

It seems that he might be reconciled with his sibling - but for that he has to follow the elephant, and there hasn't been one in his town for an age.

The three impossible tasks are quite entertaining, as is the whole film. The story is all a little predictable and it does stray into sentimentality just a bit too often, but it's an engaging family drama with some fun characters and colourful scenarios.

Then the latter heads to the gate to meet \"Cadi\" (Annes Elwy), a local girl seconded by his mother to help out at a dinner party she is hosting. It seems this family made a killing selling mineral licences to a company run by the rather odious \"Euros\" (Rhodri Meilir) and the purpose of the lavish dinner is to convince their neighbour \"Mair\" (Lisa Palfrey) to allow the same on her property. The blade falls off the axe \"Guto\" is using to chop wood - injuring his foot, and that is just the first in an increasingly bizarre series of mishaps that befall the ensemble, and pretty quickly we discover that \"Cadi\" (who has virtually no dialogue) is not quite what she seems... What now ensues is a \"feast\" that would put you off food for the rest of your life. It's quite gory and the visual effects are actually quite good for what must have been a modestly funded exercise. Thing is, the acting is not really that great and once the penny has dropped the plot becomes rather clumsily allegorical. Mixing mythology with \"planet pillaging\" and elements of the seven deadly sins to provide for an ending that is all rather messy - in just about every sense. It's a film for television that might work OK on a dark wintry evening."

The inconsistencies are glaring. \r\n\r\nThe most obvious is steering this tale away from its focus on the male leads, in favour of not necessarily peripheral but definitely secondary or tertiary, female characters. Yes, in my opinion, its yet another clumsy chance to hoist the flag of feminism. Making female characters relevant to the story, in the modern woke context. Of course, this predictably, unbalances the story. The musketeers, are, nudged into the background, in the own tale. \r\n\r\nThe second point of failure is the age of D'Artagnan, who in past films is typically played by a young male actor because this tale, in a sense, is a coming of age story. That's all swept aside too, quite possibly in service to the feminisation of the story.Instead, he's portrayed by a 33 year old man, incongruously called, \"a boy\". Suffice to say, it all feels rather awkward.\r\n\r\nAre there any redeeming elements to the production? Obviously, the acting is sound, its a strong cast. Money has been spent on sets, settings, fight choreography and more, to try to bring this period in French history, to life.\r\n\r\nRegrettably, so much else is wrong that this film simply feels \"openly fake\", to this reviewer. I do not see it as a loyal expression, of Dumas sterling work. Nor the period, in which it is set.\r\n\r\nIn summary,feminises an essentially masculine tale. Don't believe me, just look at the poster, not to mention the film itself. In my view  there are numerous superior and more accurate, cinematic expressions of Dumas work, on offer."

As the title may suggest, this young man has some mental health issues that his peers have enjoyed ridiculing over the years and that his parents Judy Davis and Anthony LaPaglia have spent some time trying to manage - and that's not been an easy task. He wants to learn to surf, but to buy a board he needs cash so starts his own lawn-cutting enterprise. He asks an eccentric, but wealthy, local woman \"Helen\" (Essie Davis) if he can cut her lawn but his mower breaks down so she asks him to walk her dogs instead. The pair start to bond over some Gilbert & Sullivan, and after a row with his long suffering mother he moves in and the pair plan a trip to Los Angeles together. Tragedy strikes before they can go, and he finds himself inheriting her wealth. This benefaction comes too late to stop another family tragedy but it does enable him to fund an unhealthy obsession with (very easily obtained) semi-automatic guns! Judy Davis offers a fine and nuanced performance here as his truly conflicted mother and Essie Davis is also really quite effective as his dog-loving friend who accepts him unreservedly. The film is presented as if these seemingly unrelated scenarios were a sequence of precariously stacked dominoes. Once one tumbles, there is an inevitability that \"Nitram\" will lose what little grasp he has and resort to something shocking - though perhaps not quite this! It is not a cheery film, indeed it is quite depressing to watch for much of the latter stages once hope has been well and truly extinguished from the young man's life; but it is most certainly worth watching if you are in the mood for something challenging."

Pugh never does anything half-heartedly, and she doesn't here either - but the story is weak and, for me, all just a little over-dramatic. The rather retrospective style of story telling leaves way too many gaps and the crises seem just a bit too contrived to be convincing. \"Alison\" is easily the most interesting of the characters, but she is also easily the most irritating, selfish and I found the lack of substance to the plot just made it harder to be sympathetic to her (or, for that matter, to \"Daniel\" or \"Nathan\"). It tries to deal with some serious and heart-rending topics, but Zach Braff seems content with offering a strongly performed but superficially presented, overly simplistic, melodrama here that I thought rather wasted the talent at his disposal. There are also far too many dreary guitar ballads that seems to step up where the writers suffer from a dearth of ideas. It's watchable, but not great."

Is it real; was it deliberately faked; is it an overly restored work by his student, or of one of their students or by Dianne Modestini?

        "content": "_This review was written by S/W Curator Ivan Kander:_\r\n\r\nCrafting a “simple” short is harder than it looks. All the typical low budget indie ingredients—a single location, a handful of actors, a dialogue-driven narrative—need to be utilized in just the right way in order to make something where the scrappy simplicity doesn’t undermine the entertainment or emotional impact. It’s, ultimately, the perfect creative challenge: sometimes limitations can yield the best results.\r\n\r\nTogether is the third film I’ve screened over the past few months from director Brett Cramer starring actor Meg Cashel. All serve as proof that this creative duo has just sort of “figured it out” when it comes to crafting smart, small-scale low budget short-shorts. They present immediately engaging, character-driven premises that quickly spiral out of control, leaning into comedy but always finding a way back to emotional resonance.\r\n\r\nPartially the success here hinges purely on Cashel (who is also a co-writer on this project). She’s terrific and just incredibly good at handling neurotic comedic escalation—a sort of nervous rambling that starts small and quickly manages to touch upon deeper things as the words keep flowing. She goes big but never bombastic, and so, there is always a relatable vulnerability even when things are at their most awkward and comedic.\r\n\r\nCramer also deserves a lot of credit for steering the ship. It’s a visually simple film, yes, but as he mentions in his No Film School article for previous S/W pick It’s Been Awhile, he puts a lot of thought into the craft of these projects, figuring out ways to use simple tools for peak efficacy. This comes down to smart lens choices and strong compositions, as well as a clear focus on pacing and timing in the edit. For a film that is literally just three people sitting in one place, it never feels boring, and that in and of itself, is an accomplishment.\r\n\r\nBeyond technical execution, for Together specifically, I like how the film uses the underlying comedic premise (a couple feigning piety in order to get “permission” to get married in a Catholic Church) to touch upon broader ideas about trust and belief in a relationship. As a Jew who married a Jew, I had it easy in this regard: my wife and I had a Jewish wedding and everyone’s bubbe was happy.\r\n\r\nThis gets more complicated in “mixed belief” relationships and starts to probe at the actual importance of faith in one’s life. Is one religious for the optics of it? How much of what we do…how many choices are made…simply to avoid confrontation? Across its six minutes, Together probes a variety of things (my favorite tangent being about sexual agency and a woman’s control of her own body in relationship with Catholic dogma). Ultimately, though, the film is about people close to one another not actually talking with each other—that living with the aim to please someone else can, ultimately, metastasize into something malignant.\r\n\r\nAs Cramer relates to Short of the Week:\r\n\r\n“I’m interested in the lengths some people will go to satisfy their partners –– even at the expense of their own happiness –– and how those well-intentioned choices can snowball into something damaging if left unchecked…We were hoping to achieve a truthful and nuanced snapshot of a rushed relationship, where failure stems mostly from good intentions instead of spite or toxicity.\" \r\n\r\nI mentioned it in my feature of It’s Been Awhile, but it’s worth noting again: I like how Cramer has been making shorts in quarantine without explicitly making “quarantine” shorts (he has more in the works). Again, this goes back to utilizing simple resources to peak efficacy in respect of the limitations of shooting during a global pandemic (Together was shot with just 6 cast and crew members), but it also shines a light on how uninteresting I have found most “pandemic films.”\r\n\r\nI could give a lick about dumb jokes focused on mask-wearing and Zoom calls: it’s my life right now, I don’t want to be reminded of it in the entertainment I watch. Moreover, I think making a film specifically about Coronavirus sort of limits its eventual efficacy. After all, there will be a time when we can take our masks off and go into the world again. So, it seems smart to be telling human relationship stories that will stay resonate long after “social distancing” becomes a choice, not a public health requirement."

        "content": "_This excerpt is from a review written by Omeleto curator Allen Tsai:_\r\n\r\nDirected by Brett Cramer from a script co-written with actor Meg Cashel, this dramedy is sharply witty and deeply serious in its portrayal of a couple navigating the line between keeping the peace and keeping one’s integrity. The film has a perceptive thoughtfulness on all levels, balancing both the humor of an awkward situation with the doubts and uncertainties it ultimately reveals.\r\n\r\nThe short is essentially a long scene that leans on dialogue to move its story forward, and the visuals keep the focus on the couple’s unspoken thoughts and emotions. The moody, burnished cinematography plays against the sometimes antic pace of the dialogue, and though there is little camera movement, the editing and shot composition make sure the audience never misses a micro-reaction or fleeting thought from the couple. Visually, the film is a master class in how the simplest elements of cinematic art can yield terrific storytelling when leveraged with great thought, clarity and intention.\r\n\r\nBut the strength of the film is its precise writing and excellent performances. There’s great humor in how Anna and Tom dance around the truth in their desire to win over the priest, as well as how the archaic beliefs of some religions don’t reflect modern relationships. Actor Meg Cashel nails the perfect balance between comic neuroticism and sharply critical thought, asking provocative questions not just about religious dogma, but about how to balance individual truth with the larger partnership. As the situation escalates, Anna can’t help but explode in a torrent of thought — one that reveals the deeper, thornier truths between the couple.\r\n\r\nBoth warmly empathetic and accessibly cerebral, “Together” is quietly thought-provoking, using its humor to examine not just the role of religious faith in modern life, but also how silencing our voices to make a partner happy can open up great fissures of division. Just like how the film’s seemingly modest scale belies its precise craftsmanship, a simple pared-down scene becomes a tour-de-force of great insight and deep melancholy, when deep truths come out and fates of people shift in a new direction, forming the emotional earthquakes that make up the plot twists of ordinary life."

        "content": "Breaking Boundaries: The Science of Our Planet understands that it’s not the planet, but the human race that must be saved, and the only way to do that is to study how the planet works (know your enemy, perhaps?).\r\n\r\nAs Swedish professor Johan Rockström says, “biodiversity is not something we need to protect due to some kind of moral responsibility of one species, humans, towards another species such as flora and fauna”, but because “it is the toolbox for the functioning of our societies.”\r\n\r\nRockström is a proponent of Planetary Boundaries, a conceptual framework that assesses the state of nine processes fundamental to the stability of the Earth system, and suggests a series of thresholds for these processes that, if overcome, can endanger the habitability of the planet.\r\n\r\nThese thresholds are one-way doors; once crossed, there is no going back. Greenland, for example, is apparently fubar, as are half the corals in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.\r\n\r\nRockström is Swedish, and that’s the only thing he has in common with Greta Thunberg. While she is a shrill, sanctimonious, self-righteous, malnourished bitch on wheels, Rockström is calm, cool and collected (by the way, the documentary is hosted by David Attenborough, a paragon of avuncular bonhomie); furthermore, Rockström actually sounds like he knows what he’s talking about, and is much easier to take seriously.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Rockström demonstrates a deep understanding of human nature; accordingly, he cuts to the chase and appeals to people’s selfishness as a catalyst for change. And why not? He’s aware that the average a--hole never listens to the science anyway."

I found it a tiny bit more watchable than its predecessor.\r\n\r\n<em>'365 Days: This Day'</em> still has nothing that even closely resembles a plot, still has extremely limited actors and still shouldn't even exist. However, I'd be lying if I said I disliked it as much as the 2020 original. It's almost like taking out the sexual violence actually makes it more digestable, who'd a thunk it?!\r\n\r\nUnlike that other release, this falls into the more common category of just simply being rubbish. I will say, though, the music kinda slaps. The film is pretty much comprised of a series of sexual music videos placed back-to-back-to-back. Some of music used is well chosen I can't deny, I Shazam'd a couple... admittedly that probably says more about my taste in music than anything else!  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n\r\nThere's even some minor neat cinematography, too. The positives I note are minimal, though, and don't overly help this 2022 production. I have more negatives, which also include an overlong run time and that shoddy ending. At least it marginally improves upon the film it follows, I wonder if its own sequel will do likewise? I plan to find out!"

It's all based on a true story directed and adapted from his own story by Elegance Bratton, so jeopardy here there isn't. That said, Pope and Woodbine are both on good form as the former runs the gamut of a tough training regime coupled with a prejudice against his sexuality that proves distinctly dangerous. His trainer offers him nothing by way of support or sympathy, intent on instilling the most primitive of \"survival of the fittest\" mentalities amongst all of his recruits. It is a little procedural, but it's still an interesting tale from a man who resisted the temptations to jack it all in - and sends a clear message of perseverance and determination that does resonate to a certain, predictable, extent. Essentially, though, it's a television movie that doesn't really need a cinema screening and though watchable and important, it isn't a story that will linger in the memory for long afterwards, I'm afraid."

Kristjan Sokoli plays a yokel while Cliff Yates is on hand as the sheriff.  \r\n\r\n“Devil’s Island” (2021) is a slow-burn mystery Indie with a bit o’ suspense and horrific thrills, but it’s not a gory horror movie.

The curvy, petite protagonist is attractive and the paradisal locations are enjoyable with the movie playing almost like a travelogue, but viewers who need an explosion every 10 minutes or buckets of blood will likely find it mundane and tedious.\r\n\r\nThe flick respects the viewer’s intelligence to connect the dots based on the glaring clues without spelling it out. It’s simple as pie, but I don’t want to spoil it for viewers. The theme revolves around overcoming fear, using your intelligence & available resources in response to grave challenges and standing your ground.

It turns out to be from a colleague from the brewery in which he worked and it mentions that she is in an hospice, terminally ill with cancer. He pens the briefest of replies and sets off to post the letter. En route, he pops into the local garage for a pint of milk and encounters a young girl with blue hair (Nina Singh) who urges him not to lose hope. Her words have quite an effect. He decides to post his letter in the next post box, then the next. The next thing we know he in on a trek some 450-odd miles from their home in Devon to Berwick-upon-Tweed. That's about as far as he can actually walk without entering Scotland! Along the way he encounters some interesting characters whilst fighting a bit of a rear guard action with his bewildered wife at home (via the phone) and we are also, gradually, introduced to flashbacks illustrating the tragedy both went through with their own increasingly wayward son \"David\" (Earl Cave). This is a powerful tour-de-force from Broadbent. As the journey develops, his character exudes a gritty determination alongside an humanity that is touching and engaging. Dame Penelope really only features sparingly, almost like a steam valve to let us all take a breather from the intensity of the march - and that works to a certain extent, but unfortunately I found the substance of the story a bit lacking. It works better when it is just him, but as he meets and attracts hangers-on, then melodrama creeps in and increasingly diverts the theme into a rather disappointing vein of stereotype and hippiedom. There is also an implausible degree of serendipity to bits of this - as illustrated by his encounters with \"Martina\" (Monika Gossmann) and a cancer surgeon in a tea room. Still, I bet he hadn't met too many men who liked to lick their younger boyfriend's leaky trainers - and that, amongst other scenes, does inject a degree of humour (and an opportunity for this actor to use his hugely expressive face) to this travelogue with a difference. It felt long, not as long as his walk, but it could have maybe lost twenty minutes to keep it from meandering. There is some lovely, scenic, photography to enjoy which makes a cinema screening preferable, but it will do equally well on the telly. Characterful certainly but just a bit, well, plodding."

But either he couldn’t or wasn’t allowed to work similar magic here. \r\n\r\nThe characters don’t mumble exactly, but the overall effect to me is that they might as well have been. The dialogue isn’t exactly electric and they seem to deliver them rather matter of factly. When Marlow beats up a few guys and says, “I am getting too old for this,” it comes out sounding like the tired cliche it is rather than a heartfelt observation by a jaded private eye.\r\n\r\nSo I can’t help but label this as a missed opportunity; I mean, it’s Liam Neeson for goodness sake.

It is a good implementation. Liam Neeson, whom I generally like as an actor, is quite a good fit for the role of Philip Marlowe. Overall I quite enjoyed this movie.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the so called “critics” at Woke (Rotten) Tomatoes gave this movie 25% Rotten of course destroyed any credibility these woke hacks might have had left.

Tim Roth and Charlotte Gainsbourg give strong performances as the patriarch and matriarch of the family, respectively. The rest of the cast is also excellent. The film is slow-paced and gently suspenseful, with plenty of twists and turns to keep viewers guessing as to what is at the heart of the trouble in this family.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue in **SUNDOWN** is sharp and intelligent, with the characters often engaging in heated exchanges that reveal a lot about their relationships.

There are also some very funny moments, which help to lighten the mood in what is otherwise a tense film.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is beautiful, with the sun-drenched Acapulco setting providing a stunning backdrop for the film's events. The use of light and shadow is also excellent, creating an atmosphere of suspense and foreboding that adds to the film's overall impact.\r\n\r\nThemes such as family dynamics, secrets, and betrayal are explored in **SUNDOWN**, making it a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film.

He can't have had much money or time for anything here, but despite that he manages to film a certain effective eeriness to the scenarios. There is, however, nothing more to be said for this fanciful, slightly kinky, and really quite risible tale of usurpation. The acting is as bad as the writing - and that's saying something. Richard Rowden and Reece Connolly come across little better than easy on the eye drama school students and Tim Cartwright's attempt at portraying the megalomanic Richard III can be guaranteed to remind you of the original \"Blackadder\" series from forty years earlier. The myths about the princes in the tower are a great seam for film makers. This one? Well it's one that needs to be planted six feet under!"

This rapid-fire screwball comedy follows the exploits of four young Asian women (Ashley Park, Sherry Cola, Sabrina Wu, Stephanie Hsu) on an outlandish road trip through China that steadily deteriorates but routinely places them in a host of raucously hilarious, debauchery-riddled situations. In doing so, the film steadily serves up huge laughs in a story that’s accurately being billed as a release unlike anything that moviegoers have seen before. While it’s true that the narrative stretches credibility a bit at times and the film has its share of predictable and sweet but sappy moments, those minor faults are vastly overshadowed by its many strengths, including its fine ensemble cast, balanced pacing, and vibrant, colorful, superbly crafted production design. Because of the nature of the humor, however, sensitive viewers may want to skip this one (though it’s truly hard not to laugh, no matter how conservative one’s views might be). “Joy Ride” may not have received much fanfare or pre-release publicity, but it’s one of the funniest comedies to come along in quite some time, and it’s handily one of the best offerings of what has thus far been an otherwise-stunningly disappointing summer movie season. Indeed, get ready to seriously laugh your ass off with this one."

Rather stupidly, she agrees to take her rather unpredictable pal \"Lolo\" (Sherry Cola) and, well you can just guess how messy it all gets. For the most part this is quite a pithy and earthily written, end-to-end, comedy drama with some engaging performances from these two as well as from Stephanie Hsu's \"Kat\" - a soap star with a few secrets to keep - and the occasionally scene-stealing \"Dead Eye\" (Sabrina Wu) who has many of the best lines as the story unfolds and the adopted \"Audrey\" seeks out her birth mother. It's the latter stages of the film that rather let this down. It can't resist a wallow in cheesy sentiment and the pace drops off a cliff for the last twenty minutes which is a shame. Still, it's a genuinely entertaining film that puts four quite plausible friends through drinking games, plenty of adult fun and games - with an entire basketball team; and makes some decent attempts at characterisation.

This diverse, explicit, sex-positive movie is going to make a lot of people (especially misogynistic-leaning men), very, very uncomfortable, and audiences should be there for every delicious second of it. Perhaps a better title for the film would’ve been “Crazy Horny Asians.”\r\n\r\nA once-in-a-lifetime international adventure is at hand for four Asian-American friends when they find themselves traveling across China in search of one of their birth mothers. There’s the straight-laced Audrey (Ashley Park), a career-minded legal associate on an important business trip who has stretched the truth to her boss that she is fluent in Mandarin. Needing a translator, she enlists the aid of her foul-mouthed, free spirited, irreverent bestie, Lolo (Sherry Cola), to tag along. They’ve always been an odd couple since they first met on the playground as kids, and their friendship is as strong as ever.\r\n\r\nThe group grows even larger when Lolo decides to pay a visit to her former college roommate turned popular Chinese soap star Kat (Stephanie Hsu) as well as her eccentric cousin, Deadeye (Sabrina Wu). These women couldn’t be more different, but their epic adventure becomes a bonding journey like no other.\r\n\r\nThe cast is terrific and they work well together. Each woman brings something unique to the table, and they are a delight to spend time with. Each character has something viewers can identify with, no matter how outlandish the situations get. The screenplay was written by three women (Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, Teresa Hsiao, and Lim), and their knack for finding the perfect balance between humor and sincerity sets the tone for the entire film. This is a female-forward project both in front of and behind the camera.\r\n\r\nThe film depicts diverse representation in a natural but refreshing and modern way. It’s not often you get to see women having fun, being bawdy, and participating in (and most of the time, instigating) all forms of debauchery. These friends are sex-obsessed and body-positive, and they aren’t held back by shame or societal standards. This translates to a film that contains explicit sexual content and language, so prudes should steer clear.\r\n\r\nWhile the comedy is mostly hit or miss, the core of the story feels highly personal and heartfelt. There’s an unexpected warmth that’s buried beneath all the saucy bits, but it’s so strong that it emerges as the real star of the narrative. There are several touching moments and discussions about identity and culture, and the message about friendship and family feels universal.\r\n\r\n“Joy Ride” doesn’t invent the classic road trip movie, but it does showcase a contemporary and progressive spin that should be welcomed by moviegoers."

The latter becomes a major contender for awards even beyond the festival, offering an unforgettable, mesmerizing, haunting display of a traumatized mother.\r\n\r\nFrom a hypnotizing, uninterrupted 10-minute monologue to nerve-wracking interactions with an also remarkably creepy Tim Roth, Andrew Semans puts the actress through shocking, disturbing plot points and emotionally devastating character development. The lingering cinematography and powerfully effective sound design exponentially increase the suspense and intensity levels.\r\n\r\nA divisive, multiple-interpretation ending may divide some viewers, and a slight loss of momentum during the second act may reduce the climax impact, but these are minor issues in what will end up as one of the very best movies of the year.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A"

With it's opening, Steve Wynn thought it would be a good idea to shoot an hour long family adventure film that was actually just a promotional advertisement for his new Hotel. This movie would finally end up one night on NBC Sunday Night special late in January for one night only. But I also believe that the VHS was sold inside the Casino as well.\r\n\r\nThe movie showcases _\"The Battle of Buccaneer Bay\"_ along with other parts of the casino and Wynn's other property at the time, The Mirage. It also includes the Implosion of the Dunes Hotel & Casino, which was the day after the opening of the Treasure Island.\r\n\r\nThis movie is pure nostalgia for me. It's definitely not the best movie in the world, but every time I watch it, it brings me right back to the 90's. Plus the music in this is actually really good. As someone who used to go see this show fairly regularly as a kid and watching this movie it's hard not to give it five stars, just for the nostalgia. It would be the main reason why I also love other pirate themed movies such as; **Hook, Peter Pan, Muppet Treasure Island**, and et cetera.\r\n\r\nBy 2003, _\"The Battle of Buccaneer Bay\"_ was revamped for a more adult orientated audience as along with a name change of the Hotel. Now being called _\"The Sirens Cove\"_ and _\"The Sirens of T.I.\"_ Which somehow acquired the direction and choreography of Kenny Ortega. \r\n\r\nThen by 2013 the Sirens were booted out to make way for a Señor Frog's. So now there is no more shows except for the _Cirque du Soleil_ show, **Mystere**. Which was the first permanent Cirque show in Las Vegas so I guess that's cool, but it's sad the days of the free show in their front entrance is gone forever, Aaron Hernandez. \r\n\r\nWhich is why I always like to come back to this movie for a nice little dose of nostalagia."

        "content": "Over a relatively short period of time, over a dozen dead women are found bundled by the roadside - and the police are baffled? The women have not been sexually assaulted, but strangled using a knot tied in their headscarves. Not convinced that everything is being done by the authorities, investigative journalist \"Rahimi\" (Zar Amir-Ebrahimi) decides to get to the truth. Meantime, we follow the life of taxi driver \"Saeed\" (Mehdi Bajestani) and his daily life helps us to realise that the deceased were prostitutes. Not that he uses them, but pretty soon we realise that the stories are connected. At this point the plot rather falls away - we get to the bottom of the murder-mystery a little too simplistically for my liking; but actually as that plot develops we realise that the whodunit element of the narrative is not the most important one. It rapidly becomes an evaluation of a judicial process - and of vocal popular opinion - that may just indicate that these killings are in someway justifiable. These women, were - after all, sinful and irredeemable. Can the killer capitalise on this zealousness and escape justice? It's quite an intriguing film that looks at how religious faith can butt - head to head - with civic justice; of how the ordinarily law-abiding public themselves can; of how a person can genuinely believe he is doing good by removing \"stains\" from his community... I cannot believe anyone from the West would watch this with anything other than a feeling of abhorrence at the offences, but this film does attempt to put both sides in a thought-provoking fashion. Though it didn't change my opinion, it did offer a balance that makes the last twenty minutes or so a lot less fait accompli than we might expect. Bajestani is good here and this is more than just a good vs. evil crime drama. Well worth a watch. Telly will be fine, though."

        "content": "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\n“Holy Spider” is a disturbing crime thriller that’s based on the true story of the “Spider Killer” Saeed Hanaei, a man who murdered 16 female sex workers in Iran in the early 2000s. It’s a chilling tale of the intersection of religion, culture, social status, and sexism, and despite director Ali Abbasi sometimes crossing the line into more sordid territory, it’s a genuinely alarming film with a distressing universal message about the value of women.\r\n\r\nFemale journalist Rahimi (Zar Amir-Ebrahimi) travels to the Iranian holy city of Mashhad to investigate a serial killer who is targeting local prostitutes. With skill and determination, every day brings her one step closer to exposing the perpetrator. When it’s discovered that the murderer is a charismatic family man named Saeed (Mehdi Bajestani), it seems like a cut-and-dried, slam dunk of a case, especially when he admits to his crimes. But when the killer brags that he is holy man who is on a divine mission from God to clean up the streets by ridding the city of corrupt, “dirty women,” he’s embraced by many as a hero. Shockingly, Saeed isn’t seen as guilty, making justice even harder to come by.\r\n\r\nAmir-Ebrahimi’s lead performance is wholly engrossing, and she portrays Rahimi with a forceful grace and intellect. She’s terrific as a journalist who is seeking justice yet trapped in an intense game of cat-and-mouse with a deranged serial killer who uses religion as an excuse to carry out over a dozen horrifying murders of women. Amir-Ebrahimi displays a composure that masks an underlying rage, and her strong performance carries the film.\r\n\r\nWhile the story is based on real events, co-writers Abbasi and Afshin Kamran Bahrami have crafted a work of fiction for the sake of entertainment. This is imagined storytelling and not the actual truth, even though parts of this story really happened. It’s alarming and unsettling, especially when the film recreates the murders in shocking fashion, and even more so when Rahimi is faced with the stark realities of deeply-rooted traditions of misogyny that are rampant in Iranian society (and quite frankly, around the globe).\r\n\r\n“Holy Spider” is an aggressive, unflinching film that will anger and enrage. By telling the story from a female’s point of view, it feels all the more disturbing and timely."

        "content": "Intolerance against members of the gay community has long been a theme in LGBTQ+ cinema, one that has become so common that it’s indeed familiar, if not overdone. However, when it’s set in a historical context, it can be valuable for illustrating how far this segment of society has come (and in a relatively short time, too), as well as a legacy instructional tool for younger members of the community. Such is apparently the intent behind writer-director Giuseppe Fiorello’s debut feature, a sincere effort at telling the fact-based story of a pair of teenage gay men (Gabriele Pizzuro, Samuele Segreto) in 1982 Sicily who face growing prejudice and harassment from locals and family members as their relationship begins to surface publicly. It’s a bittersweet heart-tugging tale of friendship, love, courage and undue bigotry that genuinely strikes a chord of sympathy with viewers. However, with a runtime of 2:13:00, it’s also needlessly long, especially at the outset, moving by at a snail’s pace that begins to grow tiresome by the film’s middle. The film also suffers from some uneven, inconsistent character development, making one wonder where some of its unexpected shifts in tone come from. Both of these issues are not entirely unexpected in the work of a first-time filmmaker, a creator who’s still learning about knowing when to “kill one’s darlings,” an error a little more than apparent here. Admittedly, the film finishes strongly in the final act, especially in its chilling conclusion. Nevertheless, the picture could have easily been cut by about 20 minutes without losing anything, and the director would have been wise to pursue that course (perhaps he will next time). It’s unfortunate that “Fireworks” ends up getting bogged down by its own narrative in light of the strength of its story and the importance of its message. We can never be reminded too much of where we’ve been so that we can avoid going back there again – and reliving the indignities that our predecessors had to endure."

This has two things that really work against it. It has obviously been made on a tiny budget and so the single camera combat photography and the very limited special effects do it no favours at all. Secondly, there is a distinct paucity of dragon! It does try to be a bit darker, their seemingly invincible masked opponents do emit a little menace, but it's far too wordy and the cast just don't make much of an impact with a rather well trammelled plot that joins the cinema dots all too predictably. Still, it's not the worst and director Lawrie Brewster is possibly guilty of trying too hard here rather than not trying hard enough - especially given the limited talent of his, well, talent! It's instantly forgettable television fodder, this - but if you like the genre (I do) then it's still just about worth a watch."

The Radio Silence team (Bettinnelli-Olpin and Gillett) prove they are the perfect new shepherds of the franchise. The four young survivors take giant leaps in character development as they grapple with the trauma, fallout, and spotlight of the last film's events. Their loyalty and care for each other draw immediate similarities to Sidney, Dewey, and Gale, which quickly endear the \"Core Four\" as beloved characters you desperately want to survive. The danger, kills, and gore all have been cranked up a notch, and for the first time in the franchise, even the survivors are possible Ghostfaces. I doubt and suspect everyone while simultaneously caring for them - that is masterful writing right there! On top of all that, having another legacy character back with Kirby Reed returning was fantastic. I loved this movie, but I really missed Dewey and Sidney. I also think the main Ghostface killer is a little too over the top when revealed, which keeps Scream (1996) and Scream (2022) ahead on my list. But those are incredibly minor complaints! Scream VI is another exceptional entry in the Scream franchise, and I hope we get another one soon!"

Still, it could hardly be much worse - and, as it happens, is actually really rather better. The plot still reminds me of something from an edition of \"Scooby Do\". The slasher manages to penetrate tight security; be in half a dozen places at one time; have access to secret phone numbers etc...; whilst those impaled appear to have a remarkable resilience for survival and recovery after an onslaught that would have felled an elephant. That's not the point, though. Unlike so many of the genre, this is actually quite scary and works well as a bit of a self-parody. If you've watched the others in the franchise, you will know how the dynamic plays out - and this is just an extension of that. The story doesn't really matter - it's the way in which the directors manage to imbue the whole thing with an entertaining degree of menace and paranoia, a few quite effective jump moments and by using a cast of relative non-entities (and by only using the wooden as a draining-board Courteney Cox sparingly), they manage to create a film that is actually a bit frightening at times. There are plenty of new characters for us to suspect including love interest Josh Segarra (\"Danny\") - who reminded me of Christian Bale, and the rather hapless Jack Champion's (\"Ethan\") before an ending that was, admittedly, quite ridiculous! This is not a film that will engage your brain on any level, but as piece of well constructed entertainment with some frequently quite witty dialogue and an eye watering encounter between a boy and a taser - it's well worth catching up with."

The first half was pretty messy, with a lot of new characters introduced and events taking place across multiple different locations. The New York setting created a multitude of interesting set pieces, but the spanning locations result in the movie being slightly unfocused at times. The film rushed through this introduction, which resulted in poor pacing. The second half was an intense, paranoia-inducing sequence that had me on the edge of my seat. As a whole, the movie worked well but could have been much better.\r\n\r\nThe best parts about Scream VI are the characters and the action. All of our returning cast is fantastic, and their chemistry works so well together. They are so great on screen that I feel as though the film does not really need the legacy characters, as they seem somewhat unnecessary. Our new cast members do fine in their roles, but they are not nearly as interesting as our core four. But that is fine in a slasher, as their role is to be carved up by Ghostface. This film is especially brutal, with some particularly gruesome kills and fantastic effects work to show the remains of our victims. There are a few kills that were top-notch and will go down as some of my favorites in the franchise. Scream VI is the first film for me that genuinely had me stressed. There are a few scenes that just linger for a moment too long and create an unsettling feeling in me that I thought worked really well. My favorite scene was the subway sequence, as my heart was pounding for genuinely two minutes straight.\r\n\r\nOther than the rushed first act, my only complaint has to do with the ending and some of the unbelievability in terms of our cast's survival. Although I do not think the final reveal was as bad as most reviewers make it out to be, I still think it could have been slightly better. I had one killer pegged from the beginning, but the other was a surprise, so I think they did a good job keeping the audience in the dark. Our characters take quite the beating in this film, with some being stabbed nearly a dozen times and still somehow being able to survive. It isn’t a huge deal, but it did take me out of the film a bit. Also, I spent nearly ten minutes of the movie trying to figure out how the hell Kirby was alive; I could have sworn she died in Scream 4.\r\n\r\nOverall, Scream VI was a welcomed addition to the franchise, even if it was not as good as Scream (2022). I do think my expectations were a bit high from the initial reactions, which may have led me to being slightly let down.\r\n\r\nScore: 68%\r\nVerdict: Good"

Gale Weathers makes an appearance, but the original cast is gone.\r\n\r\nAt the start, the main character walks up to some guy and says 'I'm gonna taze you in the balls', and does so. Instead of spending the rest of the movie in a jail cell on sexual assault charges, and then getting sued into the ground, the film just goes on. (The victim was a white male, so modern hollywood wants you to think it's 'funny' rather than disgusting.) From that point on, the main character is in no way an innocent victim, so it's hard to care that she's being pursued by a killer. The plot is mediocre, there are no funny or cool characters that the viewer might actually care about, and the killer's identity has reached the level of 'roommate's friend's brother's dogwalker', aka 'who cares'.

Lets start with whats bad. Unsurprisingly, more woke revisionist history. Yes, female empowerment was a big thing in Saxon times, apparently. I had no idea. I thought women were relegated to mostly domestic roles and had little say. \r\n\r\nQuestionable scripting. The script feels rushed and jumps into the story which almost feels like the second part of a tale, that needs more of a discovery back story. For those who have not watched the series, it is probably going to be, justifiably, really confusing. \r\n\r\nThe idiot decisions made by the lead character Uhtred, make little sense, either. Having regained his kingdom, Uhtred decides to back a royal family who, in the series, hung him out to dry.And worse still, they don't even ask nicely (but hey, female empowerment, right?). So off he blithely goes with his friends, risking everything for ungrateful, untrustworthy people, based on a promise, of sorts. Then it turns out the new King is an utter tyrant, influenced by his corrupt, gay boyfriend. As a note, homosexuality was not unheard of in Royal circles but to be this blatant, in this period of strict religiosity, at this level, would risk being dethroned, so it really doesn't ring true. Yet, Uhtred backs the King anyway. A real nobleman would and histrionically did, put distance between them and this kind of Royal behaviour. \r\n\r\nSuffice to say, the whole premise, stands on \"shaky legs\". \r\n\r\nIs there an upside? Yes, great acting in spite of a contrived story and decent Norsemen meets Saxon, swordplay action. Certainly, fight scenes were always this franchises strong point and that does not change.\r\n\r\nIn summary, let down by a weak tea, revisionist story that fails to adequately explain the primary characters inexplicable motivations (not that they really make much sense). Upside is limited. Decent acting and action scenes but really its more a consolation prize, than anything else. Watch the series instead, in this reviewers opinion, its vastly superior."

A conclusion that didn't feel necessary as the story ended with a satisfying resolution and characters we had grown to love over five seasons finding happiness and a rewarding future. Instead, this 2-hour movie is more of a finale that disrupts our story's happy ending and leaves it all with less closure than before. With the promise of a \"movie,\" I was hoping that the film would enjoy greater production quality and resources than the typical show, but that was not the case. Seven Kings Must Die was just an entire season of The Last Kingdom crammed into 2 hours. Fans of the series might enjoy seeing more of their favorite characters (although they might be disappointed with the conclusion of those characters' stories). Unfortunately, those unfamiliar with The Last Kingdom would be confused by the partial narrative they receive with this film. Seven King Must Die might have been a decent finale to an additional season of the show, but as someone who liked how the show ended, I wish I had joined my wife and gone to bed without finishing the film. The show is excellent, so watch that instead. It really isn't as bad as I am sharing, but I was happier as a fan without it, and non-fans would probably not find it worth their time, either."

It is intimately filmed by Marie Lidén offering us quite a painful-to-watch glimpse of the man's existence that, intercut with some of his earlier, happier, home movie footage with his erstwhile girlfriend, tells a rather sad story. Now, here is my problem with this - and I fully expect to be shot down. Is it real? This man lives is Sweden. One of the most advanced economies in the world. Surely someone would have designed an actual hat, and/or a suit for him to wear that would have offered the same protection and greater mobility than him having to shuffle around attired like a man from an \"Addams Family\" movie. He is apparently one of three people from the same public library to have contracted this illness in quick succession - yet we don't hear from either of the others. Indeed one - his former partner - appears to have gone on to live a full and fruitful life. Is he just that much more susceptible? There are contributors - but aside from his family, they are lay-people who are unattributed onscreen. There are no medical or scientific personnel participating here to offer us any explanation as to just what \"radiation\" actually might be, or to put some context around this man's undoubtedly depressing predicament. It is an interesting watch, but as it progressed - the distinct lack of scientific and/or medical critique and/or validation led me to wonder if this could even be an hoax!"

Directed by Charles Roxburgh (who co-wrote the screenplay with Matt Farley), this low budget sci-fi comedy about a time machine rock is not without its charms.\r\n\r\nWalter (Farley) lives in the small New England town of Tussleville. He hosts a local talent show that only airs live, and hangs out with his friend and cousin Poopy (Chris Peterson). While chatting, the two men realize that their dear departed Uncle Dan (Kevin McGee) visited them as a ghost when they were kids, using his drop-in from the afterlife to plant a rhyme in their head about the town’s very own magic spot. If you stand on a certain rock during the winter, you’ll be transported back in time and into the beyond with the ability to observe but not interact with the past.\r\n\r\nThere’s a lot to like about this black and white, time traveling musical about a specter uncle, a close-knit small town with an affinity for melting provolone slices on top of pizza, and dynamic family relationships. The humor is hit or miss, but the cast of non-professional hometown actors and musicians is delightful, if not always talented. The film feels like the kind of project you’d make in the backyard as a vehicle to showcase your relatives and friends. With a more sophisticated and downright charming plot, this is the better of the director’s other entry at Fantastic Fest this year, “Heard She Got Married.”\r\n\r\n“Magic Spot” has an engaging story and a nice sentiment about the joys of not living in the past so you can start experiencing the present. This is an example of true independent cinema that will be enjoyed by audiences willing to invest the time and take the plunge."

It principally centres on the young \"Bill\" (JoJo Bapteise Whiting) who is juggling two girlfriends, two young children, and aspirations to buy and breed a rather mangy looking poodle! When he happens by a successful farmer whose car has broken down by the side of the road, he sees a way to make some extra cash. The two men click and pretty soon \"Bill\" is packaging turkey jerky by the bucketload! Meantime, the younger \"Matho\" (LaDainian Crazy Thunder) has been thrown out of his father's home after he and his pals compromised his cocaine business by adding a little epsom salts to their distribution network! Both stories see the men and their friends and families trying to get by in a community that seems to exist for the sake of it. Poodles notwithstanding, there seems little structure to their lives nor much point to anything. Opportunities are sparse and family loyalties only appear to endure when convenient. It's actually quite a depressing story that I couldn't help wonder might not have been worthy of watching at all, had it not been for the native American aspects to the production and plot. Despite that increasingly prevailing downbeat theme, there is something likeable about Whiting's characterisation of the wayward \"Bill\" - a man who does seem to at least want to escape the relentlessness of their existence. The ending is weak, though, and frankly really quite daft and as an whole, the film does drag a bit across the two hours of rather soporifically scored, slowly paced, drama. It's worth a watch, but it's not great."

For those who really don't know what these words mean: promotion means to encourage, to support something. And depiction means to show something, to make people aware of something by showing it to them.\r\n\r\nNow, Joyland, nowhere in its 126 minutes run supports or encourages or \"promotes\" homosexuality or anything that is anti-Islamic. In fact, this isn't even the only theme of the film. It covers pretty much every aspect of the domestic life of a lower middle-class Pakistani man and a woman (I didn't mention transgender persons because those poor things have only one class of lifestyle). It shows every harsh reality of our society. It shows all the plagues our country is being devoured by, those which aren't remotely related to Islam but have become a part of our tradition despite being highly toxic. These are the stigmas that we suffer from in our lives but no one wants to get rid of them because they have been here for so long that they have become normal. And a life without them would be abnormal or even disgraceful and shameful according to our \"elders\".\r\n\r\nThe film does show the homosexuality that exists in our country. It doesn't tell whether its good or bad, it just shows it. The only thing that could be a negative point in my opinion would be the graphic scenes. They weren't really that necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I would say that Joyland is probably the best film that's come out of Pakistani industry in a long time. We need to support such films and accept the existence of all the brutalities of the society they make us aware about. And lastly, try to do something about them."

As we progress, however, we discover that there is a bit more to \"Biba\" the originally thought and as the two become friends we also discover a little more behind the reasons why a son is so slow in coming for the otherwise loving married couple. There is an effective chemistry between Khan and Junejo and as the story unfolds we are exposed to quite a few scenarios that challenge established (admittedly, Western) views of just how society should operate - from the role of both women and men through to the increasingly obvious issues faced by people who don't run in that linear two-horse race. It is funny at times and the dialogue is efficient at helping this characterful story along towards the denouement. Now this is where I felt a little disappointed. Not that it doesn't work - but somehow it seemed to me to be a bit of a sad cop-out from the writers who almost seemed to go along with the prevailing spirit of compliance at all costs. Still, you must judge that for yourselves if you watch it - which I suggest that you do."

Some of the \"wake-up\" songs are quite good but whoever concluded that delivering us a host of scientists doing pieces-to-camera was going to prove engaging just, in my opinion, missed an \"oppy\" to populate this with much more of the imagery NASA collected.

In the summer of 2003, the space agency launched twin robots on a journey to Mars to search for evidence of life. This film tells the true story of “Oppy,” her sister Spirit, and their incredible adventure on another planet.\r\n\r\nIt’s an irresistible American success story of teamwork, dedication, brainpower, and resolve. After carefully planning and designing the rovers, NASA sent the twins to the Red Planet on a groundbreaking mission — with a life expectancy of only 90 days. With a stroke of luck, Oppy ended up surviving for 15 years, sending back incredible data and photographs that changed the shape of astronomy and history. Through photo-real visual effects and animation by Industrial Light & Magic, the film captures the exploration with eye-popping wonder. And by talking with the scientists, engineers, operators, and the amazing team of people behind the scenes, White beautifully expresses the emotional bond that was formed between Oppy and her humans back on Earth.\r\n\r\nIt’s incredible how easy it is to get emotionally invested in Oppy’s mission. From the original blueprint to the rover’s very first steps, I found myself cheering along with mission control when things were going well, and sharing in their disappointments when they faced major obstacles. The story is fascinating and almost unbelievable, as Oppy and Spirit mange to survive disaster after disaster, from getting stuck in sand to weathering months-long solar and dust storms. I was on the edge of my seat as I waited to see the fate of these rovers, watching and waiting and holding my breath along with the folks back at NASA.\r\n\r\nBy combining the true stories of the folks that lived them with CGI scenes that play like an action film, White makes this story of robotic geologists fun. It’s an engaging and sentimental documentary, and one that surprisingly runs the gamut of emotions. It doesn’t hurt that Oppy and Spirit have an adorable, WALL-E like quality and appearance, either. The two rovers start to feel human, especially when current and former employees at NASA refer to Oppy’s age-related conditions after years on Mars. She begins to develop “arthritis” in her “arms,” her vision becomes blurry, and she begins to have problems with memory and forgetfulness. It’s only a matter of time before she powers down and doesn’t wake up, and it’s a gut punch when that day finally arrives.\r\n\r\n“Good Night Oppy” is an exemplary documentary that had this astronomy nerd smiling from ear to ear. It’s a story about curiosity, exploration discovery, the ingenuity of humans, and their love for the little rover that could."

It’s a celebration of the state and its natural diversity, exploring every region from the famous Hill country, the Southern plains, the Panhandle, the Piney Woods, and the Gulf coast. The film touches on green political commentary that’s expressed with a very gentle hand, making it the type of project that has the potential to sway the opinions, hearts, and minds of anti-environmentalists and others who are uninterested in the conservation conversation.\r\n\r\nThe film is narrated by Matthew McConaughey, a proud, native Texan, and he’s the perfect choice. His voice is soothing yet authoritative, and he reads like an expert on the subject. The script is well-written and engaging, giving even more personality to the of abundance of adorable critters. Masters crafts his gorgeous footage in a way that builds excitement (watch as a newborn bat is stalked by a snake) and gets viewers close-up with the animals as they go about their daily routines.\r\n\r\nThe visual moments captured in this film are absolutely jaw-dropping. There’s rare video of an ocelot hunting, amazing scenes of blind catfish, and emotionally devastating footage of mountain lion traps. Masters turns his lens on some of the state’s most interesting animals, including redfish, bears, alligators, and dolphins. The most interesting segments are an extended exploration of the breeding patterns of the strange looking alligator gar, a massive fish that has lived in the rivers of Texas for over 70 million years, and a particularly effective piece on the horrible cruelty of steel-jaw leg traps (the film does not shy away from strong criticism of the backwards thinking of the state and its lack of science-based, humane control methods).\r\n\r\nThis documentary is appropriate for children, but it does feature some very sad moments (nature has a circle of life, after all). It’s academic and informative, but never dry or boring. The nature photography alone is spectacular, and the educational information presented feels new and exciting. It’s a great way to learn about the Texas ecosystems, animals on land and underwater, climate change, and the role we as humans have in both conserving and destroying the planet.\r\n\r\n“Deep in the Heart” ends with a rousing call to action and appeal for conservation that feels particularly aimed at Texans and ranchers. “The future is our choice,” McConaughey reads with great emotion, as pictures of endangered and threatened animals flash on screen. This is a handsome nature documentary with a strong message that’s beautifully done."

I quickly realized that for some reason I was starting ten minutes into it, but it didn’t seem to matter.\r\n\r\nJudging from other reviews, they didn’t spend enough money on the dinosaur effects, but personally I would have liked to see them spend more on the script. The dinosaurs hunted, howled, bit and swallowed and that was good enough for me. But I got several smiles out of the cast running from the creatures and not closing the heavy doors behind them. I mean, never. Apparently some of the people were selected for the compound because of special skills or occupations, while a few of the ladies were picked for how they looked in low-cut blouses, I assume. And if they are low enough on food and medical supplies so that they have to leave the compound to stock up, they could take comfort from the fact that they still had a ready supply of mascara and other makeup. (My wife pointed out that they obviously didn’t get out much so of course they would still have plenty!)\r\n\r\nI guess they didn’t want to copy Jurassic Park by jeopardizing children, so they opted for an unborn baby instead. I can’t say I was drawn to like any of the characters, which had the advantage of making me less concerned about who ultimately survived.\r\n\r\nOkay, it isn’t a great movie, but it does try, bless it."

Anyway, he buys it, takes it for a hurl, leaves it outside his house and it's pinched. The police don't care, so he and his brother decide to track it down - easily done as it happens - and that puts in train a series of rather predictable, sometimes comically violent, daft escapades as the brothers tackle the local bullies, the local kingpin and make it clear that their family is not one to be messed with. It helps that it is set in Bristol - a more genteel environment for the cast on screen here. This would not have worked in a gritty, more working class city, but here you can overlook the \"posh-boy\" elements of the casting and just enjoy what is a quite well written and decently directed low-budget feature. The ending is a wee bit farcical, but there's familial chemistry to be seen here and the acting, though not likely to garner a BAFTA, makes for an engaging look at a family looking out for each other. No, you won't remember it afterwards - but it is worth a watch and you're bound to recall some of the music if you were around in the eighties."

Similar goes with Don Johnson. The rest are below average, at best. Worse, somehow, though is the Mimi/Tom/Becky/Kaitlyn family thing, genuinely some of the most annoying and uninteresting characters I've ever seen - severe eye rolls every single time they appeared onscreen, including for one painfully overlong car scene.\r\n\r\nIt would be harsh to only call out the actors though, given they are only doing what they are requested to do of course. Zach Golden & Co. did just a weak a job as the acting talent. The dialogue is woeful, as is the humour, the editing, the pacing and probably anything else you could think of.

More experimental than straightforward, this is a film that’s filled with difficult themes. While it may not be easy to watch, this is a potent drama with solid writing.\r\n\r\nIt’s a sweltering summer in Redhook, Brooklyn, and the Trout family is staring down the poverty line when the man of the house can’t seem to find work. He’s desperately looking for anything he can get in order to provide income to his family, but it’s not making things any better for the others who share the apartment. Tensions are heightened when their estranged son returns after being away for over a decade. It’s an ominous reunion that brings painful, long-buried memories to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe story takes place around the family’s kitchen table as they deal with old (and new) wounds that run deep. From far-reaching guilt and regret to alcoholism and debt, this isn’t the type of movie that makes you feel good. But by exploring tough issues like the underlying trauma of this American family, Fields paints an honest portrait of working class struggles.\r\n\r\nThis is a conversational drama with effective writing and intelligent verbal exchanges between the characters. The cast is terrific, and their performances complement the dialogue. There’s no action, only words, which means the screenplay and the actors are called on to do most of the heavy lifting.\r\n\r\nFields sets the mood with a haunting score and handsome directing, and the cinematography has a noir-ish quality that fits the material well. The film could benefit from a quicker pacing, but “Brutal Season” completely achieves the tone it was going for."

Genre film fests are among the most interesting because they showcase independent horror, sci-fi, fantasy, and other avant-garde, eccentric, micro-budget works of art. That’s why director Mike Cheslik‘s “Hundreds of Beavers” was the perfect fit for Fantastic Fest. This black and white game of man vs. beaver is my favorite film that I saw at the festival this year, and it’s not even close.\r\n\r\nIn what I can only describe as a Looney Tunes cartoon meets Charlie Chaplin meets “Cannibal! The Musical,” this dialogue-free film tells the story of an often-drunk applejack salesman who wants to become the greatest fur trapper in North America. The only way he can reach his goal is to defeat hundreds of beavers in the snow-covered woods. It’s a simple plot, but the humor is on point and the situations our hero finds himself in are absolutely hilarious. Those with a penchant for slapstick will appreciate the whimsy that defines the entire film.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is a silent film with no dialogue, it’s engrossing from the get-go. To make a project like this so interesting takes a different kind of skill from a filmmaking team, and Cheslik along with co-writer Ryland Brickson Cole Tews have an intuitive flair for the farcical and absurd. You’d think the one hour and forty eight minute run time would be excessive, but it doesn’t feel overly long at all. That’s just astounding and is a testament to how strong the storytelling is.\r\n\r\nTo reveal too many plot points would ruin the surprises because this is a film about discovery in the moment. Even the look of the beavers is hysterical, and when paired with goofy, exaggerated facial expressions and scenes that are reminiscent of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Roadrunner, it’s easy to become engrossed in the absurdity of it all. As the trapper begins to eliminate his furry foes one by one, crude animation registers the beaver kills. His traps become more inventive, clever, and outrageous as he embarks on his quest to annihilate a forest full of beavers.\r\n\r\nThe film ends with a spectacular sled and snowball chase finale that’s as exciting as it is ridiculous, and the humor drifts between dark and lighthearted with ease. “Hundreds of Beavers” is a true achievement in oddball independent filmmaking, and I am here for every last drop of it."

The former is \"Grace\" - a woman who lives in a rundown Glasgow high-rise with her daughter \"Ama\". Their's is a loving relationship tinged with a little maternal paranoia. \"Grace\" is forced to work as a cleaner at night and the girl is largely forbidden from leaving the flat - for her own safety - and that, naturally, attracts the attention of the social workers and the school teachers who are concerned for their wellbeing. Things are not helped by a decision to rehouse the family as the demolition men are soon to head to their tower block. When \"Ama\" befriends a neighbour from her school \"Fiona\" (a nice effort from Liana Turner), the couple's relationship starts to become severely tested and the two women face the first serious change to the established dynamic of their inter-dependency. The performances do go some way to making this film work, but the absence of context makes it difficult to engage with the story. We don't really know anything about the past that drove them to Scotland. Clearly there has been trauma for \"Grace\", but again - we know very little about what created that trouble. The direction is also very lethargic. Far too many tracking shots, walking to and fro, almost like director Adura Onashile was paddling out a short story into almost ninety minutes. I also found it to be rather over-scored. The paucity of dialogue does work at times, but the sense of loneliness and fear that generates is all to frequently overpowered by the music. It's an interesting story that is probably illustrative of many families relocated to a strange environment, but I just needed more substance and less meandering images for that to resonate better."

I would've liked to have see more of them in truth, though both are still positive additions - particularly Chinn. Christopher Innvar is solid in his role too, even with the major Jonathan Hyde/Sam Parrish vibe his character had going on.\r\n\r\nThey do well in connecting all the dots in the story, I especially enjoyed the stuff with Matula's Katherine (Marley... nicely done) and Liana Hunt's Betsey, which is rather sweet.

While this portrayal of Hite’s life story may come across as dull, she caused major waves with the 1976 publication of her groundbreaking study that surveyed the secret sexual habits of women titled “The Hite Report.” Director Nicole Newnham‘s film makes a deep dive into the life story of this intellectual, bisexual artist and author in a compelling piece of feminist cinema.\r\n\r\nNarrated by Dakota Johnson as Hite, Newnham uses Hite’s own words to tell her story (as well as interviews with her friends and those who knew her best). Johnson reads from Hite’s diary, books, and letters, eschewing her dislike of the sexist world of modeling, advertising, and academia. It should go without saying that the film features explicit dialogue, heavy sexual content, and frank, honest discussions about sex, so those easily offended will want to skip this one. For anyone with a natural curiosity and interest in learning about one of the most influential women to ever challenge society’s female sexuality myths, this documentary provides a detailed education\r\n\r\nHite’s first book focused solely on female sexuality (her second, male) and was comprised of nationwide anonymous survey responses from random, real people. By answering questions in this manner, it allowed respondents to be refreshingly and completely honest and open. This painted a truthful picture that challenged the restrictive, traditional ideas of sex, sparking a dialogue about women’s pleasure, and empowering women to learn about their own bodies and take control of their suppressed sexuality. Unsurprisingly, this made waves, especially in more conservative circles.\r\n\r\nHite’s surveys exposed something that really hit a nerve, especially with men who became frightened and threatened just by the idea of women having any sort of power (sound familiar, ladies?). The books were too much for many males to handle, so criticism of Hite’s work skyrocketed. A strong and outspoken woman, Hite was saying and publishing things, true things, that people just didn’t want to hear. It’s human nature, but ignoring them or attempting to discredit them didn’t make them any less true. Eventually, the court of public opinion derailed her popularity and career as an author.\r\n\r\n“The Disappearance of Shere Hite” tells the story of an early form of “cancel culture” in a way, as the backlash of the author’s controversial work also led to her downfall. The documentary is interesting, but the material is stretched a little thin for a feature length."

        "content": "Despite the considerable social progress that the LGBTQ+ community has made in recent years, there are still some places around the world where the act of coming out is questionable and deeply troubling. In some cases, such a step raises serious issues about social acceptance, as well as self-preservation and legal ramifications. It may even prompt some individuals to doubt their genuine intuitive impulses about their natural inclinations just to be able to fit in. Such is the case in Nigeria, as depicted in the debut feature from writer-director Babatunde Apalowo, a Nigerian-born filmmaker based in the UK. In his first feature release, Apalowo tells the story of Bambino (Tope Tedela), a motorcycle deliveryman who meets and befriends Bawa (Riyo David), an aspiring photographer with whom he starts spending considerable time, a connection that carries implications greater than just friendship. However, given the country’s social taboos and illegality considerations, as well as sustained pressure from Efeyinwa (Martha Ehinome Orhiere), a neighbor who wants to become Bambino’s wife, the budding relationship between the two men remains at arm’s length. Bambino has doubts about his own sexuality, while Bawa believes that he and his new companion are destined for something deeper and more meaningful. But will that happen? The film probes this question as the two men tenuously circle one another, trying to figure out what’s next. Admittedly, the pacing here can be somewhat on the slow side at times, but that’s understandable given the circumstances under which they’re operating. But, by taking this approach, the filmmaker has an opportunity to present their story in a highly sensual way, one that creates ample sexual tension that’s fittingly augmented by the picture’s carefully framed shots, many of which allow the actors to convey tremendous depth of feeling merely with facial expressions and body language. The tone, message and style of filmmaking are all reminiscent of filmmaker Barry Jenkins’s Oscar-winning best picture “Moonlight” (2016), a perspective that carries significant ramifications in a culture that often denies the very existence of gay individuals within its ranks. The film thereby provides a revelatory look into a segment of society that many don’t recognize, understand or acknowledge. Like this film’s American counterpart, however, it’s imperative that viewers have patience with this one, giving it time to develop and emerge with a story that’s heartfelt, eye-opening, and, above all, rewarding."

        "content": "\"The Trade\" is a gripping crime drama film, directed by Jadesola Osiberu, that draws inspiration from the true story of a notorious kidnapper who terrorized southern Nigeria for over a decade. Blossom Chukwuejukwu plays the elusive kidnapper, Eric, while Rita Dominic portrays one of his unfortunate victims. The film boasts an ensemble cast of talented Nollywood veterans, including Ali Nuhu, Chiwetalu Agu, Gideon Okeke, and Shawn Faqua, among others.\r\n\r\nOne of the film's most notable strengths is its ability to showcase Nigeria's diversity in terms of culture and religion. The film features engaging shots that open a window into various aspects of Nigerian culture, which are not commonly portrayed in popular movies. This exploration of the country's diversity is a refreshing addition to the typical Nollywood fare.\r\n\r\nAnother strength of the film is its subtle approach to Eric's character. The audience is not explicitly told that Eric is a kidnapper, but instead experiences his actions and interactions with other characters. This approach makes Eric more dangerous and unpredictable, as he blends in with the crowd like an average Nigerian man. The performances of the cast are also noteworthy, with Osiberu's direction helping to build tension as Eric moves from one kidnapping to another until he meets Rita Dominic's character.\r\n\r\nThe humor that occasionally punctuates the film provides much-needed relief from the dark subject matter, while the satisfying ending delivers a just conclusion to Eric's criminal activities. However, the film is not without its flaws. The audio quality was subpar, making it difficult to hear or understand. Inconsistency in the \"r\" factor in the speeches of some Igbo characters also detracted from the film's overall quality.\r\n\r\nCertain scenes were not well-executed, such as the kidnapping of Rita Dominic, which appeared too easy, or the police officer's shooting, which was poorly edited. Some parts of the story felt rushed, such as how the police obtained the phone and SIM cards or how they tracked down Eric's location from Chris's phone. These flaws left some parts of the story feeling incomplete and not allowing the audience to fully take in the evidence. The car crash scene was also unrealistic, while the death of Shawn Faqua's character, who seemed to be an antagonist, did not evoke any emotion.\r\n\r\nOverall, \"The Trade\" is an enjoyable Nollywood movie that offers something different from the norm, with excellent locations, a great cast, and an engaging plot. The film's technical aspects, some scenes, and certain characters would benefit from improvement, but it is still worth watching for those seeking a crime drama with a Nigerian flavor."

This film manages to achieve in 3 minutes what many feature films fail to do in 3 hours: it makes you feel. \r\n\r\nWhether you believe in ghosts or not, this story will warm your heart. It subtly uncovers precepts inherent to mankind; you will eventually find solace in grief; we are all a community. But most of all, _Metaphysical Comfort_ shows you that you are never alone. In times of sorrow, in times of joy, we are always here for each other. And this is an attribute that can never be stolen, not even by the cruel thief that is Death. \r\n\r\n**I’m touched metaphysically by this film and I don’t even have a ghost comforting me.**\r\n\r\nThis short is truly the most impressive directorial debut I can remember in years and without a doubt speaks volumes on Arikatota’s work to come."

        "content": "Off of a recommendation from a friend, I listened to Bob Frank's debut album from 1972, and almost immediately I was met with music that had beautifully succinct vocal and lyrical storytelling accompanied by considered instrumentation. Looking at the album's reception on Spotify and RateYourMusic, I was surprised to see how 'unknown' it was, considering how solidly written the whole record is. But after watching this documentary, knowing its entire history, it's lovely to see that while that number is low, the community surrounding his music is dedicated and passionate.\r\n\r\nI'm so glad that we got this documentary, and that we have a source for more information about Bob Frank's life beyond with what he did with Vanguard. What I love most about _**Within A Few Degrees**_ is that it doesn't beg more from Bob; it doesn't dwell on the would-be's of the past, but rather celebrates his present accomplishments. Bob Frank is content man, we do not see an ounce of regret from him here. In fact, he is successful according to his own terms; he had a family and he wrote songs, and that's what made him happy. \r\n\r\nThe best part of this whole documentary happens when we pass the Vanguard era, the moment of his resurgence during the 2000s. During the interview portions involving Frank, he is dismissive and somewhat callous of his career. But when we do see him performing his art, rather than just talking about it, with people in the room actively enjoying what he had created, he glows and softens a bit. Added that with the parts of the fans and their anecdotes, the documentary ends with a sweet and satisfactory answer to the question: \"What's Bob Frank up to?\". \r\n\r\n_Bob Frank, 1944 - 2019_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTaken from Letterboxd: https://boxd.it/4II5Zz"
